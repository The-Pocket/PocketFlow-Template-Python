  8: # Chapter 1: Agent - The Workers of AutoGen
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the AutoGen Core tutorial! We're excited to guide you through building powerful applications with autonomous agents.
 11: 
 12: ## Motivation: Why Do We Need Agents?
 13: 
 14: Imagine you want to build an automated system to write blog posts. You might need one part of the system to research a topic and another part to write the actual post based on the research. How do you represent these different "workers" and make them talk to each other?
 15: 
 16: This is where the concept of an **Agent** comes in. In AutoGen Core, an `Agent` is the fundamental building block representing an actor or worker in your system. Think of it like an employee in an office.
 17: 
 18: ## Key Concepts: Understanding Agents
 19: 
 20: Let's break down what makes an Agent:
 21: 
 22: 1.  **It's a Worker:** An Agent is designed to *do* things. This could be running calculations, calling a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT, using a tool (like a search engine), or managing a piece of data.
 23: 2.  **It Has an Identity (`AgentId`):** Just like every employee has a name and a job title, every Agent needs a unique identity. This identity, called `AgentId`, has two parts:
 24:     *   `type`: What kind of role does the agent have? (e.g., "researcher", "writer", "coder"). This helps organize agents.
 25:     *   `key`: A unique name for this specific agent instance (e.g., "researcher-01", "amy-the-writer").
 26: 
 27:     ```python
 28:     # From: _agent_id.py
 29:     class AgentId:
 30:         def __init__(self, type: str, key: str) -> None:
 31:             # ... (validation checks omitted for brevity)
 32:             self._type = type
 33:             self._key = key
 34: 
 35:         @property
 36:         def type(self) -> str:
 37:             return self._type
 38: 
 39:         @property
 40:         def key(self) -> str:
 41:             return self._key
 42: 
 43:         def __str__(self) -> str:
 44:             # Creates an id like "researcher/amy-the-writer"
 45:             return f"{self._type}/{self._key}"
 46:     ```
 47:     This `AgentId` acts like the agent's address, allowing other agents (or the system) to send messages specifically to it.
 48: 
 49: 3.  **It Has Metadata (`AgentMetadata`):** Besides its core identity, an agent often has descriptive information.
 50:     *   `type`: Same as in `AgentId`.
 51:     *   `key`: Same as in `AgentId`.
 52:     *   `description`: A human-readable explanation of what the agent does (e.g., "Researches topics using web search").
 53: 
 54:     ```python
 55:     # From: _agent_metadata.py
 56:     from typing import TypedDict
 57: 
 58:     class AgentMetadata(TypedDict):
 59:         type: str
 60:         key: str
 61:         description: str
 62:     ```
 63:     This metadata helps understand the agent's purpose within the system.
 64: 
 65: 4.  **It Communicates via Messages:** Agents don't work in isolation. They collaborate by sending and receiving messages. The primary way an agent receives work is through its `on_message` method. Think of this like the agent's inbox.
 66: 
 67:     ```python
 68:     # From: _agent.py (Simplified Agent Protocol)
 69:     from typing import Any, Mapping, Protocol
 70:     # ... other imports
 71: 
 72:     class Agent(Protocol):
 73:         @property
 74:         def id(self) -> AgentId: ... # The agent's unique ID
 75: 
 76:         async def on_message(self, message: Any, ctx: MessageContext) -> Any:
 77:             """Handles an incoming message."""
 78:             # Agent's logic to process the message goes here
 79:             ...
 80:     ```
 81:     When an agent receives a message, `on_message` is called. The `message` contains the data or task, and `ctx` (MessageContext) provides extra information about the message (like who sent it). We'll cover `MessageContext` more later.
 82: 
 83: 5.  **It Can Remember Things (State):** Sometimes, an agent needs to remember information between tasks, like keeping notes on research progress. Agents can optionally implement `save_state` and `load_state` methods to store and retrieve their internal memory.
 84: 
 85:     ```python
 86:     # From: _agent.py (Simplified Agent Protocol)
 87:     class Agent(Protocol):
 88:         # ... other methods
 89: 
 90:         async def save_state(self) -> Mapping[str, Any]:
 91:             """Save the agent's internal memory."""
 92:             # Return a dictionary representing the state
 93:             ...
 94: 
 95:         async def load_state(self, state: Mapping[str, Any]) -> None:
 96:             """Load the agent's internal memory."""
 97:             # Restore state from the dictionary
 98:             ...
 99:     ```
100:     We'll explore state and memory in more detail in [Chapter 7: Memory](07_memory.md).
101: 
102: 6.  **Different Agent Types:** AutoGen Core provides base classes to make creating agents easier:
103:     *   `BaseAgent`: The fundamental class most agents inherit from. It provides common setup.
104:     *   `ClosureAgent`: A very quick way to create simple agents using just a function (like hiring a temp worker for a specific task defined on the spot).
105:     *   `RoutedAgent`: An agent that can automatically direct different types of messages to different internal handler methods (like a smart receptionist).
106: 
107: ## Use Case Example: Researcher and Writer
108: 
109: Let's revisit our blog post example. We want a `Researcher` agent and a `Writer` agent.
110: 
111: **Goal:**
112: 1.  Tell the `Researcher` a topic (e.g., "AutoGen Agents").
113: 2.  The `Researcher` finds some facts (we'll keep it simple and just make them up for now).
114: 3.  The `Researcher` sends these facts to the `Writer`.
115: 4.  The `Writer` receives the facts and drafts a short post.
116: 
117: **Simplified Implementation Idea (using `ClosureAgent` for brevity):**
118: 
119: First, let's define the messages they might exchange:
120: 
121: ```python
122: from dataclasses import dataclass
123: 
124: @dataclass
125: class ResearchTopic:
126:     topic: str
127: 
128: @dataclass
129: class ResearchFacts:
130:     topic: str
131:     facts: list[str]
132: 
133: @dataclass
134: class DraftPost:
135:     topic: str
136:     draft: str
137: ```
138: These are simple Python classes to hold the data being passed around.
139: 
140: Now, let's imagine defining the `Researcher` using a `ClosureAgent`. This agent will listen for `ResearchTopic` messages.
141: 
142: ```python
143: # Simplified concept - requires AgentRuntime (Chapter 3) to actually run
144: 
145: async def researcher_logic(agent_context, message: ResearchTopic, msg_context):
146:     print(f"Researcher received topic: {message.topic}")
147:     # In a real scenario, this would involve searching, calling an LLM, etc.
148:     # For now, we just make up facts.
149:     facts = [f"Fact 1 about {message.topic}", f"Fact 2 about {message.topic}"]
150:     print(f"Researcher found facts: {facts}")
151: 
152:     # Find the Writer agent's ID (we assume we know it)
153:     writer_id = AgentId(type="writer", key="blog_writer_1")
154: 
155:     # Send the facts to the Writer
156:     await agent_context.send_message(
157:         message=ResearchFacts(topic=message.topic, facts=facts),
158:         recipient=writer_id,
159:     )
160:     print("Researcher sent facts to Writer.")
161:     # This agent doesn't return a direct reply
162:     return None
163: ```
164: This `researcher_logic` function defines *what* the researcher does when it gets a `ResearchTopic` message. It processes the topic, creates `ResearchFacts`, and uses `agent_context.send_message` to send them to the `writer` agent.
165: 
166: Similarly, the `Writer` agent would have its own logic:
167: 
168: ```python
169: # Simplified concept - requires AgentRuntime (Chapter 3) to actually run
170: 
171: async def writer_logic(agent_context, message: ResearchFacts, msg_context):
172:     print(f"Writer received facts for topic: {message.topic}")
173:     # In a real scenario, this would involve LLM prompting
174:     draft = f"Blog Post about {message.topic}:\n"
175:     for fact in message.facts:
176:         draft += f"- {fact}\n"
177:     print(f"Writer drafted post:\n{draft}")
178: 
179:     # Perhaps save the draft or send it somewhere else
180:     # For now, we just print it. We don't send another message.
181:     return None # Or maybe return a confirmation/result
182: ```
183: This `writer_logic` function defines how the writer reacts to receiving `ResearchFacts`.
184: 
185: **Important:** To actually *run* these agents and make them communicate, we need the `AgentRuntime` (covered in [Chapter 3: AgentRuntime](03_agentruntime.md)) and the `Messaging System` (covered in [Chapter 2: Messaging System](02_messaging_system__topic___subscription_.md)). For now, focus on the *idea* that Agents are distinct workers defined by their logic (`on_message`) and identified by their `AgentId`.
186: 
187: ## Under the Hood: How an Agent Gets a Message
188: 
189: While the full message delivery involves the `Messaging System` and `AgentRuntime`, let's look at the agent's role when it receives a message.
190: 
191: **Conceptual Flow:**
192: 
193: ```mermaid
194: sequenceDiagram
195:     participant Sender as Sender Agent
196:     participant Runtime as AgentRuntime
197:     participant Recipient as Recipient Agent
198: 
199:     Sender->>+Runtime: send_message(message, recipient_id)
200:     Runtime->>+Recipient: Locate agent by recipient_id
201:     Runtime->>+Recipient: on_message(message, context)
202:     Recipient->>Recipient: Process message using internal logic
203:     alt Response Needed
204:         Recipient->>-Runtime: Return response value
205:         Runtime->>-Sender: Deliver response value
206:     else No Response
207:         Recipient->>-Runtime: Return None (or no return)
208:     end
209: ```
210: 
211: 1.  Some other agent (Sender) or the system decides to send a message to our agent (Recipient).
212: 2.  It tells the `AgentRuntime` (the manager): "Deliver this `message` to the agent with `recipient_id`".
213: 3.  The `AgentRuntime` finds the correct `Recipient` agent instance.
214: 4.  The `AgentRuntime` calls the `Recipient.on_message(message, context)` method.
215: 5.  The agent's internal logic inside `on_message` (or methods called by it, like in `RoutedAgent`) runs to process the message.
216: 6.  If the message requires a direct response (like an RPC call), the agent returns a value from `on_message`. If not (like a general notification or event), it might return `None`.
217: 
218: **Code Glimpse:**
219: 
220: The core definition is the `Agent` Protocol (`_agent.py`). It's like an interface or a contract – any class wanting to be an Agent *must* provide these methods.
221: 
222: ```python
223: # From: _agent.py - The Agent blueprint (Protocol)
224: 
225: @runtime_checkable
226: class Agent(Protocol):
227:     @property
228:     def metadata(self) -> AgentMetadata: ...
229: 
230:     @property
231:     def id(self) -> AgentId: ...
232: 
233:     async def on_message(self, message: Any, ctx: MessageContext) -> Any: ...
234: 
235:     async def save_state(self) -> Mapping[str, Any]: ...
236: 
237:     async def load_state(self, state: Mapping[str, Any]) -> None: ...
238: 
239:     async def close(self) -> None: ...
240: ```
241: 
242: Most agents you create will inherit from `BaseAgent` (`_base_agent.py`). It provides some standard setup:
243: 
244: ```python
245: # From: _base_agent.py (Simplified)
246: class BaseAgent(ABC, Agent):
247:     def __init__(self, description: str) -> None:
248:         # Gets runtime & id from a special context when created by the runtime
249:         # Raises error if you try to create it directly!
250:         self._runtime: AgentRuntime = AgentInstantiationContext.current_runtime()
251:         self._id: AgentId = AgentInstantiationContext.current_agent_id()
252:         self._description = description
253:         # ...
254: 
255:     # This is the final version called by the runtime
256:     @final
257:     async def on_message(self, message: Any, ctx: MessageContext) -> Any:
258:         # It calls the implementation method you need to write
259:         return await self.on_message_impl(message, ctx)
260: 
261:     # You MUST implement this in your subclass
262:     @abstractmethod
263:     async def on_message_impl(self, message: Any, ctx: MessageContext) -> Any: ...
264: 
265:     # Helper to send messages easily
266:     async def send_message(self, message: Any, recipient: AgentId, ...) -> Any:
267:         # It just asks the runtime to do the actual sending
268:         return await self._runtime.send_message(
269:             message, sender=self.id, recipient=recipient, ...
270:         )
271:     # ... other methods like publish_message, save_state, load_state
272: ```
273: Notice how `BaseAgent` handles getting its `id` and `runtime` during creation and provides a convenient `send_message` method that uses the runtime. When inheriting from `BaseAgent`, you primarily focus on implementing the `on_message_impl` method to define your agent's unique behavior.
274: 
275: ## Next Steps
276: 
277: You now understand the core concept of an `Agent` in AutoGen Core! It's the fundamental worker unit with an identity, the ability to process messages, and optionally maintain state.
278: 
279: In the next chapters, we'll explore:
280: 
281: *   [Chapter 2: Messaging System](02_messaging_system__topic___subscription_.md): How messages actually travel between agents.
282: *   [Chapter 3: AgentRuntime](03_agentruntime.md): The manager responsible for creating, running, and connecting agents.
283: 
284: Let's continue building your understanding!

  8: # Chapter 2: Messaging System (Topic & Subscription)
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: Agent](01_agent.md), we learned about Agents as individual workers. But how do they coordinate when one agent doesn't know exactly *who* needs the information it produces? Imagine our Researcher finds some facts. Maybe the Writer needs them, but maybe a Fact-Checker agent or a Summary agent also needs them later. How can the Researcher just announce "Here are the facts!" without needing a specific mailing list?
 11: 
 12: This is where the **Messaging System**, specifically **Topics** and **Subscriptions**, comes in. It allows agents to broadcast messages to anyone interested, like posting on a company announcement board.
 13: 
 14: ## Motivation: Broadcasting Information
 15: 
 16: Let's refine our blog post example:
 17: 
 18: 1.  The `Researcher` agent finds facts about "AutoGen Agents".
 19: 2.  Instead of sending *directly* to the `Writer`, the `Researcher` **publishes** these facts to a general "research-results" **Topic**.
 20: 3.  The `Writer` agent has previously told the system it's **subscribed** to the "research-results" Topic.
 21: 4.  The system sees the new message on the Topic and delivers it to the `Writer` (and any other subscribers).
 22: 
 23: This way, the `Researcher` doesn't need to know who the `Writer` is, or even if a `Writer` exists! It just broadcasts the results. If we later add a `FactChecker` agent that also needs the results, it simply subscribes to the same Topic.
 24: 
 25: ## Key Concepts: Topics and Subscriptions
 26: 
 27: Let's break down the components of this broadcasting system:
 28: 
 29: 1.  **Topic (`TopicId`): The Announcement Board**
 30:     *   A `TopicId` represents a specific channel or category for messages. Think of it like the name of an announcement board (e.g., "Project Updates", "General Announcements").
 31:     *   It has two main parts:
 32:         *   `type`: What *kind* of event or information is this? (e.g., "research.completed", "user.request"). This helps categorize messages.
 33:         *   `source`: *Where* or *why* did this event originate? Often, this relates to the specific task or context (e.g., the specific blog post being researched like "autogen-agents-blog-post", or the team generating the event like "research-team").
 34: 
 35:     ```python
 36:     # From: _topic.py (Simplified)
 37:     from dataclasses import dataclass
 38: 
 39:     @dataclass(frozen=True) # Immutable: can't change after creation
 40:     class TopicId:
 41:         type: str
 42:         source: str
 43: 
 44:         def __str__(self) -> str:
 45:             # Creates an id like "research.completed/autogen-agents-blog-post"
 46:             return f"{self.type}/{self.source}"
 47:     ```
 48:     This structure allows for flexible filtering. Agents might subscribe to all topics of a certain `type`, regardless of the `source`, or only to topics with a specific `source`.
 49: 
 50: 2.  **Publishing: Posting the Announcement**
 51:     *   When an agent has information to share broadly, it *publishes* a message to a specific `TopicId`.
 52:     *   This is like pinning a note to the designated announcement board. The agent doesn't need to know who will read it.
 53: 
 54: 3.  **Subscription (`Subscription`): Signing Up for Updates**
 55:     *   A `Subscription` is how an agent declares its interest in certain `TopicId`s.
 56:     *   It acts like a rule: "If a message is published to a Topic that matches *this pattern*, please deliver it to *this kind of agent*".
 57:     *   The `Subscription` links a `TopicId` pattern (e.g., "all topics with type `research.completed`") to an `AgentId` (or a way to determine the `AgentId`).
 58: 
 59: 4.  **Routing: Delivering the Mail**
 60:     *   The `AgentRuntime` (the system manager we'll meet in [Chapter 3: AgentRuntime](03_agentruntime.md)) keeps track of all active `Subscription`s.
 61:     *   When a message is published to a `TopicId`, the `AgentRuntime` checks which `Subscription`s match that `TopicId`.
 62:     *   For each match, it uses the `Subscription`'s rule to figure out which specific `AgentId` should receive the message and delivers it.
 63: 
 64: ## Use Case Example: Researcher Publishes, Writer Subscribes
 65: 
 66: Let's see how our Researcher and Writer can use this system.
 67: 
 68: **Goal:** Researcher publishes facts to a topic, Writer receives them via subscription.
 69: 
 70: **1. Define the Topic:**
 71: We need a `TopicId` for research results. Let's say the `type` is "research.facts.available" and the `source` identifies the specific research task (e.g., "blog-post-autogen").
 72: 
 73: ```python
 74: # From: _topic.py
 75: from autogen_core import TopicId
 76: 
 77: # Define the topic for this specific research task
 78: research_topic_id = TopicId(type="research.facts.available", source="blog-post-autogen")
 79: 
 80: print(f"Topic ID: {research_topic_id}")
 81: # Output: Topic ID: research.facts.available/blog-post-autogen
 82: ```
 83: This defines the "announcement board" we'll use.
 84: 
 85: **2. Researcher Publishes:**
 86: The `Researcher` agent, after finding facts, will use its `agent_context` (provided by the runtime) to publish the `ResearchFacts` message to this topic.
 87: 
 88: ```python
 89: # Simplified concept - Researcher agent logic
 90: # Assume 'agent_context' and 'message' (ResearchTopic) are provided
 91: 
 92: # Define the facts message (from Chapter 1)
 93: @dataclass
 94: class ResearchFacts:
 95:     topic: str
 96:     facts: list[str]
 97: 
 98: async def researcher_publish_logic(agent_context, message: ResearchTopic, msg_context):
 99:     print(f"Researcher working on: {message.topic}")
100:     facts_data = ResearchFacts(
101:         topic=message.topic,
102:         facts=[f"Fact A about {message.topic}", f"Fact B about {message.topic}"]
103:     )
104: 
105:     # Define the specific topic for this task's results
106:     results_topic = TopicId(type="research.facts.available", source=message.topic) # Use message topic as source
107: 
108:     # Publish the facts to the topic
109:     await agent_context.publish_message(message=facts_data, topic_id=results_topic)
110:     print(f"Researcher published facts to topic: {results_topic}")
111:     # No direct reply needed
112:     return None
113: ```
114: Notice the `agent_context.publish_message` call. The Researcher doesn't specify a recipient, only the topic.
115: 
116: **3. Writer Subscribes:**
117: The `Writer` agent needs to tell the system it's interested in messages on topics like "research.facts.available". We can use a predefined `Subscription` type called `TypeSubscription`. This subscription typically means: "I am interested in all topics with this *exact type*. When a message arrives, create/use an agent of *my type* whose `key` matches the topic's `source`."
118: 
119: ```python
120: # From: _type_subscription.py (Simplified Concept)
121: from autogen_core import TypeSubscription, BaseAgent
122: 
123: class WriterAgent(BaseAgent):
124:     # ... agent implementation ...
125:     async def on_message_impl(self, message: ResearchFacts, ctx):
126:         # This method gets called when a subscribed message arrives
127:         print(f"Writer ({self.id}) received facts via subscription: {message.facts}")
128:         # ... process facts and write draft ...
129: 
130: # How the Writer subscribes (usually done during runtime setup - Chapter 3)
131: # This tells the runtime: "Messages on topics with type 'research.facts.available'
132: # should go to a 'writer' agent whose key matches the topic source."
133: writer_subscription = TypeSubscription(
134:     topic_type="research.facts.available",
135:     agent_type="writer" # The type of agent that should handle this
136: )
137: 
138: print(f"Writer subscription created for topic type: {writer_subscription.topic_type}")
139: # Output: Writer subscription created for topic type: research.facts.available
140: ```
141: When the `Researcher` publishes to `TopicId(type="research.facts.available", source="blog-post-autogen")`, the `AgentRuntime` will see that `writer_subscription` matches the `topic_type`. It will then use the rule: "Find (or create) an agent with `AgentId(type='writer', key='blog-post-autogen')` and deliver the message."
142: 
143: **Benefit:** Decoupling! The Researcher just broadcasts. The Writer just listens for relevant broadcasts. We can add more listeners (like a `FactChecker` subscribing to the same `topic_type`) without changing the `Researcher` at all.
144: 
145: ## Under the Hood: How Publishing Works
146: 
147: Let's trace the journey of a published message.
148: 
149: **Conceptual Flow:**
150: 
151: ```mermaid
152: sequenceDiagram
153:     participant Publisher as Publisher Agent
154:     participant Runtime as AgentRuntime
155:     participant SubRegistry as Subscription Registry
156:     participant Subscriber as Subscriber Agent
157: 
158:     Publisher->>+Runtime: publish_message(message, topic_id)
159:     Runtime->>+SubRegistry: Find subscriptions matching topic_id
160:     SubRegistry-->>-Runtime: Return list of matching Subscriptions
161:     loop For each matching Subscription
162:         Runtime->>Subscription: map_to_agent(topic_id)
163:         Subscription-->>Runtime: Return target AgentId
164:         Runtime->>+Subscriber: Locate/Create Agent instance by AgentId
165:         Runtime->>Subscriber: on_message(message, context)
166:         Subscriber-->>-Runtime: Process message (optional return)
167:     end
168:     Runtime-->>-Publisher: Return (usually None for publish)
169: ```
170: 
171: 1.  **Publish:** An agent calls `agent_context.publish_message(message, topic_id)`. This internally calls the `AgentRuntime`'s publish method.
172: 2.  **Lookup:** The `AgentRuntime` takes the `topic_id` and consults its internal `Subscription Registry`.
173: 3.  **Match:** The Registry checks all registered `Subscription` objects. Each `Subscription` has an `is_match(topic_id)` method. The registry finds all subscriptions where `is_match` returns `True`.
174: 4.  **Map:** For each matching `Subscription`, the Runtime calls its `map_to_agent(topic_id)` method. This method returns the specific `AgentId` that should handle this message based on the subscription rule and the topic details.
175: 5.  **Deliver:** The `AgentRuntime` finds the agent instance corresponding to the returned `AgentId` (potentially creating it if it doesn't exist yet, especially with `TypeSubscription`). It then calls that agent's `on_message` method, delivering the original published `message`.
176: 
177: **Code Glimpse:**
178: 
179: *   **`TopicId` (`_topic.py`):** As shown before, a simple dataclass holding `type` and `source`. It includes validation to ensure the `type` follows certain naming conventions.
180: 
181:     ```python
182:     # From: _topic.py
183:     @dataclass(eq=True, frozen=True)
184:     class TopicId:
185:         type: str
186:         source: str
187:         # ... validation and __str__ ...
188: 
189:         @classmethod
190:         def from_str(cls, topic_id: str) -> Self:
191:             # Helper to parse "type/source" string
192:             # ... implementation ...
193:     ```
194: 
195: *   **`Subscription` Protocol (`_subscription.py`):** This defines the *contract* for any subscription rule.
196: 
197:     ```python
198:     # From: _subscription.py (Simplified Protocol)
199:     from typing import Protocol
200:     # ... other imports
201: 
202:     class Subscription(Protocol):
203:         @property
204:         def id(self) -> str: ... # Unique ID for this subscription instance
205: 
206:         def is_match(self, topic_id: TopicId) -> bool:
207:             """Check if a topic matches this subscription's rule."""
208:             ...
209: 
210:         def map_to_agent(self, topic_id: TopicId) -> AgentId:
211:             """Determine the target AgentId if is_match was True."""
212:             ...
213:     ```
214:     Any class implementing these methods can act as a subscription rule.
215: 
216: *   **`TypeSubscription` (`_type_subscription.py`):** A common implementation of the `Subscription` protocol.
217: 
218:     ```python
219:     # From: _type_subscription.py (Simplified)
220:     class TypeSubscription(Subscription):
221:         def __init__(self, topic_type: str, agent_type: str, ...):
222:             self._topic_type = topic_type
223:             self._agent_type = agent_type
224:             # ... generates a unique self._id ...
225: 
226:         def is_match(self, topic_id: TopicId) -> bool:
227:             # Matches if the topic's type is exactly the one we want
228:             return topic_id.type == self._topic_type
229: 
230:         def map_to_agent(self, topic_id: TopicId) -> AgentId:
231:             # Maps to an agent of the specified type, using the
232:             # topic's source as the agent's unique key.
233:             if not self.is_match(topic_id):
234:                  raise CantHandleException(...) # Should not happen if used correctly
235:             return AgentId(type=self._agent_type, key=topic_id.source)
236:         # ... id property ...
237:     ```
238:     This implementation provides the "one agent instance per source" behavior for a specific topic type.
239: 
240: *   **`DefaultSubscription` (`_default_subscription.py`):** This is often used via a decorator (`@default_subscription`) and provides a convenient way to create a `TypeSubscription` where the `agent_type` is automatically inferred from the agent class being defined, and the `topic_type` defaults to "default" (but can be overridden). It simplifies common use cases.
241: 
242:     ```python
243:     # From: _default_subscription.py (Conceptual Usage)
244:     from autogen_core import BaseAgent, default_subscription, ResearchFacts
245: 
246:     @default_subscription # Uses 'default' topic type, infers agent type 'writer'
247:     class WriterAgent(BaseAgent):
248:         # Agent logic here...
249:         async def on_message_impl(self, message: ResearchFacts, ctx): ...
250: 
251:     # Or specify the topic type
252:     @default_subscription(topic_type="research.facts.available")
253:     class SpecificWriterAgent(BaseAgent):
254:          # Agent logic here...
255:          async def on_message_impl(self, message: ResearchFacts, ctx): ...
256:     ```
257: 
258: The actual sending (`publish_message`) and routing logic reside within the `AgentRuntime`, which we'll explore next.
259: 
260: ## Next Steps
261: 
262: You've learned how AutoGen Core uses a publish/subscribe system (`TopicId`, `Subscription`) to allow agents to communicate without direct coupling. This is crucial for building flexible and scalable multi-agent applications.
263: 
264: *   **Topic (`TopicId`):** Named channels (`type`/`source`) for broadcasting messages.
265: *   **Publish:** Sending a message to a Topic.
266: *   **Subscription:** An agent's declared interest in messages on certain Topics, defining a routing rule.
267: 
268: Now, let's dive into the orchestrator that manages agents and makes this messaging system work:
269: 
270: *   [Chapter 3: AgentRuntime](03_agentruntime.md): The manager responsible for creating, running, and connecting agents, including handling message publishing and subscription routing.

  8: # Chapter 3: AgentRuntime - The Office Manager
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: Agent](01_agent.md), we met the workers (`Agent`) of our system. In [Chapter 2: Messaging System](02_messaging_system__topic___subscription_.md), we saw how they can communicate broadly using topics and subscriptions. But who hires these agents? Who actually delivers the messages, whether direct or published? And who keeps the whole system running smoothly?
 11: 
 12: This is where the **`AgentRuntime`** comes in. It's the central nervous system, the operating system, or perhaps the most fitting analogy: **the office manager** for all your agents.
 13: 
 14: ## Motivation: Why Do We Need an Office Manager?
 15: 
 16: Imagine an office full of employees (Agents). You have researchers, writers, maybe coders.
 17: *   How does a new employee get hired and set up?
 18: *   When one employee wants to send a memo directly to another, who makes sure it gets to the right desk?
 19: *   When someone posts an announcement on the company bulletin board (publishes to a topic), who ensures everyone who signed up for that type of announcement sees it?
 20: *   Who starts the workday and ensures everything keeps running?
 21: 
 22: Without an office manager, it would be chaos! The `AgentRuntime` serves this crucial role in AutoGen Core. It handles:
 23: 
 24: 1.  **Agent Creation:** "Onboarding" new agents when they are needed.
 25: 2.  **Message Routing:** Delivering direct messages (`send_message`) and published messages (`publish_message`).
 26: 3.  **Lifecycle Management:** Starting, running, and stopping the whole system.
 27: 4.  **State Management:** Keeping track of the overall system state (optional).
 28: 
 29: ## Key Concepts: Understanding the Manager's Job
 30: 
 31: Let's break down the main responsibilities of the `AgentRuntime`:
 32: 
 33: 1.  **Agent Instantiation (Hiring):**
 34:     *   You don't usually create agent objects directly (like `my_agent = ResearcherAgent()`). Why? Because the agent needs to know *about* the runtime (the office it works in) to send messages, publish announcements, etc.
 35:     *   Instead, you tell the `AgentRuntime`: "I need an agent of type 'researcher'. Here's a recipe (a **factory function**) for how to create one." This is done using `runtime.register_factory(...)`.
 36:     *   When a message needs to go to a 'researcher' agent with a specific key (e.g., 'researcher-01'), the runtime checks if it already exists. If not, it uses the registered factory function to create (instantiate) the agent.
 37:     *   **Crucially**, while creating the agent, the runtime provides special context (`AgentInstantiationContext`) so the new agent automatically gets its unique `AgentId` and a reference to the `AgentRuntime` itself. This is like giving a new employee their ID badge and telling them who the office manager is.
 38: 
 39:     ```python
 40:     # Simplified Concept - How a BaseAgent gets its ID and runtime access
 41:     # From: _agent_instantiation.py and _base_agent.py
 42: 
 43:     # Inside the agent's __init__ method (when inheriting from BaseAgent):
 44:     class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
 45:         def __init__(self, description: str):
 46:             # This magic happens *because* the AgentRuntime is creating the agent
 47:             # inside a special context.
 48:             self._runtime = AgentInstantiationContext.current_runtime() # Gets the manager
 49:             self._id = AgentInstantiationContext.current_agent_id()     # Gets its own ID
 50:             self._description = description
 51:             # ... rest of initialization ...
 52:     ```
 53:     This ensures agents are properly integrated into the system from the moment they are created.
 54: 
 55: 2.  **Message Delivery (Mail Room):**
 56:     *   **Direct Send (`send_message`):** When an agent calls `await agent_context.send_message(message, recipient_id)`, it's actually telling the `AgentRuntime`, "Please deliver this `message` directly to the agent identified by `recipient_id`." The runtime finds the recipient agent (creating it if necessary) and calls its `on_message` method. It's like putting a specific name on an envelope and handing it to the mail room.
 57:     *   **Publish (`publish_message`):** When an agent calls `await agent_context.publish_message(message, topic_id)`, it tells the runtime, "Post this `message` to the announcement board named `topic_id`." The runtime then checks its list of **subscriptions** (who signed up for which boards). For every matching subscription, it figures out the correct recipient agent(s) (based on the subscription rule) and delivers the message to their `on_message` method.
 58: 
 59: 3.  **Lifecycle Management (Opening/Closing the Office):**
 60:     *   The runtime needs to be started to begin processing messages. Typically, you call `runtime.start()`. This usually kicks off a background process or loop that watches for incoming messages.
 61:     *   When work is done, you need to stop the runtime gracefully. `runtime.stop_when_idle()` is common – it waits until all messages currently in the queue have been processed, then stops. `runtime.stop()` stops more abruptly.
 62: 
 63: 4.  **State Management (Office Records):**
 64:     *   The runtime can save the state of *all* the agents it manages (`runtime.save_state()`) and load it back later (`runtime.load_state()`). This is useful for pausing and resuming complex multi-agent interactions. It can also save/load state for individual agents (`runtime.agent_save_state()` / `runtime.agent_load_state()`). We'll touch more on state in [Chapter 7: Memory](07_memory.md).
 65: 
 66: ## Use Case Example: Running Our Researcher and Writer
 67: 
 68: Let's finally run the Researcher/Writer scenario from Chapters 1 and 2. We need the `AgentRuntime` to make it happen.
 69: 
 70: **Goal:**
 71: 1. Create a runtime.
 72: 2. Register factories for a 'researcher' and a 'writer' agent.
 73: 3. Tell the runtime that 'writer' agents are interested in "research.facts.available" topics (add subscription).
 74: 4. Start the runtime.
 75: 5. Send an initial `ResearchTopic` message to a 'researcher' agent.
 76: 6. Let the system run (Researcher publishes facts, Runtime delivers to Writer via subscription, Writer processes).
 77: 7. Stop the runtime when idle.
 78: 
 79: **Code Snippets (Simplified):**
 80: 
 81: ```python
 82: # 0. Imports and Message Definitions (from previous chapters)
 83: import asyncio
 84: from dataclasses import dataclass
 85: from autogen_core import (
 86:     AgentId, BaseAgent, SingleThreadedAgentRuntime, TopicId,
 87:     MessageContext, TypeSubscription, AgentInstantiationContext
 88: )
 89: 
 90: @dataclass
 91: class ResearchTopic: topic: str
 92: @dataclass
 93: class ResearchFacts: topic: str; facts: list[str]
 94: ```
 95: These are the messages our agents will exchange.
 96: 
 97: ```python
 98: # 1. Define Agent Logic (using BaseAgent)
 99: 
100: class ResearcherAgent(BaseAgent):
101:     async def on_message_impl(self, message: ResearchTopic, ctx: MessageContext):
102:         print(f"Researcher ({self.id}) got topic: {message.topic}")
103:         facts = [f"Fact 1 about {message.topic}", f"Fact 2"]
104:         results_topic = TopicId("research.facts.available", message.topic)
105:         # Use the runtime (via self.publish_message helper) to publish
106:         await self.publish_message(
107:             ResearchFacts(topic=message.topic, facts=facts), results_topic
108:         )
109:         print(f"Researcher ({self.id}) published facts to {results_topic}")
110: 
111: class WriterAgent(BaseAgent):
112:     async def on_message_impl(self, message: ResearchFacts, ctx: MessageContext):
113:         print(f"Writer ({self.id}) received facts via topic '{ctx.topic_id}': {message.facts}")
114:         draft = f"Draft for {message.topic}: {'; '.join(message.facts)}"
115:         print(f"Writer ({self.id}) created draft: '{draft}'")
116:         # This agent doesn't send further messages in this example
117: ```
118: Here we define the behavior of our two agent types, inheriting from `BaseAgent` which gives us `self.id`, `self.publish_message`, etc.
119: 
120: ```python
121: # 2. Define Agent Factories
122: 
123: def researcher_factory():
124:     # Gets runtime/id via AgentInstantiationContext inside BaseAgent.__init__
125:     print("Runtime is creating a ResearcherAgent...")
126:     return ResearcherAgent(description="I research topics.")
127: 
128: def writer_factory():
129:     print("Runtime is creating a WriterAgent...")
130:     return WriterAgent(description="I write drafts from facts.")
131: ```
132: These simple functions tell the runtime *how* to create instances of our agents when needed.
133: 
134: ```python
135: # 3. Setup and Run the Runtime
136: 
137: async def main():
138:     # Create the runtime (the office manager)
139:     runtime = SingleThreadedAgentRuntime()
140: 
141:     # Register the factories (tell the manager how to hire)
142:     await runtime.register_factory("researcher", researcher_factory)
143:     await runtime.register_factory("writer", writer_factory)
144:     print("Registered agent factories.")
145: 
146:     # Add the subscription (tell manager who listens to which announcements)
147:     # Rule: Messages to topics of type "research.facts.available"
148:     # should go to a "writer" agent whose key matches the topic source.
149:     writer_sub = TypeSubscription(topic_type="research.facts.available", agent_type="writer")
150:     await runtime.add_subscription(writer_sub)
151:     print(f"Added subscription: {writer_sub.id}")
152: 
153:     # Start the runtime (open the office)
154:     runtime.start()
155:     print("Runtime started.")
156: 
157:     # Send the initial message to kick things off
158:     research_task_topic = "AutoGen Agents"
159:     researcher_instance_id = AgentId(type="researcher", key=research_task_topic)
160:     print(f"Sending initial topic '{research_task_topic}' to {researcher_instance_id}")
161:     await runtime.send_message(
162:         message=ResearchTopic(topic=research_task_topic),
163:         recipient=researcher_instance_id,
164:     )
165: 
166:     # Wait until all messages are processed (wait for work day to end)
167:     print("Waiting for runtime to become idle...")
168:     await runtime.stop_when_idle()
169:     print("Runtime stopped.")
170: 
171: # Run the main function
172: asyncio.run(main())
173: ```
174: This script sets up the `SingleThreadedAgentRuntime`, registers the blueprints (factories) and communication rules (subscription), starts the process, and then shuts down cleanly.
175: 
176: **Expected Output (Conceptual Order):**
177: 
178: ```
179: Registered agent factories.
180: Added subscription: type=research.facts.available=>agent=writer
181: Runtime started.
182: Sending initial topic 'AutoGen Agents' to researcher/AutoGen Agents
183: Waiting for runtime to become idle...
184: Runtime is creating a ResearcherAgent...  # First time researcher/AutoGen Agents is needed
185: Researcher (researcher/AutoGen Agents) got topic: AutoGen Agents
186: Researcher (researcher/AutoGen Agents) published facts to research.facts.available/AutoGen Agents
187: Runtime is creating a WriterAgent...      # First time writer/AutoGen Agents is needed (due to subscription)
188: Writer (writer/AutoGen Agents) received facts via topic 'research.facts.available/AutoGen Agents': ['Fact 1 about AutoGen Agents', 'Fact 2']
189: Writer (writer/AutoGen Agents) created draft: 'Draft for AutoGen Agents: Fact 1 about AutoGen Agents; Fact 2'
190: Runtime stopped.
191: ```
192: You can see the runtime orchestrating the creation of agents and the flow of messages based on the initial request and the subscription rule.
193: 
194: ## Under the Hood: How the Manager Works
195: 
196: Let's peek inside the `SingleThreadedAgentRuntime` (a common implementation provided by AutoGen Core) to understand the flow.
197: 
198: **Core Idea:** It uses an internal queue (`_message_queue`) to hold incoming requests (`send_message`, `publish_message`). A background task continuously takes items from the queue and processes them one by one (though the *handling* of a message might involve `await` and allow other tasks to run).
199: 
200: **1. Agent Creation (`_get_agent`, `_invoke_agent_factory`)**
201: 
202: When the runtime needs an agent instance (e.g., to deliver a message) that hasn't been created yet:
203: 
204: ```mermaid
205: sequenceDiagram
206:     participant Runtime as AgentRuntime
207:     participant Factory as Agent Factory Func
208:     participant AgentCtx as AgentInstantiationContext
209:     participant Agent as New Agent Instance
210: 
211:     Runtime->>Runtime: Check if agent instance exists (e.g., in `_instantiated_agents` dict)
212:     alt Agent Not Found
213:         Runtime->>Runtime: Find registered factory for agent type
214:         Runtime->>AgentCtx: Set current runtime & agent_id
215:         activate AgentCtx
216:         Runtime->>Factory: Call factory function()
217:         activate Factory
218:         Factory->>AgentCtx: (Inside Agent.__init__) Get current runtime
219:         AgentCtx-->>Factory: Return runtime
220:         Factory->>AgentCtx: (Inside Agent.__init__) Get current agent_id
221:         AgentCtx-->>Factory: Return agent_id
222:         Factory-->>Runtime: Return new Agent instance
223:         deactivate Factory
224:         Runtime->>AgentCtx: Clear context
225:         deactivate AgentCtx
226:         Runtime->>Runtime: Store new agent instance
227:     end
228:     Runtime->>Runtime: Return agent instance
229: ```
230: 
231: *   The runtime looks up the factory function registered for the required `AgentId.type`.
232: *   It uses `AgentInstantiationContext.populate_context` to temporarily store its own reference and the target `AgentId`.
233: *   It calls the factory function.
234: *   Inside the agent's `__init__` (usually via `BaseAgent`), `AgentInstantiationContext.current_runtime()` and `AgentInstantiationContext.current_agent_id()` are called to retrieve the context set by the runtime.
235: *   The factory returns the fully initialized agent instance.
236: *   The runtime stores this instance for future use.
237: 
238: ```python
239: # From: _agent_instantiation.py (Simplified)
240: class AgentInstantiationContext:
241:     _CONTEXT_VAR = ContextVar("agent_context") # Stores (runtime, agent_id)
242: 
243:     @classmethod
244:     @contextmanager
245:     def populate_context(cls, ctx: tuple[AgentRuntime, AgentId]):
246:         token = cls._CONTEXT_VAR.set(ctx) # Store context for this block
247:         try:
248:             yield # Code inside the 'with' block runs here
249:         finally:
250:             cls._CONTEXT_VAR.reset(token) # Clean up context
251: 
252:     @classmethod
253:     def current_runtime(cls) -> AgentRuntime:
254:         return cls._CONTEXT_VAR.get()[0] # Retrieve runtime from context
255: 
256:     @classmethod
257:     def current_agent_id(cls) -> AgentId:
258:         return cls._CONTEXT_VAR.get()[1] # Retrieve agent_id from context
259: ```
260: This context manager pattern ensures the correct runtime and ID are available *only* during the agent's creation by the runtime.
261: 
262: **2. Direct Messaging (`send_message` -> `_process_send`)**
263: 
264: ```mermaid
265: sequenceDiagram
266:     participant Sender as Sending Agent/Code
267:     participant Runtime as AgentRuntime
268:     participant Queue as Internal Queue
269:     participant Recipient as Recipient Agent
270: 
271:     Sender->>+Runtime: send_message(msg, recipient_id, ...)
272:     Runtime->>Runtime: Create Future (for response)
273:     Runtime->>+Queue: Put SendMessageEnvelope(msg, recipient_id, future)
274:     Runtime-->>-Sender: Return awaitable Future
275:     Note over Queue, Runtime: Background task picks up envelope
276:     Runtime->>Runtime: _process_send(envelope)
277:     Runtime->>+Recipient: _get_agent(recipient_id) (creates if needed)
278:     Recipient-->>-Runtime: Return Agent instance
279:     Runtime->>+Recipient: on_message(msg, context)
280:     Recipient->>Recipient: Process message...
281:     Recipient-->>-Runtime: Return response value
282:     Runtime->>Runtime: Set Future result with response value
283: ```
284: 
285: *   `send_message` creates a `Future` object (a placeholder for the eventual result) and wraps the message details in a `SendMessageEnvelope`.
286: *   This envelope is put onto the internal `_message_queue`.
287: *   The background task picks up the envelope.
288: *   `_process_send` gets the recipient agent instance (using `_get_agent`).
289: *   It calls the recipient's `on_message` method.
290: *   When `on_message` returns a result, `_process_send` sets the result on the `Future` object, which makes the original `await runtime.send_message(...)` call return the value.
291: 
292: **3. Publish/Subscribe (`publish_message` -> `_process_publish`)**
293: 
294: ```mermaid
295: sequenceDiagram
296:     participant Publisher as Publishing Agent/Code
297:     participant Runtime as AgentRuntime
298:     participant Queue as Internal Queue
299:     participant SubManager as SubscriptionManager
300:     participant Subscriber as Subscribed Agent
301: 
302:     Publisher->>+Runtime: publish_message(msg, topic_id, ...)
303:     Runtime->>+Queue: Put PublishMessageEnvelope(msg, topic_id)
304:     Runtime-->>-Publisher: Return (None for publish)
305:     Note over Queue, Runtime: Background task picks up envelope
306:     Runtime->>Runtime: _process_publish(envelope)
307:     Runtime->>+SubManager: get_subscribed_recipients(topic_id)
308:     SubManager->>SubManager: Find matching subscriptions
309:     SubManager->>SubManager: Map subscriptions to AgentIds
310:     SubManager-->>-Runtime: Return list of recipient AgentIds
311:     loop For each recipient AgentId
312:         Runtime->>+Subscriber: _get_agent(recipient_id) (creates if needed)
313:         Subscriber-->>-Runtime: Return Agent instance
314:         Runtime->>+Subscriber: on_message(msg, context with topic_id)
315:         Subscriber->>Subscriber: Process message...
316:         Subscriber-->>-Runtime: Return (usually None for publish)
317:     end
318: ```
319: 
320: *   `publish_message` wraps the message in a `PublishMessageEnvelope` and puts it on the queue.
321: *   The background task picks it up.
322: *   `_process_publish` asks the `SubscriptionManager` (`_subscription_manager`) for all `AgentId`s that are subscribed to the given `topic_id`.
323: *   The `SubscriptionManager` checks its registered `Subscription` objects (`_subscriptions` list, added via `add_subscription`). For each `Subscription` where `is_match(topic_id)` is true, it calls `map_to_agent(topic_id)` to get the target `AgentId`.
324: *   For each resulting `AgentId`, the runtime gets the agent instance and calls its `on_message` method, providing the `topic_id` in the `MessageContext`.
325: 
326: ```python
327: # From: _runtime_impl_helpers.py (SubscriptionManager simplified)
328: class SubscriptionManager:
329:     def __init__(self):
330:         self._subscriptions: List[Subscription] = []
331:         # Optimization cache can be added here
332: 
333:     async def add_subscription(self, subscription: Subscription):
334:         self._subscriptions.append(subscription)
335:         # Clear cache if any
336: 
337:     async def get_subscribed_recipients(self, topic: TopicId) -> List[AgentId]:
338:         recipients = []
339:         for sub in self._subscriptions:
340:             if sub.is_match(topic):
341:                 recipients.append(sub.map_to_agent(topic))
342:         return recipients
343: ```
344: The `SubscriptionManager` simply iterates through registered subscriptions to find matches when a message is published.
345: 
346: ## Next Steps
347: 
348: You now understand the `AgentRuntime` - the essential coordinator that brings Agents to life, manages their communication, and runs the entire show. It handles agent creation via factories, routes direct and published messages, and manages the system's lifecycle.
349: 
350: With the core concepts of `Agent`, `Messaging`, and `AgentRuntime` covered, we can start looking at more specialized building blocks. Next, we'll explore how agents can use external capabilities:
351: 
352: *   [Chapter 4: Tool](04_tool.md): How to give agents tools (like functions or APIs) to perform specific actions beyond just processing messages.

  8: # Chapter 4: Tool - Giving Agents Specific Capabilities
  9: 
 10: In the previous chapters, we learned about Agents as workers ([Chapter 1](01_agent.md)), how they can communicate directly or using announcements ([Chapter 2](02_messaging_system__topic___subscription_.md)), and the `AgentRuntime` that manages them ([Chapter 3](03_agentruntime.md)).
 11: 
 12: Agents can process messages and coordinate, but what if an agent needs to perform a very specific action, like looking up information online, running a piece of code, accessing a database, or even just finding out the current date? They need specialized *capabilities*.
 13: 
 14: This is where the concept of a **Tool** comes in.
 15: 
 16: ## Motivation: Agents Need Skills!
 17: 
 18: Imagine our `Writer` agent from before. It receives facts and writes a draft. Now, let's say we want the `Writer` (or perhaps a smarter `Assistant` agent helping it) to always include the current date in the blog post title.
 19: 
 20: How does the agent get the current date? It doesn't inherently know it. It needs a specific *skill* or *tool* for that.
 21: 
 22: A `Tool` in AutoGen Core represents exactly this: a specific, well-defined capability that an Agent can use. Think of it like giving an employee (Agent) a specialized piece of equipment (Tool), like a calculator, a web browser, or a calendar lookup program.
 23: 
 24: ## Key Concepts: Understanding Tools
 25: 
 26: Let's break down what defines a Tool:
 27: 
 28: 1.  **It's a Specific Capability:** A Tool performs one well-defined task. Examples:
 29:     *   `search_web(query: str)`
 30:     *   `run_python_code(code: str)`
 31:     *   `get_stock_price(ticker: str)`
 32:     *   `get_current_date()`
 33: 
 34: 2.  **It Has a Schema (The Manual):** This is crucial! For an Agent (especially one powered by a Large Language Model - LLM) to know *when* and *how* to use a tool, the tool needs a clear description or "manual". This is called the `ToolSchema`. It typically includes:
 35:     *   **`name`**: A unique identifier for the tool (e.g., `get_current_date`).
 36:     *   **`description`**: A clear explanation of what the tool does, which helps the LLM decide if this tool is appropriate for the current task (e.g., "Fetches the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format").
 37:     *   **`parameters`**: Defines what inputs the tool needs. This is itself a schema (`ParametersSchema`) describing the input fields, their types, and which ones are required. For our `get_current_date` example, it might need no parameters. For `get_stock_price`, it would need a `ticker` parameter of type string.
 38: 
 39:     ```python
 40:     # From: tools/_base.py (Simplified Concept)
 41:     from typing import TypedDict, Dict, Any, Sequence, NotRequired
 42: 
 43:     class ParametersSchema(TypedDict):
 44:         type: str # Usually "object"
 45:         properties: Dict[str, Any] # Defines input fields and their types
 46:         required: NotRequired[Sequence[str]] # List of required field names
 47: 
 48:     class ToolSchema(TypedDict):
 49:         name: str
 50:         description: NotRequired[str]
 51:         parameters: NotRequired[ParametersSchema]
 52:         # 'strict' flag also possible (Chapter 5 related)
 53:     ```
 54:     This schema allows an LLM to understand: "Ah, there's a tool called `get_current_date` that takes no inputs and gives me the current date. I should use that now!"
 55: 
 56: 3.  **It Can Be Executed:** Once an agent decides to use a tool (often based on the schema), there needs to be a mechanism to actually *run* the tool's underlying function and get the result.
 57: 
 58: ## Use Case Example: Adding a `get_current_date` Tool
 59: 
 60: Let's equip an agent with the ability to find the current date.
 61: 
 62: **Goal:** Define a tool that gets the current date and show how it could be executed by a specialized agent.
 63: 
 64: **Step 1: Define the Python Function**
 65: 
 66: First, we need the actual Python code that performs the action.
 67: 
 68: ```python
 69: # File: get_date_function.py
 70: import datetime
 71: 
 72: def get_current_date() -> str:
 73:     """Fetches the current date as a string."""
 74:     today = datetime.date.today()
 75:     return today.isoformat() # Returns date like "2023-10-27"
 76: 
 77: # Test the function
 78: print(f"Function output: {get_current_date()}")
 79: ```
 80: This is a standard Python function. It takes no arguments and returns the date as a string.
 81: 
 82: **Step 2: Wrap it as a `FunctionTool`**
 83: 
 84: AutoGen Core provides a convenient way to turn a Python function like this into a `Tool` object using `FunctionTool`. It automatically inspects the function's signature (arguments and return type) and docstring to help build the `ToolSchema`.
 85: 
 86: ```python
 87: # File: create_date_tool.py
 88: from autogen_core.tools import FunctionTool
 89: from get_date_function import get_current_date # Import our function
 90: 
 91: # Create the Tool instance
 92: # We provide the function and a clear description for the LLM
 93: date_tool = FunctionTool(
 94:     func=get_current_date,
 95:     description="Use this tool to get the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format."
 96:     # Name defaults to function name 'get_current_date'
 97: )
 98: 
 99: # Let's see what FunctionTool generated
100: print(f"Tool Name: {date_tool.name}")
101: print(f"Tool Description: {date_tool.description}")
102: 
103: # The schema defines inputs (none in this case)
104: # print(f"Tool Schema Parameters: {date_tool.schema['parameters']}")
105: # Output (simplified): {'type': 'object', 'properties': {}, 'required': []}
106: ```
107: `FunctionTool` wraps our `get_current_date` function. It uses the function name as the tool name and the description we provided. It also correctly determines from the function signature that there are no input parameters (`properties: {}`).
108: 
109: **Step 3: How an Agent Might Request Tool Use**
110: 
111: Now we have a `date_tool`. How is it used? Typically, an LLM-powered agent (which we'll see more of in [Chapter 5: ChatCompletionClient](05_chatcompletionclient.md)) analyzes a request and decides a tool is needed. It then generates a request to *call* that tool, often using a specific message type like `FunctionCall`.
112: 
113: ```python
114: # File: tool_call_request.py
115: from autogen_core import FunctionCall # Represents a request to call a tool
116: 
117: # Imagine an LLM agent decided to use the date tool.
118: # It constructs this message, providing the tool name and arguments (as JSON string).
119: date_call_request = FunctionCall(
120:     id="call_date_001", # A unique ID for this specific call attempt
121:     name="get_current_date", # Matches the Tool's name
122:     arguments="{}" # An empty JSON object because no arguments are needed
123: )
124: 
125: print("FunctionCall message:", date_call_request)
126: # Output: FunctionCall(id='call_date_001', name='get_current_date', arguments='{}')
127: ```
128: This `FunctionCall` message is like a work order: "Please execute the tool named `get_current_date` with these arguments."
129: 
130: **Step 4: The `ToolAgent` Executes the Tool**
131: 
132: Who receives this `FunctionCall` message? Usually, a specialized agent called `ToolAgent`. You create a `ToolAgent` and give it the list of tools it knows how to execute. When it receives a `FunctionCall`, it finds the matching tool and runs it.
133: 
134: ```python
135: # File: tool_agent_example.py
136: import asyncio
137: from autogen_core.tool_agent import ToolAgent
138: from autogen_core.models import FunctionExecutionResult
139: from create_date_tool import date_tool # Import the tool we created
140: from tool_call_request import date_call_request # Import the request message
141: 
142: # Create an agent specifically designed to execute tools
143: tool_executor = ToolAgent(
144:     description="I can execute tools like getting the date.",
145:     tools=[date_tool] # Give it the list of tools it manages
146: )
147: 
148: # --- Simulation of Runtime delivering the message ---
149: # In a real app, the AgentRuntime (Chapter 3) would route the
150: # date_call_request message to this tool_executor agent.
151: # We simulate the call to its message handler here:
152: 
153: async def simulate_execution():
154:     # Fake context (normally provided by runtime)
155:     class MockContext: cancellation_token = None
156:     ctx = MockContext()
157: 
158:     print(f"ToolAgent received request: {date_call_request.name}")
159:     result: FunctionExecutionResult = await tool_executor.handle_function_call(
160:         message=date_call_request,
161:         ctx=ctx
162:     )
163:     print(f"ToolAgent produced result: {result}")
164: 
165: asyncio.run(simulate_execution())
166: ```
167: 
168: **Expected Output:**
169: 
170: ```
171: ToolAgent received request: get_current_date
172: ToolAgent produced result: FunctionExecutionResult(content='2023-10-27', call_id='call_date_001', is_error=False, name='get_current_date') # Date will be current date
173: ```
174: The `ToolAgent` received the `FunctionCall`, found the `date_tool` in its list, executed the underlying `get_current_date` function, and packaged the result (the date string) into a `FunctionExecutionResult` message. This result message can then be sent back to the agent that originally requested the tool use.
175: 
176: ## Under the Hood: How Tool Execution Works
177: 
178: Let's visualize the typical flow when an LLM agent decides to use a tool managed by a `ToolAgent`.
179: 
180: **Conceptual Flow:**
181: 
182: ```mermaid
183: sequenceDiagram
184:     participant LLMA as LLM Agent (Decides)
185:     participant Caller as Caller Agent (Orchestrates)
186:     participant ToolA as ToolAgent (Executes)
187:     participant ToolFunc as Tool Function (e.g., get_current_date)
188: 
189:     Note over LLMA: Analyzes conversation, decides tool needed.
190:     LLMA->>Caller: Sends AssistantMessage containing FunctionCall(name='get_current_date', args='{}')
191:     Note over Caller: Receives LLM response, sees FunctionCall.
192:     Caller->>+ToolA: Uses runtime.send_message(message=FunctionCall, recipient=ToolAgent_ID)
193:     Note over ToolA: Receives FunctionCall via on_message.
194:     ToolA->>ToolA: Looks up 'get_current_date' in its internal list of Tools.
195:     ToolA->>+ToolFunc: Calls tool.run_json(args={}) -> triggers get_current_date()
196:     ToolFunc-->>-ToolA: Returns the result (e.g., "2023-10-27")
197:     ToolA->>ToolA: Creates FunctionExecutionResult message with the content.
198:     ToolA-->>-Caller: Returns FunctionExecutionResult via runtime messaging.
199:     Note over Caller: Receives the tool result.
200:     Caller->>LLMA: Sends FunctionExecutionResultMessage to LLM for next step.
201:     Note over LLMA: Now knows the current date.
202: ```
203: 
204: 1.  **Decision:** An LLM-powered agent decides a tool is needed based on the conversation and the available tools' descriptions. It generates a `FunctionCall`.
205: 2.  **Request:** A "Caller" agent (often the same LLM agent or a managing agent) sends this `FunctionCall` message to the dedicated `ToolAgent` using the `AgentRuntime`.
206: 3.  **Lookup:** The `ToolAgent` receives the message, extracts the tool `name` (`get_current_date`), and finds the corresponding `Tool` object (our `date_tool`) in the list it was configured with.
207: 4.  **Execution:** The `ToolAgent` calls the `run_json` method on the `Tool` object, passing the arguments from the `FunctionCall`. For a `FunctionTool`, `run_json` validates the arguments against the generated schema and then executes the original Python function (`get_current_date`).
208: 5.  **Result:** The Python function returns its result (the date string).
209: 6.  **Response:** The `ToolAgent` wraps this result string in a `FunctionExecutionResult` message, including the original `call_id`, and sends it back to the Caller agent.
210: 7.  **Continuation:** The Caller agent typically sends this result back to the LLM agent, allowing the conversation or task to continue with the new information.
211: 
212: **Code Glimpse:**
213: 
214: *   **`Tool` Protocol (`tools/_base.py`):** Defines the basic contract any tool must fulfill. Key methods are `schema` (property returning the `ToolSchema`) and `run_json` (method to execute the tool with JSON-like arguments).
215: *   **`BaseTool` (`tools/_base.py`):** An abstract class that helps implement the `Tool` protocol, especially using Pydantic models for defining arguments (`args_type`) and return values (`return_type`). It automatically generates the `parameters` part of the schema from the `args_type` model.
216: *   **`FunctionTool` (`tools/_function_tool.py`):** Inherits from `BaseTool`. Its magic lies in automatically creating the `args_type` Pydantic model by inspecting the wrapped Python function's signature (`args_base_model_from_signature`). Its `run` method handles calling the original sync or async Python function.
217:     ```python
218:     # Inside FunctionTool (Simplified Concept)
219:     class FunctionTool(BaseTool[BaseModel, BaseModel]):
220:         def __init__(self, func, description, ...):
221:             self._func = func
222:             self._signature = get_typed_signature(func)
223:             # Automatically create Pydantic model for arguments
224:             args_model = args_base_model_from_signature(...)
225:             # Get return type from signature
226:             return_type = self._signature.return_annotation
227:             super().__init__(args_model, return_type, ...)
228: 
229:         async def run(self, args: BaseModel, ...):
230:             # Extract arguments from the 'args' model
231:             kwargs = args.model_dump()
232:             # Call the original Python function (sync or async)
233:             result = await self._call_underlying_func(**kwargs)
234:             return result # Must match the expected return_type
235:     ```
236: *   **`ToolAgent` (`tool_agent/_tool_agent.py`):** A specialized `RoutedAgent`. It registers a handler specifically for `FunctionCall` messages.
237:     ```python
238:     # Inside ToolAgent (Simplified Concept)
239:     class ToolAgent(RoutedAgent):
240:         def __init__(self, ..., tools: List[Tool]):
241:             super().__init__(...)
242:             self._tools = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools} # Store tools by name
243: 
244:         @message_handler # Registers this for FunctionCall messages
245:         async def handle_function_call(self, message: FunctionCall, ctx: MessageContext):
246:             # Find the tool by name
247:             tool = self._tools.get(message.name)
248:             if tool is None:
249:                 # Handle error: Tool not found
250:                 raise ToolNotFoundException(...)
251:             try:
252:                 # Parse arguments string into a dictionary
253:                 arguments = json.loads(message.arguments)
254:                 # Execute the tool's run_json method
255:                 result_obj = await tool.run_json(args=arguments, ...)
256:                 # Convert result object back to string if needed
257:                 result_str = tool.return_value_as_string(result_obj)
258:                 # Create the success result message
259:                 return FunctionExecutionResult(content=result_str, ...)
260:             except Exception as e:
261:                 # Handle execution errors
262:                 return FunctionExecutionResult(content=f"Error: {e}", is_error=True, ...)
263:     ```
264:     Its core logic is: find tool -> parse args -> run tool -> return result/error.
265: 
266: ## Next Steps
267: 
268: You've learned how **Tools** provide specific capabilities to Agents, defined by a **Schema** that LLMs can understand. We saw how `FunctionTool` makes it easy to wrap existing Python functions and how `ToolAgent` acts as the executor for these tools.
269: 
270: This ability for agents to use tools is fundamental to building powerful and versatile AI systems that can interact with the real world or perform complex calculations.
271: 
272: Now that agents can use tools, we need to understand more about the agents that *decide* which tools to use, which often involves interacting with Large Language Models:
273: 
274: *   [Chapter 5: ChatCompletionClient](05_chatcompletionclient.md): How agents interact with LLMs like GPT to generate responses or decide on actions (like calling a tool).
275: *   [Chapter 6: ChatCompletionContext](06_chatcompletioncontext.md): How the history of the conversation, including tool calls and results, is managed when talking to an LLM.

  8: # Chapter 5: ChatCompletionClient - Talking to the Brains
  9: 
 10: So far, we've learned about:
 11: *   [Agents](01_agent.md): The workers in our system.
 12: *   [Messaging](02_messaging_system__topic___subscription_.md): How agents communicate broadly.
 13: *   [AgentRuntime](03_agentruntime.md): The manager that runs the show.
 14: *   [Tools](04_tool.md): How agents get specific skills.
 15: 
 16: But how does an agent actually *think* or *generate text*? Many powerful agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) – think of models like GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini – as their "brains". How does an agent in AutoGen Core communicate with these external LLM services?
 17: 
 18: This is where the **`ChatCompletionClient`** comes in. It's the dedicated component for talking to LLMs.
 19: 
 20: ## Motivation: Bridging the Gap to LLMs
 21: 
 22: Imagine you want to build an agent that can summarize long articles.
 23: 1.  You give the agent an article (as a message).
 24: 2.  The agent needs to send this article to an LLM (like GPT-4).
 25: 3.  It also needs to tell the LLM: "Please summarize this."
 26: 4.  The LLM processes the request and generates a summary.
 27: 5.  The agent needs to receive this summary back from the LLM.
 28: 
 29: How does the agent handle the technical details of connecting to the LLM's specific API, formatting the request correctly, sending it over the internet, and understanding the response?
 30: 
 31: The `ChatCompletionClient` solves this! Think of it as the **standard phone line and translator** connecting your agent to the LLM service. You tell the client *what* to say (the conversation history and instructions), and it handles *how* to say it to the specific LLM and translates the LLM's reply back into a standard format.
 32: 
 33: ## Key Concepts: Understanding the LLM Communicator
 34: 
 35: Let's break down the `ChatCompletionClient`:
 36: 
 37: 1.  **LLM Communication Bridge:** It's the primary way AutoGen agents interact with external LLM APIs (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, etc.). It hides the complexity of specific API calls.
 38: 
 39: 2.  **Standard Interface (`create` method):** It defines a common way to send requests and receive responses, regardless of the underlying LLM. The core method is `create`. You give it:
 40:     *   `messages`: A list of messages representing the conversation history so far.
 41:     *   Optional `tools`: A list of tools ([Chapter 4](04_tool.md)) the LLM might be able to use.
 42:     *   Other parameters (like `json_output` hints, `cancellation_token`).
 43: 
 44: 3.  **Messages (`LLMMessage`):** The conversation history is passed as a sequence of specific message types defined in `autogen_core.models`:
 45:     *   `SystemMessage`: Instructions for the LLM (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant.").
 46:     *   `UserMessage`: Input from the user or another agent (e.g., the article text).
 47:     *   `AssistantMessage`: Previous responses from the LLM (can include text or requests to call functions/tools).
 48:     *   `FunctionExecutionResultMessage`: The results of executing a tool/function call.
 49: 
 50: 4.  **Tools (`ToolSchema`):** You can provide the schemas of available tools ([Chapter 4](04_tool.md)). The LLM might then respond not with text, but with a request to call one of these tools (`FunctionCall` inside an `AssistantMessage`).
 51: 
 52: 5.  **Response (`CreateResult`):** The `create` method returns a standard `CreateResult` object containing:
 53:     *   `content`: The LLM's generated text or a list of `FunctionCall` requests.
 54:     *   `finish_reason`: Why the LLM stopped generating (e.g., "stop", "length", "function_calls").
 55:     *   `usage`: How many input (`prompt_tokens`) and output (`completion_tokens`) tokens were used.
 56:     *   `cached`: Whether the response came from a cache.
 57: 
 58: 6.  **Token Tracking:** The client automatically tracks token usage (`prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`) for each call. You can query the total usage via methods like `total_usage()`. This is vital for monitoring costs, as most LLM APIs charge based on tokens.
 59: 
 60: ## Use Case Example: Summarizing Text with an LLM
 61: 
 62: Let's build a simplified scenario where we use a `ChatCompletionClient` to ask an LLM to summarize text.
 63: 
 64: **Goal:** Send text to an LLM via a client and get a summary back.
 65: 
 66: **Step 1: Prepare the Input Messages**
 67: 
 68: We need to structure our request as a list of `LLMMessage` objects.
 69: 
 70: ```python
 71: # File: prepare_messages.py
 72: from autogen_core.models import SystemMessage, UserMessage
 73: 
 74: # Instructions for the LLM
 75: system_prompt = SystemMessage(
 76:     content="You are a helpful assistant designed to summarize text concisely."
 77: )
 78: 
 79: # The text we want to summarize
 80: article_text = """
 81: AutoGen is a framework that enables the development of LLM applications using multiple agents
 82: that can converse with each other to solve tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable,
 83: conversable, and can seamlessly allow human participation. They can operate in various modes
 84: that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools.
 85: """
 86: user_request = UserMessage(
 87:     content=f"Please summarize the following text in one sentence:\n\n{article_text}",
 88:     source="User" # Indicate who provided this input
 89: )
 90: 
 91: # Combine into a list for the client
 92: messages_to_send = [system_prompt, user_request]
 93: 
 94: print("Messages prepared:")
 95: for msg in messages_to_send:
 96:     print(f"- {msg.type}: {msg.content[:50]}...") # Print first 50 chars
 97: ```
 98: This code defines the instructions (`SystemMessage`) and the user's request (`UserMessage`) and puts them in a list, ready to be sent.
 99: 
100: **Step 2: Use the ChatCompletionClient (Conceptual)**
101: 
102: Now, we need an instance of a `ChatCompletionClient`. In a real application, you'd configure a specific client (like `OpenAIChatCompletionClient` with your API key). For this example, let's imagine we have a pre-configured client called `llm_client`.
103: 
104: ```python
105: # File: call_llm_client.py
106: import asyncio
107: from autogen_core.models import CreateResult, RequestUsage
108: # Assume 'messages_to_send' is from the previous step
109: # Assume 'llm_client' is a pre-configured ChatCompletionClient instance
110: # (e.g., llm_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(config=...))
111: 
112: async def get_summary(client, messages):
113:     print("\nSending messages to LLM via ChatCompletionClient...")
114:     try:
115:         # The core call: send messages, get structured result
116:         response: CreateResult = await client.create(
117:             messages=messages,
118:             # We aren't providing tools in this simple example
119:             tools=[]
120:         )
121:         print("Received response:")
122:         print(f"- Finish Reason: {response.finish_reason}")
123:         print(f"- Content: {response.content}") # This should be the summary
124:         print(f"- Usage (Tokens): Prompt={response.usage.prompt_tokens}, Completion={response.usage.completion_tokens}")
125:         print(f"- Cached: {response.cached}")
126: 
127:         # Also, check total usage tracked by the client
128:         total_usage = client.total_usage()
129:         print(f"\nClient Total Usage: Prompt={total_usage.prompt_tokens}, Completion={total_usage.completion_tokens}")
130: 
131:     except Exception as e:
132:         print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
133: 
134: # --- Placeholder for actual client ---
135: class MockChatCompletionClient: # Simulate a real client
136:     _total_usage = RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=0, completion_tokens=0)
137:     async def create(self, messages, tools=[], **kwargs) -> CreateResult:
138:         # Simulate API call and response
139:         prompt_len = sum(len(str(m.content)) for m in messages) // 4 # Rough token estimate
140:         summary = "AutoGen is a multi-agent framework for developing LLM applications."
141:         completion_len = len(summary) // 4 # Rough token estimate
142:         usage = RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=prompt_len, completion_tokens=completion_len)
143:         self._total_usage.prompt_tokens += usage.prompt_tokens
144:         self._total_usage.completion_tokens += usage.completion_tokens
145:         return CreateResult(
146:             finish_reason="stop", content=summary, usage=usage, cached=False
147:         )
148:     def total_usage(self) -> RequestUsage: return self._total_usage
149:     # Other required methods (count_tokens, model_info etc.) omitted for brevity
150: 
151: async def main():
152:     from prepare_messages import messages_to_send # Get messages from previous step
153:     mock_client = MockChatCompletionClient()
154:     await get_summary(mock_client, messages_to_send)
155: 
156: # asyncio.run(main()) # If you run this, it uses the mock client
157: ```
158: This code shows the essential `client.create(...)` call. We pass our `messages_to_send` and receive a `CreateResult`. We then print the summary (`response.content`) and the token usage reported for that specific call (`response.usage`) and the total tracked by the client (`client.total_usage()`).
159: 
160: **How an Agent Uses It:**
161: Typically, an agent's logic (e.g., inside its `on_message` handler) would:
162: 1. Receive an incoming message (like the article to summarize).
163: 2. Prepare the list of `LLMMessage` objects (including system prompts, history, and the new request).
164: 3. Access a `ChatCompletionClient` instance (often provided during agent setup or accessed via its context).
165: 4. Call `await client.create(...)`.
166: 5. Process the `CreateResult` (e.g., extract the summary text, check for function calls if tools were provided).
167: 6. Potentially send the result as a new message to another agent or return it.
168:

171: What happens when you call `await client.create(...)`?
172: 
173: **Conceptual Flow:**
174: 
175: ```mermaid
176: sequenceDiagram
177:     participant Agent as Agent Logic
178:     participant Client as ChatCompletionClient
179:     participant Formatter as API Formatter
180:     participant HTTP as HTTP Client
181:     participant LLM_API as External LLM API
182: 
183:     Agent->>+Client: create(messages, tools)
184:     Client->>+Formatter: Format messages & tools for specific API (e.g., OpenAI JSON format)
185:     Formatter-->>-Client: Return formatted request body
186:     Client->>+HTTP: Send POST request to LLM API endpoint with formatted body & API Key
187:     HTTP->>+LLM_API: Transmit request over network
188:     LLM_API->>LLM_API: Process request, generate completion/function call
189:     LLM_API-->>-HTTP: Return API response (e.g., JSON)
190:     HTTP-->>-Client: Receive HTTP response
191:     Client->>+Formatter: Parse API response (extract content, usage, finish_reason)
192:     Formatter-->>-Client: Return parsed data
193:     Client->>Client: Create standard CreateResult object
194:     Client-->>-Agent: Return CreateResult
195: ```
196: 
197: 1.  **Prepare:** The `ChatCompletionClient` takes the standard `LLMMessage` list and `ToolSchema` list.
198: 2.  **Format:** It translates these into the specific format required by the target LLM's API (e.g., the JSON structure expected by OpenAI's `/chat/completions` endpoint). This might involve renaming roles (like `SystemMessage` to `system`), formatting tool descriptions, etc.
199: 3.  **Request:** It uses an underlying HTTP client to send a network request (usually a POST request) to the LLM service's API endpoint, including the formatted data and authentication (like an API key).
200: 4.  **Wait & Receive:** It waits for the LLM service to process the request and send back a response over the network.
201: 5.  **Parse:** It receives the raw HTTP response (usually JSON) from the API.
202: 6.  **Standardize:** It parses this specific API response, extracting the generated text or function calls, token usage figures, finish reason, etc.
203: 7.  **Return:** It packages all this information into a standard `CreateResult` object and returns it to the calling agent code.
204: 
205: **Code Glimpse:**
206: 
207: *   **`ChatCompletionClient` Protocol (`models/_model_client.py`):** This is the abstract base class (or protocol) defining the *contract* that all specific clients must follow.
208: 
209:     ```python
210:     # From: models/_model_client.py (Simplified ABC)
211:     from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
212:     from typing import Sequence, Optional, Mapping, Any, AsyncGenerator, Union
213:     from ._types import LLMMessage, CreateResult, RequestUsage
214:     from ..tools import Tool, ToolSchema
215:     from .. import CancellationToken
216: 
217:     class ChatCompletionClient(ABC):
218:         @abstractmethod
219:         async def create(
220:             self, messages: Sequence[LLMMessage], *,
221:             tools: Sequence[Tool | ToolSchema] = [],
222:             json_output: Optional[bool] = None, # Hint for JSON mode
223:             extra_create_args: Mapping[str, Any] = {}, # API-specific args
224:             cancellation_token: Optional[CancellationToken] = None,
225:         ) -> CreateResult: ... # The core method
226: 
227:         @abstractmethod
228:         def create_stream(
229:             self, # Similar to create, but yields results incrementally
230:             # ... parameters ...
231:         ) -> AsyncGenerator[Union[str, CreateResult], None]: ...
232: 
233:         @abstractmethod
234:         def total_usage(self) -> RequestUsage: ... # Get total tracked usage
235: 
236:         @abstractmethod
237:         def count_tokens(self, messages: Sequence[LLMMessage], *, tools: Sequence[Tool | ToolSchema] = []) -> int: ... # Estimate token count
238: 
239:         # Other methods like close(), actual_usage(), remaining_tokens(), model_info...
240:     ```
241:     Concrete classes like `OpenAIChatCompletionClient`, `AnthropicChatCompletionClient` etc., implement these methods using the specific libraries and API calls for each service.
242: 
243: *   **`LLMMessage` Types (`models/_types.py`):** These define the structure of messages passed *to* the client.
244: 
245:     ```python
246:     # From: models/_types.py (Simplified)
247:     from pydantic import BaseModel
248:     from typing import List, Union, Literal
249:     from .. import FunctionCall # From Chapter 4 context
250: 
251:     class SystemMessage(BaseModel):
252:         content: str
253:         type: Literal["SystemMessage"] = "SystemMessage"
254: 
255:     class UserMessage(BaseModel):
256:         content: Union[str, List[Union[str, Image]]] # Can include images!
257:         source: str
258:         type: Literal["UserMessage"] = "UserMessage"
259: 
260:     class AssistantMessage(BaseModel):
261:         content: Union[str, List[FunctionCall]] # Can be text or function calls
262:         source: str
263:         type: Literal["AssistantMessage"] = "AssistantMessage"
264: 
265:     # FunctionExecutionResultMessage also exists here...
266:     ```
267: 
268: *   **`CreateResult` (`models/_types.py`):** This defines the structure of the response *from* the client.
269: 
270:     ```python
271:     # From: models/_types.py (Simplified)
272:     from pydantic import BaseModel
273:     from dataclasses import dataclass
274:     from typing import Union, List, Optional
275:     from .. import FunctionCall
276: 
277:     @dataclass
278:     class RequestUsage:
279:         prompt_tokens: int
280:         completion_tokens: int
281: 
282:     FinishReasons = Literal["stop", "length", "function_calls", "content_filter", "unknown"]
283: 
284:     class CreateResult(BaseModel):
285:         finish_reason: FinishReasons
286:         content: Union[str, List[FunctionCall]] # LLM output
287:         usage: RequestUsage # Token usage for this call
288:         cached: bool
289:         # Optional fields like logprobs, thought...
290:     ```
291:     Using these standard types ensures that agent logic can work consistently, even if you switch the underlying LLM service by using a different `ChatCompletionClient` implementation.
292: 
293: ## Next Steps
294: 
295: You now understand the role of `ChatCompletionClient` as the crucial link between AutoGen agents and the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models. It provides a standard way to send conversational history and tool definitions, receive generated text or function call requests, and track token usage.
296: 
297: Managing the conversation history (`messages`) sent to the client is very important. How do you ensure the LLM has the right context, especially after tool calls have happened?
298: 
299: *   [Chapter 6: ChatCompletionContext](06_chatcompletioncontext.md): Learn how AutoGen helps manage the conversation history, including adding tool call requests and their results, before sending it to the `ChatCompletionClient`.

  8: # Chapter 6: ChatCompletionContext - Remembering the Conversation
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 5: ChatCompletionClient](05_chatcompletionclient.md), we learned how agents talk to Large Language Models (LLMs) using a `ChatCompletionClient`. We saw that we need to send a list of `messages` (the conversation history) to the LLM so it knows the context.
 11: 
 12: But conversations can get very long! Imagine talking on the phone for an hour. Can you remember *every single word* that was said? Probably not. You remember the main points, the beginning, and what was said most recently. LLMs have a similar limitation – they can only pay attention to a certain amount of text at once (called the "context window").
 13: 
 14: If we send the *entire* history of a very long chat, it might be too much for the LLM, lead to errors, be slow, or cost more money (since many LLMs charge based on the amount of text).
 15: 
 16: So, how do we smartly choose *which* parts of the conversation history to send? This is the problem that **`ChatCompletionContext`** solves.
 17: 
 18: ## Motivation: Keeping LLM Conversations Focused
 19: 
 20: Let's say we have a helpful assistant agent chatting with a user:
 21: 
 22: 1.  **User:** "Hi! Can you tell me about AutoGen?"
 23: 2.  **Assistant:** "Sure! AutoGen is a framework..." (provides details)
 24: 3.  **User:** "Thanks! Now, can you draft an email to my team about our upcoming meeting?"
 25: 4.  **Assistant:** "Okay, what's the meeting about?"
 26: 5.  **User:** "It's about the project planning for Q3."
 27: 6.  **Assistant:** (Needs to draft the email)
 28: 
 29: When the Assistant needs to draft the email (step 6), does it need the *exact* text from step 2 about what AutoGen is? Probably not. It definitely needs the instructions from step 3 and the topic from step 5. Maybe the initial greeting isn't super important either.
 30: 
 31: `ChatCompletionContext` acts like a **smart transcript editor**. Before sending the history to the LLM via the `ChatCompletionClient`, it reviews the full conversation log and prepares a shorter, focused version containing only the messages it thinks are most relevant for the LLM's next response.
 32: 
 33: ## Key Concepts: Managing the Chat History
 34: 
 35: 1.  **The Full Transcript Holder:** A `ChatCompletionContext` object holds the *complete* list of messages (`LLMMessage` objects like `SystemMessage`, `UserMessage`, `AssistantMessage` from Chapter 5) that have occurred in a specific conversation thread. You add new messages using its `add_message` method.
 36: 
 37: 2.  **The Smart View Generator (`get_messages`):** The core job of `ChatCompletionContext` is done by its `get_messages` method. When called, it looks at the *full* transcript it holds, but returns only a *subset* of those messages based on its specific strategy. This subset is what you'll actually send to the `ChatCompletionClient`.
 38: 
 39: 3.  **Different Strategies for Remembering:** Because different situations require different focus, AutoGen Core provides several `ChatCompletionContext` implementations (strategies):
 40:     *   **`UnboundedChatCompletionContext`:** The simplest (and sometimes riskiest!). It doesn't edit anything; `get_messages` just returns the *entire* history. Good for short chats, but can break with long ones.
 41:     *   **`BufferedChatCompletionContext`:** Like remembering only the last few things someone said. It keeps the most recent `N` messages (where `N` is the `buffer_size` you set). Good for focusing on recent interactions.
 42:     *   **`HeadAndTailChatCompletionContext`:** Tries to get the best of both worlds. It keeps the first few messages (the "head", maybe containing initial instructions) and the last few messages (the "tail", the recent context). It skips the messages in the middle.
 43: 
 44: ## Use Case Example: Chatting with Different Memory Strategies
 45: 
 46: Let's simulate adding messages to different context managers and see what `get_messages` returns.
 47: 
 48: **Step 1: Define some messages**
 49: 
 50: ```python
 51: # File: define_chat_messages.py
 52: from autogen_core.models import (
 53:     SystemMessage, UserMessage, AssistantMessage, LLMMessage
 54: )
 55: from typing import List
 56: 
 57: # The initial instruction for the assistant
 58: system_msg = SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant.")
 59: 
 60: # A sequence of user/assistant turns
 61: chat_sequence: List[LLMMessage] = [
 62:     UserMessage(content="What is AutoGen?", source="User"),
 63:     AssistantMessage(content="AutoGen is a multi-agent framework...", source="Agent"),
 64:     UserMessage(content="What can it do?", source="User"),
 65:     AssistantMessage(content="It can build complex LLM apps.", source="Agent"),
 66:     UserMessage(content="Thanks!", source="User")
 67: ]
 68: 
 69: # Combine system message and the chat sequence
 70: full_history: List[LLMMessage] = [system_msg] + chat_sequence
 71: 
 72: print(f"Total messages in full history: {len(full_history)}")
 73: # Output: Total messages in full history: 6
 74: ```
 75: We have a full history of 6 messages (1 system + 5 chat turns).
 76: 
 77: **Step 2: Use `UnboundedChatCompletionContext`**
 78: 
 79: This context keeps everything.
 80: 
 81: ```python
 82: # File: use_unbounded_context.py
 83: import asyncio
 84: from define_chat_messages import full_history
 85: from autogen_core.model_context import UnboundedChatCompletionContext
 86: 
 87: async def main():
 88:     # Create context and add all messages
 89:     context = UnboundedChatCompletionContext()
 90:     for msg in full_history:
 91:         await context.add_message(msg)
 92: 
 93:     # Get the messages to send to the LLM
 94:     messages_for_llm = await context.get_messages()
 95: 
 96:     print(f"--- Unbounded Context ({len(messages_for_llm)} messages) ---")
 97:     for i, msg in enumerate(messages_for_llm):
 98:         print(f"{i+1}. [{msg.type}]: {msg.content[:30]}...")
 99: 
100: # asyncio.run(main()) # If run
101: ```
102: 
103: **Expected Output (Unbounded):**
104: ```
105: --- Unbounded Context (6 messages) ---
106: 1. [SystemMessage]: You are a helpful assistant....
107: 2. [UserMessage]: What is AutoGen?...
108: 3. [AssistantMessage]: AutoGen is a multi-agent fram...
109: 4. [UserMessage]: What can it do?...
110: 5. [AssistantMessage]: It can build complex LLM apps...
111: 6. [UserMessage]: Thanks!...
112: ```
113: It returns all 6 messages, exactly as added.
114: 
115: **Step 3: Use `BufferedChatCompletionContext`**
116: 
117: Let's keep only the last 3 messages.
118: 
119: ```python
120: # File: use_buffered_context.py
121: import asyncio
122: from define_chat_messages import full_history
123: from autogen_core.model_context import BufferedChatCompletionContext
124: 
125: async def main():
126:     # Keep only the last 3 messages
127:     context = BufferedChatCompletionContext(buffer_size=3)
128:     for msg in full_history:
129:         await context.add_message(msg)
130: 
131:     messages_for_llm = await context.get_messages()
132: 
133:     print(f"--- Buffered Context (buffer=3, {len(messages_for_llm)} messages) ---")
134:     for i, msg in enumerate(messages_for_llm):
135:         print(f"{i+1}. [{msg.type}]: {msg.content[:30]}...")
136: 
137: # asyncio.run(main()) # If run
138: ```
139: 
140: **Expected Output (Buffered):**
141: ```
142: --- Buffered Context (buffer=3, 3 messages) ---
143: 1. [UserMessage]: What can it do?...
144: 2. [AssistantMessage]: It can build complex LLM apps...
145: 3. [UserMessage]: Thanks!...
146: ```
147: It only returns the last 3 messages from the full history. The system message and the first chat turn are omitted.
148: 
149: **Step 4: Use `HeadAndTailChatCompletionContext`**
150: 
151: Let's keep the first message (head=1) and the last two messages (tail=2).
152: 
153: ```python
154: # File: use_head_tail_context.py
155: import asyncio
156: from define_chat_messages import full_history
157: from autogen_core.model_context import HeadAndTailChatCompletionContext
158: 
159: async def main():
160:     # Keep first 1 and last 2 messages
161:     context = HeadAndTailChatCompletionContext(head_size=1, tail_size=2)
162:     for msg in full_history:
163:         await context.add_message(msg)
164: 
165:     messages_for_llm = await context.get_messages()
166: 
167:     print(f"--- Head & Tail Context (h=1, t=2, {len(messages_for_llm)} messages) ---")
168:     for i, msg in enumerate(messages_for_llm):
169:         print(f"{i+1}. [{msg.type}]: {msg.content[:30]}...")
170: 
171: # asyncio.run(main()) # If run
172: ```
173: 
174: **Expected Output (Head & Tail):**
175: ```
176: --- Head & Tail Context (h=1, t=2, 4 messages) ---
177: 1. [SystemMessage]: You are a helpful assistant....
178: 2. [UserMessage]: Skipped 3 messages....
179: 3. [AssistantMessage]: It can build complex LLM apps...
180: 4. [UserMessage]: Thanks!...
181: ```
182: It keeps the very first message (`SystemMessage`), then inserts a placeholder telling the LLM that some messages were skipped, and finally includes the last two messages. This preserves the initial instruction and the most recent context.
183: 
184: **Which one to choose?** It depends on your agent's task!
185: *   Simple Q&A? `Buffered` might be fine.
186: *   Following complex initial instructions? `HeadAndTail` or even `Unbounded` (if short) might be better.
187: 
188: ## Under the Hood: How Context is Managed
189: 
190: The core idea is defined by the `ChatCompletionContext` abstract base class.
191: 
192: **Conceptual Flow:**
193: 
194: ```mermaid
195: sequenceDiagram
196:     participant Agent as Agent Logic
197:     participant Context as ChatCompletionContext
198:     participant FullHistory as Internal Message List
199: 
200:     Agent->>+Context: add_message(newMessage)
201:     Context->>+FullHistory: Append newMessage to list
202:     FullHistory-->>-Context: List updated
203:     Context-->>-Agent: Done
204: 
205:     Agent->>+Context: get_messages()
206:     Context->>+FullHistory: Read the full list
207:     FullHistory-->>-Context: Return full list
208:     Context->>Context: Apply Strategy (e.g., slice list for Buffered/HeadTail)
209:     Context-->>-Agent: Return selected list of messages
210: ```
211: 
212: 1.  **Adding:** When `add_message(message)` is called, the context simply appends the `message` to its internal list (`self._messages`).
213: 2.  **Getting:** When `get_messages()` is called:
214:     *   The context accesses its internal `self._messages` list.
215:     *   The specific implementation (`Unbounded`, `Buffered`, `HeadAndTail`) applies its logic to select which messages to return.
216:     *   It returns the selected list.
217: 
218: **Code Glimpse:**
219: 
220: *   **Base Class (`_chat_completion_context.py`):** Defines the structure and common methods.
221: 
222:     ```python
223:     # From: model_context/_chat_completion_context.py (Simplified)

227: 
228:     class ChatCompletionContext(ABC):

230: 
231:         def __init__(self, initial_messages: List[LLMMessage] | None = None) -> None:
232:             # Holds the COMPLETE history
233:             self._messages: List[LLMMessage] = initial_messages or []
234: 
235:         async def add_message(self, message: LLMMessage) -> None:
236:             """Add a message to the full context."""
237:             self._messages.append(message)
238:

242:             # Each subclass MUST implement this logic
243:             ...
244: 
245:         # Other methods like clear(), save_state(), load_state() exist too
246:     ```
247:     The base class handles storing messages; subclasses define *how* to retrieve them.
248: 
249: *   **Unbounded (`_unbounded_chat_completion_context.py`):** The simplest implementation.
250: 
251:     ```python

260:             return self._messages # Just return the whole internal list
261:     ```
262: 
263: *   **Buffered (`_buffered_chat_completion_context.py`):** Uses slicing to get the end of the list.

278:             # Slice the list to get the last 'buffer_size' items

283:             return messages
284:     ```
285: 
286: *   **Head and Tail (`_head_and_tail_chat_completion_context.py`):** Combines slices from the beginning and end.
287: 
288:     ```python
289:     # From: model_context/_head_and_tail_chat_completion_context.py (Simplified)
290:     from typing import List

296:             super().__init__(...)
297:             self._head_size = head_size
298:             self._tail_size = tail_size
299: 
300:         async def get_messages(self) -> List[LLMMessage]:
301:             head = self._messages[: self._head_size] # First 'head_size' items
302:             tail = self._messages[-self._tail_size :] # Last 'tail_size' items
303:             num_skipped = len(self._messages) - len(head) - len(tail)
304: 
305:             if num_skipped <= 0: # If no overlap or gap
306:                 return self._messages
307:             else: # If messages were skipped
308:                 placeholder = [UserMessage(content=f"Skipped {num_skipped} messages.", source="System")]
309:                 # Combine head + placeholder + tail
310:                 return head + placeholder + tail
311:     ```
312:     These implementations provide different ways to manage the context window effectively.
313: 
314: ## Putting it Together with ChatCompletionClient
315: 
316: How does an agent use `ChatCompletionContext` with the `ChatCompletionClient` from Chapter 5?
317: 
318: 1.  An agent has an instance of a `ChatCompletionContext` (e.g., `BufferedChatCompletionContext`) to store its conversation history.
319: 2.  When the agent receives a new message (e.g., a `UserMessage`), it calls `await context.add_message(new_user_message)`.
320: 3.  To prepare for calling the LLM, the agent calls `messages_to_send = await context.get_messages()`. This gets the strategically selected subset of the history.
321: 4.  The agent then passes this list to the `ChatCompletionClient`: `response = await llm_client.create(messages=messages_to_send, ...)`.
322: 5.  When the LLM replies (e.g., with an `AssistantMessage`), the agent adds it back to the context: `await context.add_message(llm_response_message)`.
323: 
324: This loop ensures that the history is continuously updated and intelligently trimmed before each call to the LLM.
325: 
326: ## Next Steps
327: 
328: You've learned how `ChatCompletionContext` helps manage the conversation history sent to LLMs, preventing context window overflows and keeping the interaction focused using different strategies (`Unbounded`, `Buffered`, `HeadAndTail`).
329: 
330: This context management is a specific form of **memory**. Agents might need to remember things beyond just the chat history. How do they store general information, state, or knowledge over time?
331: 
332: *   [Chapter 7: Memory](07_memory.md): Explore the broader concept of Memory in AutoGen Core, which provides more general ways for agents to store and retrieve information.
333: *   [Chapter 8: Component](08_component.md): Understand how `ChatCompletionContext` fits into the general `Component` model, allowing configuration and integration within the AutoGen system.

  8: # Chapter 7: Memory - The Agent's Notebook
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 6: ChatCompletionContext](06_chatcompletioncontext.md), we saw how agents manage the *short-term* history of a single conversation before talking to an LLM. It's like remembering what was just said in the last few minutes.
 11: 
 12: But what if an agent needs to remember things for much longer, across *multiple* conversations or tasks? For example, imagine an assistant agent that learns your preferences:
 13: *   You tell it: "Please always write emails in a formal style for me."
 14: *   Weeks later, you ask it to draft a new email.
 15: 
 16: How does it remember that preference? The short-term `ChatCompletionContext` might have forgotten the earlier instruction, especially if using a strategy like `BufferedChatCompletionContext`. The agent needs a **long-term memory**.
 17: 
 18: This is where the **`Memory`** abstraction comes in. Think of it as the agent's **long-term notebook or database**. While `ChatCompletionContext` is the scratchpad for the current chat, `Memory` holds persistent information the agent can add to or look up later.
 19: 
 20: ## Motivation: Remembering Across Conversations
 21: 
 22: Our goal is to give an agent the ability to store a piece of information (like a user preference) and retrieve it later to influence its behavior, even in a completely new conversation. `Memory` provides the mechanism for this long-term storage and retrieval.
 23: 
 24: ## Key Concepts: How the Notebook Works
 25: 
 26: 1.  **What it Stores (`MemoryContent`):** Agents can store various types of information in their memory. This could be:
 27:     *   Plain text notes (`text/plain`)
 28:     *   Structured data like JSON (`application/json`)
 29:     *   Even images (`image/*`)
 30:     Each piece of information is wrapped in a `MemoryContent` object, which includes the data itself, its type (`mime_type`), and optional descriptive `metadata`.
 31: 
 32:     ```python
 33:     # From: memory/_base_memory.py (Simplified Concept)
 34:     from pydantic import BaseModel
 35:     from typing import Any, Dict, Union
 36: 
 37:     # Represents one entry in the memory notebook
 38:     class MemoryContent(BaseModel):
 39:         content: Union[str, bytes, Dict[str, Any]] # The actual data
 40:         mime_type: str # What kind of data (e.g., "text/plain")
 41:         metadata: Dict[str, Any] | None = None # Extra info (optional)
 42:     ```
 43:     This standard format helps manage different kinds of memories.
 44: 
 45: 2.  **Adding to Memory (`add`):** When an agent learns something important it wants to remember long-term (like the user's preferred style), it uses the `memory.add(content)` method. This is like writing a new entry in the notebook.
 46: 
 47: 3.  **Querying Memory (`query`):** When an agent needs to recall information, it can use `memory.query(query_text)`. This is like searching the notebook for relevant entries. How the search works depends on the specific memory implementation (it could be a simple text match, or a sophisticated vector search in more advanced memories).
 48: 
 49: 4.  **Updating Chat Context (`update_context`):** This is a crucial link! Before an agent talks to the LLM (using the `ChatCompletionClient` from [Chapter 5](05_chatcompletionclient.md)), it can use `memory.update_context(chat_context)` method. This method:
 50:     *   Looks at the current conversation (`chat_context`).
 51:     *   Queries the long-term memory (`Memory`) for relevant information.
 52:     *   Injects the retrieved memories *into* the `chat_context`, often as a `SystemMessage`.
 53:     This way, the LLM gets the benefit of the long-term memory *in addition* to the short-term conversation history, right before generating its response.
 54: 
 55: 5.  **Different Memory Implementations:** Just like there are different `ChatCompletionContext` strategies, there can be different `Memory` implementations:
 56:     *   `ListMemory`: A very simple memory that stores everything in a Python list (like a simple chronological notebook).
 57:     *   *Future Possibilities*: More advanced implementations could use databases or vector stores for more efficient storage and retrieval of vast amounts of information.
 58: 
 59: ## Use Case Example: Remembering User Preferences with `ListMemory`
 60: 
 61: Let's implement our user preference use case using the simple `ListMemory`.
 62: 
 63: **Goal:**
 64: 1. Create a `ListMemory`.
 65: 2. Add a user preference ("formal style") to it.
 66: 3. Start a *new* chat context.
 67: 4. Use `update_context` to inject the preference into the new chat context.
 68: 5. Show how the chat context looks *before* being sent to the LLM.
 69: 
 70: **Step 1: Create the Memory**
 71: 
 72: We'll use `ListMemory`, the simplest implementation provided by AutoGen Core.
 73: 
 74: ```python
 75: # File: create_list_memory.py
 76: from autogen_core.memory import ListMemory
 77: 
 78: # Create a simple list-based memory instance
 79: user_prefs_memory = ListMemory(name="user_preferences")
 80: 
 81: print(f"Created memory: {user_prefs_memory.name}")
 82: print(f"Initial content: {user_prefs_memory.content}")
 83: # Output:
 84: # Created memory: user_preferences
 85: # Initial content: []
 86: ```
 87: We have an empty memory notebook named "user_preferences".
 88: 
 89: **Step 2: Add the Preference**
 90: 
 91: Let's add the user's preference as a piece of text memory.
 92: 
 93: ```python
 94: # File: add_preference.py
 95: import asyncio
 96: from autogen_core.memory import MemoryContent
 97: # Assume user_prefs_memory exists from the previous step
 98: 
 99: # Define the preference as MemoryContent
100: preference = MemoryContent(
101:     content="User prefers all communication to be written in a formal style.",
102:     mime_type="text/plain", # It's just text
103:     metadata={"source": "user_instruction_conversation_1"} # Optional info
104: )
105: 
106: async def add_to_memory():
107:     # Add the content to our memory instance
108:     await user_prefs_memory.add(preference)
109:     print(f"Memory content after adding: {user_prefs_memory.content}")
110: 
111: asyncio.run(add_to_memory())
112: # Output (will show the MemoryContent object):
113: # Memory content after adding: [MemoryContent(content='User prefers...', mime_type='text/plain', metadata={'source': '...'})]
114: ```
115: We've successfully written the preference into our `ListMemory` notebook.
116: 
117: **Step 3: Start a New Chat Context**
118: 
119: Imagine time passes, and the user starts a new conversation asking for an email draft. We create a fresh `ChatCompletionContext`.
120: 
121: ```python
122: # File: start_new_chat.py
123: from autogen_core.model_context import UnboundedChatCompletionContext
124: from autogen_core.models import UserMessage
125: 
126: # Start a new, empty chat context for a new task
127: new_chat_context = UnboundedChatCompletionContext()
128: 
129: # Add the user's new request
130: new_request = UserMessage(content="Draft an email to the team about the Q3 results.", source="User")
131: # await new_chat_context.add_message(new_request) # In a real app, add the request
132: 
133: print("Created a new, empty chat context.")
134: # Output: Created a new, empty chat context.
135: ```
136: This context currently *doesn't* know about the "formal style" preference stored in our long-term memory.
137: 
138: **Step 4: Inject Memory into Chat Context**
139: 
140: Before sending the `new_chat_context` to the LLM, we use `update_context` to bring in relevant long-term memories.
141: 
142: ```python
143: # File: update_chat_with_memory.py
144: import asyncio
145: # Assume user_prefs_memory exists (with the preference added)
146: # Assume new_chat_context exists (empty or with just the new request)
147: # Assume new_request exists
148: 
149: async def main():
150:     # --- This is where Memory connects to Chat Context ---
151:     print("Updating chat context with memory...")
152:     update_result = await user_prefs_memory.update_context(new_chat_context)
153:     print(f"Memories injected: {len(update_result.memories.results)}")
154: 
155:     # Now let's add the actual user request for this task
156:     await new_chat_context.add_message(new_request)
157: 
158:     # See what messages are now in the context
159:     messages_for_llm = await new_chat_context.get_messages()
160:     print("\nMessages to be sent to LLM:")
161:     for msg in messages_for_llm:
162:         print(f"- [{msg.type}]: {msg.content}")
163: 
164: asyncio.run(main())
165: ```
166: 
167: **Expected Output:**
168: ```
169: Updating chat context with memory...
170: Memories injected: 1
171: 
172: Messages to be sent to LLM:
173: - [SystemMessage]:
174: Relevant memory content (in chronological order):
175: 1. User prefers all communication to be written in a formal style.
176: 
177: - [UserMessage]: Draft an email to the team about the Q3 results.
178: ```
179: Look! The `ListMemory.update_context` method automatically queried the memory (in this simple case, it just takes *all* entries) and added a `SystemMessage` to the `new_chat_context`. This message explicitly tells the LLM about the stored preference *before* it sees the user's request to draft the email.
180: 
181: **Step 5: (Conceptual) Sending to LLM**
182: 
183: Now, if we were to send `messages_for_llm` to the `ChatCompletionClient` (Chapter 5):
184: 
185: ```python
186: # Conceptual code - Requires a configured client
187: # response = await llm_client.create(messages=messages_for_llm)
188: ```
189: The LLM would receive both the instruction about the formal style preference (from Memory) and the request to draft the email. It's much more likely to follow the preference now!
190: 
191: **Step 6: Direct Query (Optional)**
192: 
193: We can also directly query the memory if needed, without involving a chat context.
194: 
195: ```python
196: # File: query_memory.py
197: import asyncio
198: # Assume user_prefs_memory exists
199: 
200: async def main():
201:     # Query the memory (ListMemory returns all items regardless of query text)
202:     query_result = await user_prefs_memory.query("style preference")
203:     print("\nDirect query result:")
204:     for item in query_result.results:
205:         print(f"- Content: {item.content}, Type: {item.mime_type}")
206: 
207: asyncio.run(main())
208: # Output:
209: # Direct query result:
210: # - Content: User prefers all communication to be written in a formal style., Type: text/plain
211: ```
212: This shows how an agent could specifically look things up in its notebook.
213: 
214: ## Under the Hood: How `ListMemory` Injects Context
215: 
216: Let's trace the `update_context` call for `ListMemory`.
217: 
218: **Conceptual Flow:**
219: 
220: ```mermaid
221: sequenceDiagram
222:     participant AgentLogic as Agent Logic
223:     participant ListMem as ListMemory
224:     participant InternalList as Memory's Internal List
225:     participant ChatCtx as ChatCompletionContext
226: 
227:     AgentLogic->>+ListMem: update_context(chat_context)
228:     ListMem->>+InternalList: Get all stored MemoryContent items
229:     InternalList-->>-ListMem: Return list of [pref_content]
230:     alt Memory list is NOT empty
231:         ListMem->>ListMem: Format memories into a single string (e.g., "1. pref_content")
232:         ListMem->>ListMem: Create SystemMessage with formatted string
233:         ListMem->>+ChatCtx: add_message(SystemMessage)
234:         ChatCtx-->>-ListMem: Context updated
235:     end
236:     ListMem->>ListMem: Create UpdateContextResult(memories=[pref_content])
237:     ListMem-->>-AgentLogic: Return UpdateContextResult
238: ```
239: 
240: 1.  The agent calls `user_prefs_memory.update_context(new_chat_context)`.
241: 2.  The `ListMemory` instance accesses its internal `_contents` list.
242: 3.  It checks if the list is empty. If not:
243: 4.  It iterates through the `MemoryContent` items in the list.
244: 5.  It formats them into a numbered string (like "Relevant memory content...\n1. Item 1\n2. Item 2...").
245: 6.  It creates a single `SystemMessage` containing this formatted string.
246: 7.  It calls `new_chat_context.add_message()` to add this `SystemMessage` to the chat history that will be sent to the LLM.
247: 8.  It returns an `UpdateContextResult` containing the list of memories it just processed.
248: 
249: **Code Glimpse:**
250: 
251: *   **`Memory` Protocol (`memory/_base_memory.py`):** Defines the required methods for any memory implementation.
252: 
253:     ```python
254:     # From: memory/_base_memory.py (Simplified ABC)
255:     from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
256:     # ... other imports: MemoryContent, MemoryQueryResult, UpdateContextResult, ChatCompletionContext
257: 
258:     class Memory(ABC):
259:         component_type = "memory"
260: 
261:         @abstractmethod
262:         async def update_context(self, model_context: ChatCompletionContext) -> UpdateContextResult: ...
263: 
264:         @abstractmethod
265:         async def query(self, query: str | MemoryContent, ...) -> MemoryQueryResult: ...
266: 
267:         @abstractmethod
268:         async def add(self, content: MemoryContent, ...) -> None: ...
269: 
270:         @abstractmethod
271:         async def clear(self) -> None: ...
272: 
273:         @abstractmethod
274:         async def close(self) -> None: ...
275:     ```
276:     Any class wanting to act as Memory must provide these methods.
277: 
278: *   **`ListMemory` Implementation (`memory/_list_memory.py`):**
279: 
280:     ```python
281:     # From: memory/_list_memory.py (Simplified)
282:     from typing import List
283:     # ... other imports: Memory, MemoryContent, ..., SystemMessage, ChatCompletionContext
284: 
285:     class ListMemory(Memory):
286:         def __init__(self, ..., memory_contents: List[MemoryContent] | None = None):
287:             # Stores memory items in a simple list
288:             self._contents: List[MemoryContent] = memory_contents or []
289: 
290:         async def add(self, content: MemoryContent, ...) -> None:
291:             """Add new content to the internal list."""
292:             self._contents.append(content)
293: 
294:         async def query(self, query: str | MemoryContent = "", ...) -> MemoryQueryResult:
295:             """Return all memories, ignoring the query."""
296:             # Simple implementation: just return everything
297:             return MemoryQueryResult(results=self._contents)
298: 
299:         async def update_context(self, model_context: ChatCompletionContext) -> UpdateContextResult:
300:             """Add all memories as a SystemMessage to the chat context."""
301:             if not self._contents: # Do nothing if memory is empty
302:                 return UpdateContextResult(memories=MemoryQueryResult(results=[]))
303: 
304:             # Format all memories into a numbered list string
305:             memory_strings = [f"{i}. {str(mem.content)}" for i, mem in enumerate(self._contents, 1)]
306:             memory_context_str = "Relevant memory content...\n" + "\n".join(memory_strings) + "\n"
307: 
308:             # Add this string as a SystemMessage to the provided chat context
309:             await model_context.add_message(SystemMessage(content=memory_context_str))
310: 
311:             # Return info about which memories were added
312:             return UpdateContextResult(memories=MemoryQueryResult(results=self._contents))
313: 
314:         # ... clear(), close(), config methods ...
315:     ```
316:     This shows the straightforward logic of `ListMemory`: store in a list, retrieve the whole list, and inject the whole list as a single system message into the chat context. More complex memories might use smarter retrieval (e.g., based on the `query` in `query()` or the last message in `update_context`) and inject memories differently.
317: 
318: ## Next Steps
319: 
320: You've learned about `Memory`, AutoGen Core's mechanism for giving agents long-term recall beyond the immediate conversation (`ChatCompletionContext`). We saw how `MemoryContent` holds information, `add` stores it, `query` retrieves it, and `update_context` injects relevant memories into the LLM's working context. We explored the simple `ListMemory` as a basic example.
321: 
322: Memory systems are crucial for agents that learn, adapt, or need to maintain state across interactions.
323: 
324: This concludes our deep dive into the core abstractions of AutoGen Core! We've covered Agents, Messaging, Runtime, Tools, LLM Clients, Chat Context, and now Memory. There's one final concept that ties many of these together from a configuration perspective:
325: 
326: *   [Chapter 8: Component](08_component.md): Understand the general `Component` model in AutoGen Core, how it allows pieces like `Memory`, `ChatCompletionContext`, and `ChatCompletionClient` to be configured and managed consistently.

  8: # Chapter 8: Component - The Standardized Building Blocks
  9: 
 10: Welcome to Chapter 8! In our journey so far, we've met several key players in AutoGen Core:
 11: *   [Agents](01_agent.md): The workers.
 12: *   [Messaging System](02_messaging_system__topic___subscription_.md): How they communicate.
 13: *   [AgentRuntime](03_agentruntime.md): The manager.
 14: *   [Tools](04_tool.md): Their special skills.
 15: *   [ChatCompletionClient](05_chatcompletionclient.md): How they talk to LLMs.
 16: *   [ChatCompletionContext](06_chatcompletioncontext.md): How they remember recent chat history.
 17: *   [Memory](07_memory.md): How they remember things long-term.
 18: 
 19: Now, imagine you've built a fantastic agent system using these parts. You've configured a specific `ChatCompletionClient` to use OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model, and you've set up a `ListMemory` (from Chapter 7) to store user preferences. How do you save this exact setup so you can easily recreate it later, or share it with a friend? And what if you later want to swap out the `gpt-4o` client for a different one, like Anthropic's Claude, without rewriting your agent's core logic?
 20: 
 21: This is where the **`Component`** concept comes in. It provides a standard way to define, configure, save, and load these reusable building blocks.
 22: 
 23: ## Motivation: Making Setups Portable and Swappable
 24: 
 25: Think of the parts we've used so far – `ChatCompletionClient`, `Memory`, `Tool` – like specialized **Lego bricks**. Each brick has a specific function (connecting to an LLM, remembering things, performing an action).
 26: 
 27: Wouldn't it be great if:
 28: 1.  Each Lego brick had a standard way to describe its properties (like "Red 2x4 Brick")?
 29: 2.  You could easily save the description of all the bricks used in your creation (your agent system)?
 30: 3.  Someone else could take that description and automatically rebuild your exact creation?
 31: 4.  You could easily swap a "Red 2x4 Brick" for a "Blue 2x4 Brick" without having to rebuild everything around it?
 32: 
 33: The `Component` abstraction in AutoGen Core provides exactly this! It makes your building blocks **configurable**, **savable**, **loadable**, and **swappable**.
 34: 
 35: ## Key Concepts: Understanding Components
 36: 
 37: Let's break down what makes the Component system work:
 38: 
 39: 1.  **Component:** A class (like `ListMemory` or `OpenAIChatCompletionClient`) that is designed to be a standard, reusable building block. It performs a specific role within the AutoGen ecosystem. Many core classes inherit from `Component` or related base classes.
 40: 
 41: 2.  **Configuration (`Config`):** Every Component has specific settings. For example, an `OpenAIChatCompletionClient` needs an API key and a model name. A `ListMemory` might have a name. These settings are defined in a standard way, usually using a Pydantic `BaseModel` specific to that component type. This `Config` acts like the "specification sheet" for the component instance.
 42: 
 43: 3.  **Saving Settings (`_to_config` method):** A Component instance knows how to generate its *current* configuration. It has an internal method, `_to_config()`, that returns a `Config` object representing its settings. This is like asking a configured Lego brick, "What color and size are you?"
 44: 
 45: 4.  **Loading Settings (`_from_config` class method):** A Component *class* knows how to create a *new* instance of itself from a given configuration. It has a class method, `_from_config(config)`, that takes a `Config` object and builds a new, configured component instance. This is like having instructions: "Build a brick with this color and size."
 46: 
 47: 5.  **`ComponentModel` (The Box):** This is the standard package format used to save and load components. It's like the label and instructions on the Lego box. A `ComponentModel` contains:
 48:     *   `provider`: A string telling AutoGen *which* Python class to use (e.g., `"autogen_core.memory.ListMemory"`).
 49:     *   `config`: A dictionary holding the specific settings for this instance (the output of `_to_config()`).
 50:     *   `component_type`: The general role of the component (e.g., `"memory"`, `"model"`, `"tool"`).
 51:     *   Other metadata like `version`, `description`, `label`.
 52: 
 53:     ```python
 54:     # From: _component_config.py (Conceptual Structure)
 55:     from pydantic import BaseModel
 56:     from typing import Dict, Any
 57: 
 58:     class ComponentModel(BaseModel):
 59:         provider: str # Path to the class (e.g., "autogen_core.memory.ListMemory")
 60:         config: Dict[str, Any] # The specific settings for this instance
 61:         component_type: str | None = None # Role (e.g., "memory")
 62:         # ... other fields like version, description, label ...
 63:     ```
 64:     This `ComponentModel` is what you typically save to a file (often as JSON or YAML).
 65: 
 66: ## Use Case Example: Saving and Loading `ListMemory`
 67: 
 68: Let's see how this works with the `ListMemory` we used in [Chapter 7: Memory](07_memory.md).
 69: 
 70: **Goal:**
 71: 1. Create a `ListMemory` instance.
 72: 2. Save its configuration using the Component system (`dump_component`).
 73: 3. Load that configuration to create a *new*, identical `ListMemory` instance (`load_component`).
 74: 
 75: **Step 1: Create and Configure a `ListMemory`**
 76: 
 77: First, let's make a memory component. `ListMemory` is already designed as a Component.
 78: 
 79: ```python
 80: # File: create_memory_component.py
 81: import asyncio
 82: from autogen_core.memory import ListMemory, MemoryContent
 83: 
 84: # Create an instance of ListMemory
 85: my_memory = ListMemory(name="user_prefs_v1")
 86: 
 87: # Add some content (from Chapter 7 example)
 88: async def add_content():
 89:     pref = MemoryContent(content="Use formal style", mime_type="text/plain")
 90:     await my_memory.add(pref)
 91:     print(f"Created memory '{my_memory.name}' with content: {my_memory.content}")
 92: 
 93: asyncio.run(add_content())
 94: # Output: Created memory 'user_prefs_v1' with content: [MemoryContent(content='Use formal style', mime_type='text/plain', metadata=None)]
 95: ```
 96: We have our configured `my_memory` instance.
 97: 
 98: **Step 2: Save the Configuration (`dump_component`)**
 99: 
100: Now, let's ask this component instance to describe itself by creating a `ComponentModel`.
101: 
102: ```python
103: # File: save_memory_config.py
104: # Assume 'my_memory' exists from the previous step
105: 
106: # Dump the component's configuration into a ComponentModel
107: memory_model = my_memory.dump_component()
108: 
109: # Let's print it (converting to dict for readability)
110: print("Saved ComponentModel:")
111: print(memory_model.model_dump_json(indent=2))
112: ```
113: 
114: **Expected Output:**
115: ```json
116: Saved ComponentModel:
117: {
118:   "provider": "autogen_core.memory.ListMemory",
119:   "component_type": "memory",
120:   "version": 1,
121:   "component_version": 1,
122:   "description": "ListMemory stores memory content in a simple list.",
123:   "label": "ListMemory",
124:   "config": {
125:     "name": "user_prefs_v1",
126:     "memory_contents": [
127:       {
128:         "content": "Use formal style",
129:         "mime_type": "text/plain",
130:         "metadata": null
131:       }
132:     ]
133:   }
134: }
135: ```
136: Look at the output! `dump_component` created a `ComponentModel` that contains:
137: *   `provider`: Exactly which class to use (`autogen_core.memory.ListMemory`).
138: *   `config`: The specific settings, including the `name` and even the `memory_contents` we added!
139: *   `component_type`: Its role is `"memory"`.
140: *   Other useful info like description and version.
141: 
142: You could save this JSON structure to a file (`my_memory_config.json`).
143: 
144: **Step 3: Load the Configuration (`load_component`)**
145: 
146: Now, imagine you're starting a new script or sharing the config file. You can load this `ComponentModel` to recreate the memory instance.
147: 
148: ```python
149: # File: load_memory_config.py
150: from autogen_core import ComponentModel
151: from autogen_core.memory import ListMemory # Need the class for type hint/loading
152: 
153: # Assume 'memory_model' is the ComponentModel we just created
154: # (or loaded from a file)
155: 
156: print(f"Loading component from ComponentModel (Provider: {memory_model.provider})...")
157: 
158: # Use the ComponentLoader mechanism (available on Component classes)
159: # to load the model. We specify the expected type (ListMemory).
160: loaded_memory: ListMemory = ListMemory.load_component(memory_model)
161: 
162: print(f"Successfully loaded memory!")
163: print(f"- Name: {loaded_memory.name}")
164: print(f"- Content: {loaded_memory.content}")
165: ```
166: 
167: **Expected Output:**
168: ```
169: Loading component from ComponentModel (Provider: autogen_core.memory.ListMemory)...
170: Successfully loaded memory!
171: - Name: user_prefs_v1
172: - Content: [MemoryContent(content='Use formal style', mime_type='text/plain', metadata=None)]
173: ```
174: Success! `load_component` read the `ComponentModel`, found the right class (`ListMemory`), used its `_from_config` method with the saved `config` data, and created a brand new `loaded_memory` instance that is identical to our original `my_memory`.
175: 
176: **Benefits Shown:**
177: *   **Reproducibility:** We saved the exact state (including content!) and loaded it perfectly.
178: *   **Configuration:** We could easily save this to a JSON/YAML file and manage it outside our Python code.
179: *   **Modularity (Conceptual):** If `ListMemory` and `VectorDBMemory` were both Components of type "memory", we could potentially load either one from a configuration file just by changing the `provider` and `config` in the file, without altering the agent code that *uses* the memory component (assuming the agent interacts via the standard `Memory` interface from Chapter 7).
180: 
181: ## Under the Hood: How Saving and Loading Work
182: 
183: Let's peek behind the curtain.
184: 
185: **Saving (`dump_component`) Flow:**
186: 
187: ```mermaid
188: sequenceDiagram
189:     participant User
190:     participant MyMemory as my_memory (ListMemory instance)
191:     participant ListMemConfig as ListMemoryConfig (Pydantic Model)
192:     participant CompModel as ComponentModel
193: 
194:     User->>+MyMemory: dump_component()
195:     MyMemory->>MyMemory: Calls internal self._to_config()
196:     MyMemory->>+ListMemConfig: Creates Config object (name="...", contents=[...])
197:     ListMemConfig-->>-MyMemory: Returns Config object
198:     MyMemory->>MyMemory: Gets provider string ("autogen_core.memory.ListMemory")
199:     MyMemory->>MyMemory: Gets component_type ("memory"), version, etc.
200:     MyMemory->>+CompModel: Creates ComponentModel(provider=..., config=config_dict, ...)
201:     CompModel-->>-MyMemory: Returns ComponentModel instance
202:     MyMemory-->>-User: Returns ComponentModel instance
203: ```
204: 
205: 1.  You call `my_memory.dump_component()`.
206: 2.  It calls its own `_to_config()` method. For `ListMemory`, this gathers the `name` and current `_contents`.
207: 3.  `_to_config()` returns a `ListMemoryConfig` object (a Pydantic model) holding these values.
208: 4.  `dump_component()` takes this `ListMemoryConfig` object, converts its data into a dictionary (`config` field).
209: 5.  It figures out its own class path (`provider`) and other metadata (`component_type`, `version`, etc.).
210: 6.  It packages all this into a `ComponentModel` object and returns it.
211: 
212: **Loading (`load_component`) Flow:**
213: 
214: ```mermaid
215: sequenceDiagram
216:     participant User
217:     participant Loader as ComponentLoader (e.g., ListMemory.load_component)
218:     participant Importer as Python Import System
219:     participant ListMemClass as ListMemory (Class definition)
220:     participant ListMemConfig as ListMemoryConfig (Pydantic Model)
221:     participant NewMemory as New ListMemory Instance
222: 
223:     User->>+Loader: load_component(component_model)
224:     Loader->>Loader: Reads provider ("autogen_core.memory.ListMemory") from model
225:     Loader->>+Importer: Imports the class `autogen_core.memory.ListMemory`
226:     Importer-->>-Loader: Returns ListMemory class object
227:     Loader->>+ListMemClass: Checks if it's a valid Component class
228:     Loader->>ListMemClass: Gets expected config schema (ListMemoryConfig)
229:     Loader->>+ListMemConfig: Validates `config` dict from model against schema
230:     ListMemConfig-->>-Loader: Returns validated ListMemoryConfig object
231:     Loader->>+ListMemClass: Calls _from_config(validated_config)
232:     ListMemClass->>+NewMemory: Creates new ListMemory instance using config
233:     NewMemory-->>-ListMemClass: Returns new instance
234:     ListMemClass-->>-Loader: Returns new instance
235:     Loader-->>-User: Returns the new ListMemory instance
236: ```
237: 
238: 1.  You call `ListMemory.load_component(memory_model)`.
239: 2.  The loader reads the `provider` string from `memory_model`.
240: 3.  It dynamically imports the class specified by `provider`.
241: 4.  It verifies this class is a proper `Component` subclass.
242: 5.  It finds the configuration schema defined by the class (e.g., `ListMemoryConfig`).
243: 6.  It validates the `config` dictionary from `memory_model` using this schema.
244: 7.  It calls the class's `_from_config()` method, passing the validated configuration object.
245: 8.  `_from_config()` uses the configuration data to initialize and return a new instance of the class (e.g., a new `ListMemory` with the loaded name and content).
246: 9.  The loader returns this newly created instance.
247: 
248: **Code Glimpse:**
249: 
250: The core logic lives in `_component_config.py`.
251: 
252: *   **`Component` Base Class:** Classes like `ListMemory` inherit from `Component`. This requires them to define `component_type`, `component_config_schema`, and implement `_to_config()` and `_from_config()`.
253: 
254:     ```python
255:     # From: _component_config.py (Simplified Concept)
256:     from pydantic import BaseModel
257:     from typing import Type, TypeVar, Generic, ClassVar
258:     # ... other imports
259: 
260:     ConfigT = TypeVar("ConfigT", bound=BaseModel)
261: 
262:     class Component(Generic[ConfigT]): # Generic over its config type
263:         # Required Class Variables for Concrete Components
264:         component_type: ClassVar[str]
265:         component_config_schema: Type[ConfigT]
266: 
267:         # Required Instance Method for Saving
268:         def _to_config(self) -> ConfigT:
269:             raise NotImplementedError
270: 
271:         # Required Class Method for Loading
272:         @classmethod
273:         def _from_config(cls, config: ConfigT) -> Self:
274:              raise NotImplementedError
275: 
276:         # dump_component and load_component are also part of the system
277:         # (often inherited from base classes like ComponentBase)
278:         def dump_component(self) -> ComponentModel: ...
279:         @classmethod
280:         def load_component(cls, model: ComponentModel | Dict[str, Any]) -> Self: ...
281:     ```
282: 
283: *   **`ComponentModel`:** As shown before, a Pydantic model to hold the `provider`, `config`, `type`, etc.
284: 
285: *   **`dump_component` Implementation (Conceptual):**
286:     ```python
287:     # Inside ComponentBase or similar
288:     def dump_component(self) -> ComponentModel:
289:         # 1. Get the specific config from the instance
290:         obj_config: BaseModel = self._to_config()
291:         config_dict = obj_config.model_dump() # Convert to dictionary
292: 
293:         # 2. Determine the provider string (class path)
294:         provider_str = _type_to_provider_str(self.__class__)
295:         # (Handle overrides like self.component_provider_override)
296: 
297:         # 3. Get other metadata
298:         comp_type = self.component_type
299:         comp_version = self.component_version
300:         # ... description, label ...
301: 
302:         # 4. Create and return the ComponentModel
303:         model = ComponentModel(
304:             provider=provider_str,
305:             config=config_dict,
306:             component_type=comp_type,
307:             version=comp_version,
308:             # ... other metadata ...
309:         )
310:         return model
311:     ```
312: 
313: *   **`load_component` Implementation (Conceptual):**
314:     ```python
315:     # Inside ComponentLoader or similar
316:     @classmethod
317:     def load_component(cls, model: ComponentModel | Dict[str, Any]) -> Self:
318:         # 1. Ensure we have a ComponentModel object
319:         if isinstance(model, dict):
320:             loaded_model = ComponentModel(**model)
321:         else:
322:             loaded_model = model
323: 
324:         # 2. Import the class based on the provider string
325:         provider_str = loaded_model.provider
326:         # ... (handle WELL_KNOWN_PROVIDERS mapping) ...
327:         module_path, class_name = provider_str.rsplit(".", 1)
328:         module = importlib.import_module(module_path)
329:         component_class = getattr(module, class_name)
330: 
331:         # 3. Validate the class and config
332:         if not is_component_class(component_class): # Check it's a valid Component
333:             raise TypeError(...)
334:         schema = component_class.component_config_schema
335:         validated_config = schema.model_validate(loaded_model.config)
336: 
337:         # 4. Call the class's factory method to create instance
338:         instance = component_class._from_config(validated_config)
339: 
340:         # 5. Return the instance (after type checks)
341:         return instance
342:     ```
343: 
344: This system provides a powerful and consistent way to manage the building blocks of your AutoGen applications.
345: 
346: ## Wrapping Up
347: 
348: Congratulations! You've reached the end of our core concepts tour. You now understand the `Component` model – AutoGen Core's standard way to define configurable, savable, and loadable building blocks like `Memory`, `ChatCompletionClient`, `Tool`, and even aspects of `Agents` themselves.
349: 
350: *   **Components** are like standardized Lego bricks.
351: *   They use **`_to_config`** to describe their settings.
352: *   They use **`_from_config`** to be built from settings.
353: *   **`ComponentModel`** is the standard "box" storing the provider and config, enabling saving/loading (often via JSON/YAML).
354: 
355: This promotes:
356: *   **Modularity:** Easily swap implementations (e.g., different LLM clients).
357: *   **Reproducibility:** Save and load exact agent system configurations.
358: *   **Configuration:** Manage settings in external files.
359: 
360: With these eight core concepts (`Agent`, `Messaging`, `AgentRuntime`, `Tool`, `ChatCompletionClient`, `ChatCompletionContext`, `Memory`, and `Component`), you have a solid foundation for understanding and building powerful multi-agent applications with AutoGen Core!
361: 
362: Happy building!

13: Think of it like creating a team of specialized workers (*Agents*) who can communicate and use tools to solve problems.
14: The **_AgentRuntime_** acts as the manager, handling messages and agent lifecycles.
15: Agents communicate using a **_Messaging System_** (Topics and Subscriptions), can use **_Tools_** for specific tasks, interact with language models via a **_ChatCompletionClient_** while managing conversation history with **_ChatCompletionContext_**, and remember information using **_Memory_**.
16: **_Components_** provide a standard way to define and configure these building blocks.

  8: # Chapter 1: The Agent - Your Browser Assistant's Brain
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the `Browser Use` tutorial! We're excited to help you learn how to automate web tasks using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs).
 11: 
 12: Imagine you want to perform a simple task, like searching Google for "cute cat pictures" and clicking on the very first image result. For a human, this is easy! You open your browser, type in the search, look at the results, and click.
 13: 
 14: But how do you tell a computer program to do this? It needs to understand the goal, look at the webpage like a human does, decide what to click or type next, and then actually perform those actions. This is where the **Agent** comes in.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Does the Agent Solve?
 17: 
 18: The Agent is the core orchestrator, the "brain" or "project manager" of your browser automation task. It connects all the different pieces needed to achieve your goal. Without the Agent, you'd have a bunch of tools (like a browser controller and an LLM) but no central coordinator telling them what to do and when.
 19: 
 20: The Agent solves the problem of turning a high-level goal (like "find cat pictures") into concrete actions on a webpage, using intelligence to adapt to what it "sees" in the browser.
 21: 
 22: ## Meet the Agent: Your Project Manager
 23: 
 24: Think of the `Agent` like a project manager overseeing a complex task. It doesn't do *all* the work itself, but it coordinates specialists:
 25: 
 26: 1.  **Receives the Task:** You give the Agent the overall goal (e.g., "Search Google for 'cute cat pictures' and click the first image result.").
 27: 2.  **Consults the Planner (LLM):** The Agent shows the current state of the webpage (using the [BrowserContext](03_browsercontext.md)) to a Large Language Model (LLM). It asks, "Here's the goal, and here's what the webpage looks like right now. What should be the very next step?" The LLM acts as a smart planner, suggesting actions like "type 'cute cat pictures' into the search bar" or "click the element with index 5". We'll learn more about how we instruct the LLM in the [System Prompt](02_system_prompt.md) chapter.
 28: 3.  **Manages History:** The Agent keeps track of everything that has happened so far – the actions taken, the results, and the state of the browser at each step. This "memory" is managed by the [Message Manager](06_message_manager.md) and helps the LLM make better decisions.
 29: 4.  **Instructs the Doer (Controller):** Once the LLM suggests an action (like "click element 5"), the Agent tells the [Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md) to actually perform that specific action within the browser.
 30: 5.  **Observes the Results (BrowserContext):** After the Controller acts, the Agent uses the [BrowserContext](03_browsercontext.md) again to see the new state of the webpage (e.g., the Google search results page).
 31: 6.  **Repeats:** The Agent repeats steps 2-5, continuously consulting the LLM, instructing the Controller, and observing the results, until the original task is complete or it reaches a stopping point.
 32: 
 33: ## Using the Agent: A Simple Example
 34: 
 35: Let's see how you might use the Agent in Python code. Don't worry about understanding every detail yet; focus on the main idea. We're setting up the Agent with our task and the necessary components.
 36: 
 37: ```python
 38: # --- Simplified Example ---
 39: # We need to import the necessary parts from the browser_use library
 40: from browser_use import Agent, Browser, Controller, BrowserConfig, BrowserContextConfig
 41: # Assume 'my_llm' is your configured Large Language Model (e.g., from OpenAI, Anthropic)
 42: from my_llm_setup import my_llm # Placeholder for your specific LLM setup
 43: 
 44: # 1. Define the task for the Agent
 45: my_task = "Go to google.com, search for 'cute cat pictures', and click the first image result."
 46: 
 47: # 2. Basic browser configuration (we'll learn more later)
 48: browser_config = BrowserConfig() # Default settings
 49: context_config = BrowserContextConfig() # Default settings
 50: 
 51: # 3. Initialize the components the Agent needs
 52: # The Browser manages the underlying browser application
 53: browser = Browser(config=browser_config)
 54: # The Controller knows *how* to perform actions like 'click' or 'type'
 55: controller = Controller()
 56: 
 57: async def main():
 58:     # The BrowserContext represents a single browser tab/window environment
 59:     # It uses the Browser and its configuration
 60:     async with BrowserContext(browser=browser, config=context_config) as browser_context:
 61: 
 62:         # 4. Create the Agent instance!
 63:         agent = Agent(
 64:             task=my_task,
 65:             llm=my_llm,                # The "brain" - the Language Model
 66:             browser_context=browser_context, # The "eyes" - interacts with the browser tab
 67:             controller=controller          # The "hands" - executes actions
 68:             # Many other settings can be configured here!
 69:         )
 70: 
 71:         print(f"Agent created. Starting task: {my_task}")
 72: 
 73:         # 5. Run the Agent! This starts the loop.
 74:         # It will keep taking steps until the task is done or it hits the limit.
 75:         history = await agent.run(max_steps=15) # Limit steps for safety
 76: 
 77:         # 6. Check the result
 78:         if history.is_done() and history.is_successful():
 79:             print("✅ Agent finished the task successfully!")
 80:             print(f"Final message from agent: {history.final_result()}")
 81:         else:
 82:             print("⚠️ Agent stopped. Maybe max_steps reached or task wasn't completed successfully.")
 83: 
 84:     # The 'async with' block automatically cleans up the browser_context
 85:     await browser.close() # Close the browser application
 86: 
 87: # Run the asynchronous function
 88: import asyncio
 89: asyncio.run(main())
 90: ```
 91: 
 92: **What happens when you run this?**
 93: 
 94: 1.  An `Agent` object is created with your task, the LLM, the browser context, and the controller.
 95: 2.  Calling `agent.run(max_steps=15)` starts the main loop.
 96: 3.  The Agent gets the initial state of the browser (likely a blank page).
 97: 4.  It asks the LLM what to do. The LLM might say "Go to google.com".
 98: 5.  The Agent tells the Controller to execute the "go to URL" action.
 99: 6.  The browser navigates to Google.
100: 7.  The Agent gets the new state (Google's homepage).
101: 8.  It asks the LLM again. The LLM says "Type 'cute cat pictures' into the search bar".
102: 9.  The Agent tells the Controller to type the text.
103: 10. This continues step-by-step: pressing Enter, seeing results, asking the LLM, clicking the image.
104: 11. Eventually, the LLM will hopefully tell the Agent the task is "done".
105: 12. `agent.run()` finishes and returns the `history` object containing details of what happened.
106: 
107: ## How it Works Under the Hood: The Agent Loop
108: 
109: Let's visualize the process with a simple diagram:
110: 
111: ```mermaid
112: sequenceDiagram
113:     participant User
114:     participant Agent
115:     participant LLM
116:     participant Controller
117:     participant BC as BrowserContext

119:     User->>Agent: Start task("Search Google for cats...")
120:     Note over Agent: Agent Loop Starts
121:     Agent->>BC: Get current state (e.g., blank page)

133:     Agent->>Controller: Execute: click_element(index=5)
134:     Controller->>BC: Perform click action
135:     Note over Agent: Loop continues until done...
136:     LLM-->>Agent: Plan: [Action: done(success=True, text='Found cat picture!')]
137:     Agent->>Controller: Execute: done(...)
138:     Controller-->>Agent: ActionResult (is_done=True)
139:     Note over Agent: Agent Loop Ends
140:     Agent->>User: Return History (Task Complete)
141: 
142: ```
143: 
144: The core of the `Agent` lives in the `agent/service.py` file. The `Agent` class manages the overall process.
145: 
146: 1.  **Initialization (`__init__`)**: When you create an `Agent`, it sets up its internal state, stores the task, the LLM, the controller, and prepares the [Message Manager](06_message_manager.md) to keep track of the conversation history. It also figures out the best way to talk to the specific LLM you provided.
147: 
148:     ```python
149:     # --- File: agent/service.py (Simplified __init__) ---
150:     class Agent:
151:         def __init__(
152:             self,
153:             task: str,
154:             llm: BaseChatModel,
155:             browser_context: BrowserContext,
156:             controller: Controller,
157:             # ... other settings like use_vision, max_failures, etc.
158:             **kwargs
159:         ):
160:             self.task = task
161:             self.llm = llm
162:             self.browser_context = browser_context
163:             self.controller = controller
164:             self.settings = AgentSettings(**kwargs) # Store various settings
165:             self.state = AgentState() # Internal state (step count, failures, etc.)
166: 
167:             # Setup message manager for history, using the task and system prompt
168:             self._message_manager = MessageManager(
169:                 task=self.task,
170:                 system_message=self.settings.system_prompt_class(...).get_system_message(),
171:                 settings=MessageManagerSettings(...)
172:                 # ... more setup ...
173:             )
174:             # ... other initializations ...
175:             logger.info("Agent initialized.")
176:     ```
177: 
178: 2.  **Running the Task (`run`)**: The `run` method orchestrates the main loop. It calls the `step` method repeatedly until the task is marked as done, an error occurs, or `max_steps` is reached.
179: 
180:     ```python
181:     # --- File: agent/service.py (Simplified run method) ---
182:     class Agent:
183:         # ... (init) ...
184:         async def run(self, max_steps: int = 100) -> AgentHistoryList:
185:             self._log_agent_run() # Log start event
186:             try:
187:                 for step_num in range(max_steps):
188:                     if self.state.stopped or self.state.consecutive_failures >= self.settings.max_failures:
189:                         break # Stop conditions
190: 
191:                     # Wait if paused
192:                     while self.state.paused: await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
193: 
194:                     step_info = AgentStepInfo(step_number=step_num, max_steps=max_steps)
195:                     await self.step(step_info) # <<< Execute one step of the loop
196: 
197:                     if self.state.history.is_done():
198:                         await self.log_completion() # Log success/failure
199:                         break # Exit loop if agent signaled 'done'
200:                 else:
201:                     logger.info("Max steps reached.") # Ran out of steps
202: 
203:             finally:
204:                 # ... (cleanup, telemetry, potentially save history/gif) ...
205:                 pass
206:             return self.state.history # Return the recorded history
207:     ```
208: 
209: 3.  **Taking a Step (`step`)**: This is the heart of the loop. In each step, the Agent:
210:     *   Gets the current browser state (`browser_context.get_state()`).
211:     *   Adds this state to the history via the `_message_manager`.
212:     *   Asks the LLM for the next action (`get_next_action()`).
213:     *   Tells the `Controller` to execute the action(s) (`multi_act()`).
214:     *   Records the outcome in the history.
215:     *   Handles any errors that might occur.
216: 
217:     ```python
218:     # --- File: agent/service.py (Simplified step method) ---
219:     class Agent:
220:         # ... (init, run) ...
221:         async def step(self, step_info: Optional[AgentStepInfo] = None) -> None:
222:             logger.info(f"📍 Step {self.state.n_steps}")
223:             state = None
224:             model_output = None
225:             result: list[ActionResult] = []
226: 
227:             try:
228:                 # 1. Get current state from the browser
229:                 state = await self.browser_context.get_state() # Uses BrowserContext
230: 
231:                 # 2. Add state (+ previous result) to message history for LLM context
232:                 self._message_manager.add_state_message(state, self.state.last_result, ...)
233: 
234:                 # 3. Get LLM's decision on the next action(s)
235:                 input_messages = self._message_manager.get_messages()
236:                 model_output = await self.get_next_action(input_messages) # Calls the LLM
237: 
238:                 self.state.n_steps += 1 # Increment step counter
239: 
240:                 # 4. Execute the action(s) using the Controller
241:                 result = await self.multi_act(model_output.action) # Uses Controller
242:                 self.state.last_result = result # Store result for next step's context
243: 
244:                 # 5. Record step details (actions, results, state snapshot)
245:                 self._make_history_item(model_output, state, result, ...)
246: 
247:                 self.state.consecutive_failures = 0 # Reset failure count on success
248: 
249:             except Exception as e:
250:                 # Handle errors, increment failure count, maybe retry later
251:                 result = await self._handle_step_error(e)
252:                 self.state.last_result = result
253:             # ... (finally block for logging/telemetry) ...
254:     ```
255: 
256: ## Conclusion
257: 
258: You've now met the `Agent`, the central coordinator in `Browser Use`. You learned that it acts like a project manager, taking your high-level task, consulting an LLM for step-by-step planning, managing the history, and instructing a `Controller` to perform actions within a `BrowserContext`.
259: 
260: The Agent's effectiveness heavily relies on how well we instruct the LLM planner. In the next chapter, we'll dive into exactly that: crafting the **System Prompt** to guide the LLM's behavior.

  8: # Chapter 2: The System Prompt - Setting the Rules for Your AI Assistant
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: The Agent](01_agent.md), we met the `Agent`, our project manager for automating browser tasks. We saw it consults a Large Language Model (LLM) – the "planner" – to decide the next steps based on the current state of the webpage. But how does the Agent tell the LLM *how* it should think, behave, and respond? Just giving it the task isn't enough!
 11: 
 12: Imagine hiring a new assistant. You wouldn't just say, "Organize my files!" You'd give them specific instructions: "Please sort the files alphabetically by client name, put them in the blue folders, and give me a summary list when you're done." Without these rules, the assistant might do something completely different!
 13: 
 14: The **System Prompt** solves this exact problem for our LLM. It's the set of core instructions and rules we give the LLM at the very beginning, telling it exactly how to act as a browser automation assistant and, crucially, how to format its responses so the `Agent` can understand them.
 15: 
 16: ## What is the System Prompt? The AI's Rulebook
 17: 
 18: Think of the System Prompt like the AI assistant's fundamental operating manual, its "Prime Directive," or the rules of a board game. It defines:
 19: 
 20: 1.  **Persona:** "You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks."
 21: 2.  **Goal:** "Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task..."
 22: 3.  **Input:** How to understand the information it receives about the webpage ([DOM Representation](04_dom_representation.md)).
 23: 4.  **Capabilities:** What actions it can take ([Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md)).
 24: 5.  **Limitations:** What it *shouldn't* do (e.g., hallucinate actions).
 25: 6.  **Response Format:** The *exact* structure (JSON format) its thoughts and planned actions must follow.
 26: 
 27: Without this rulebook, the LLM might just chat casually, give vague suggestions, or produce output in a format the `Agent` code can't parse. The System Prompt ensures the LLM behaves like the specialized tool we need.
 28: 
 29: ## Why is the Response Format So Important?
 30: 
 31: This is a critical point. The `Agent` code isn't a human reading the LLM's response. It's a program expecting data in a very specific structure. The System Prompt tells the LLM to *always* respond in a JSON format that looks something like this (simplified):
 32: 
 33: ```json
 34: {
 35:   "current_state": {
 36:     "evaluation_previous_goal": "Success - Found the search bar.",
 37:     "memory": "On google.com main page. Need to search for cats.",
 38:     "next_goal": "Type 'cute cat pictures' into the search bar."
 39:   },
 40:   "action": [
 41:     {
 42:       "input_text": {
 43:         "index": 5, // The index of the search bar element
 44:         "text": "cute cat pictures"
 45:       }
 46:     },
 47:     {
 48:       "press_keys": {
 49:         "keys": "Enter" // Press the Enter key
 50:       }
 51:     }
 52:   ]
 53: }
 54: ```
 55: 
 56: The `Agent` can easily read this JSON:
 57: *   It understands the LLM's thoughts (`current_state`).
 58: *   It sees the exact `action` list the LLM wants to perform.
 59: *   It passes these actions (like `input_text` or `press_keys`) to the [Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md) to execute them in the browser.
 60: 
 61: If the LLM responded with just "Okay, I'll type 'cute cat pictures' into the search bar and press Enter," the `Agent` wouldn't know *which* element index corresponds to the search bar or exactly which actions to call. The strict JSON format is essential for automation.
 62: 
 63: ## A Peek Inside the Rulebook (`system_prompt.md`)
 64: 
 65: The actual instructions live in a text file within the `Browser Use` library: `browser_use/agent/system_prompt.md`. It's quite detailed, but here's a tiny snippet focusing on the response format rule:
 66: 
 67: ```markdown
 68: # Response Rules
 69: 1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
 70: {{"current_state": {{"evaluation_previous_goal": "...",
 71: "memory": "...",
 72: "next_goal": "..."}},
 73: "action":[{{"one_action_name": {{...}}}}, ...]}}
 74: 
 75: 2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list... Use maximum {{max_actions}} actions...
 76: ```
 77: *(This is heavily simplified! The real file has many more rules about element interaction, error handling, task completion, etc.)*
 78: 
 79: This file clearly defines the JSON structure (`current_state` and `action`) and other crucial behaviors required from the LLM.
 80: 
 81: ## How the Agent Uses the System Prompt
 82: 
 83: The `Agent` uses a helper class called `SystemPrompt` (found in `agent/prompts.py`) to manage these rules. Here's the flow:
 84: 
 85: 1.  **Loading:** When you create an `Agent`, it internally creates a `SystemPrompt` object. This object reads the rules from the `system_prompt.md` file.
 86: 2.  **Formatting:** The `SystemPrompt` object formats these rules into a special `SystemMessage` object that LLMs understand as foundational instructions.
 87: 3.  **Conversation Start:** This `SystemMessage` is given to the [Message Manager](06_message_manager.md), which keeps track of the conversation history with the LLM. The `SystemMessage` becomes the *very first message*, setting the context for all future interactions in that session.
 88: 
 89: Think of it like starting a meeting: the first thing you do is state the agenda and rules (System Prompt), and then the discussion (LLM interaction) follows based on that foundation.
 90: 
 91: Let's look at a simplified view of the `SystemPrompt` class loading the rules:
 92: 
 93: ```python
 94: # --- File: agent/prompts.py (Simplified) ---
 95: import importlib.resources # Helps find files within the installed library
 96: from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage # Special message type for LLMs
 97: 
 98: class SystemPrompt:
 99:     def __init__(self, action_description: str, max_actions_per_step: int = 10):
100:         # We ignore these details for now
101:         self.default_action_description = action_description
102:         self.max_actions_per_step = max_actions_per_step
103:         self._load_prompt_template() # <--- Loads the rules file
104: 
105:     def _load_prompt_template(self) -> None:
106:         """Load the prompt rules from the system_prompt.md file."""
107:         try:
108:             # Finds the 'system_prompt.md' file inside the browser_use package
109:             filepath = importlib.resources.files('browser_use.agent').joinpath('system_prompt.md')
110:             with filepath.open('r') as f:
111:                 self.prompt_template = f.read() # Read the text content
112:             print("System Prompt template loaded successfully!")
113:         except Exception as e:
114:             print(f"Error loading system prompt: {e}")
115:             self.prompt_template = "Error: Could not load prompt." # Fallback
116: 
117:     def get_system_message(self) -> SystemMessage:
118:         """Format the loaded rules into a message for the LLM."""
119:         # Replace placeholders like {{max_actions}} with actual values
120:         prompt = self.prompt_template.format(max_actions=self.max_actions_per_step)
121:         # Wrap the final rules text in a SystemMessage object
122:         return SystemMessage(content=prompt)
123: 
124: # --- How it plugs into Agent creation (Conceptual) ---
125: # from browser_use import Agent, SystemPrompt
126: # from my_llm_setup import my_llm # Your LLM
127: # ... other setup ...
128: 
129: # When you create an Agent:
130: # agent = Agent(
131: #     task="Find cat pictures",
132: #     llm=my_llm,
133: #     browser_context=...,
134: #     controller=...,
135: #     # The Agent's __init__ method does something like this internally:
136: #     # system_prompt_obj = SystemPrompt(action_description="...", max_actions_per_step=10)
137: #     # system_message_for_llm = system_prompt_obj.get_system_message()
138: #     # This system_message_for_llm is then passed to the Message Manager.
139: # )
140: ```
141: 
142: This code shows how the `SystemPrompt` class finds and reads the `system_prompt.md` file and prepares the instructions as a `SystemMessage` ready for the LLM conversation.
143: 
144: ## Under the Hood: Initialization and Conversation Flow
145: 
146: Let's visualize how the System Prompt fits into the Agent's setup and interaction loop:
147: 
148: ```mermaid
149: sequenceDiagram
150:     participant User
151:     participant Agent_Init as Agent Initialization
152:     participant SP as SystemPrompt Class
153:     participant MM as Message Manager
154:     participant Agent_Run as Agent Run Loop
155:     participant LLM
156: 
157:     User->>Agent_Init: Create Agent(task, llm, ...)
158:     Note over Agent_Init: Agent needs the rules!
159:     Agent_Init->>SP: Create SystemPrompt(...)
160:     SP->>SP: _load_prompt_template() reads system_prompt.md
161:     SP-->>Agent_Init: SystemPrompt instance
162:     Agent_Init->>SP: get_system_message()
163:     SP-->>Agent_Init: system_message (The Formatted Rules)
164:     Note over Agent_Init: Pass rules to conversation manager
165:     Agent_Init->>MM: Initialize MessageManager(task, system_message)
166:     MM->>MM: Store system_message as message #1
167:     MM-->>Agent_Init: MessageManager instance ready
168:     Agent_Init-->>User: Agent created and ready
169: 
170:     User->>Agent_Run: agent.run() starts the task
171:     Note over Agent_Run: Agent needs context for LLM
172:     Agent_Run->>MM: get_messages()
173:     MM-->>Agent_Run: [system_message, user_message(state), ...]
174:     Note over Agent_Run: Send rules + current state to LLM
175:     Agent_Run->>LLM: Ask for next action (Input includes rules)
176:     LLM-->>Agent_Run: JSON response (LLM followed rules!)
177:     Agent_Run->>MM: add_model_output(...)
178:     Note over Agent_Run: Loop continues...
179: ```
180: 
181: Internally, the `Agent`'s initialization code (`__init__` in `agent/service.py`) explicitly creates the `SystemPrompt` and passes its output to the `MessageManager`:
182: 
183: ```python
184: # --- File: agent/service.py (Simplified Agent __init__) ---
185: # ... other imports ...
186: from browser_use.agent.prompts import SystemPrompt # Import the class
187: from browser_use.agent.message_manager.service import MessageManager, MessageManagerSettings
188: 
189: class Agent:
190:     def __init__(
191:         self,
192:         task: str,
193:         llm: BaseChatModel,
194:         browser_context: BrowserContext,
195:         controller: Controller,
196:         system_prompt_class: Type[SystemPrompt] = SystemPrompt, # Allows customizing the prompt class
197:         max_actions_per_step: int = 10,
198:          # ... other parameters ...
199:         **kwargs
200:     ):
201:         self.task = task
202:         self.llm = llm
203:         # ... store other components ...
204: 
205:         # Get the list of available actions from the controller
206:         self.available_actions = controller.registry.get_prompt_description()
207: 
208:         # 1. Create the SystemPrompt instance using the provided class
209:         system_prompt_instance = system_prompt_class(
210:             action_description=self.available_actions,
211:             max_actions_per_step=max_actions_per_step,
212:         )
213: 
214:         # 2. Get the formatted SystemMessage (the rules)
215:         system_message = system_prompt_instance.get_system_message()
216: 
217:         # 3. Initialize the Message Manager with the task and the rules
218:         self._message_manager = MessageManager(
219:             task=self.task,
220:             system_message=system_message, # <--- Pass the rules here!
221:             settings=MessageManagerSettings(...)
222:             # ... other message manager setup ...
223:         )
224:         # ... rest of initialization ...
225:         logger.info("Agent initialized with System Prompt.")
226: ```
227: 
228: When the `Agent` runs its loop (`agent.run()` calls `agent.step()`), it asks the `MessageManager` for the current conversation history (`self._message_manager.get_messages()`). The `MessageManager` always ensures that the `SystemMessage` (containing the rules) is the very first item in that history list sent to the LLM.
229: 
230: ## Conclusion
231: 
232: The System Prompt is the essential rulebook that governs the LLM's behavior within the `Browser Use` framework. It tells the LLM how to interpret the browser state, what actions it can take, and most importantly, dictates the exact JSON format for its responses. This structured communication is key to enabling the `Agent` to reliably understand the LLM's plan and execute browser automation tasks.
233: 
234: Without a clear System Prompt, the LLM would be like an untrained assistant – potentially intelligent, but unable to follow the specific procedures needed for the job.
235: 
236: Now that we understand how the `Agent` gets its fundamental instructions, how does it actually perceive the webpage it's supposed to interact with? In the next chapter, we'll explore the component responsible for representing the browser's state: the [BrowserContext](03_browsercontext.md).

  8: # Chapter 3: BrowserContext - The Agent's Isolated Workspace
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](02_system_prompt.md), we learned how the `System Prompt` acts as the rulebook for the AI assistant (LLM) that guides our `Agent`. We know the Agent uses the LLM to decide *what* to do next based on the current situation in the browser.
 11: 
 12: But *where* does the Agent actually "see" the webpage and perform its actions? How does it keep track of the current website address (URL), the page content, and things like cookies, all while staying focused on its specific task without getting mixed up with your other browsing?
 13: 
 14: This is where the **BrowserContext** comes in.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Does BrowserContext Solve?
 17: 
 18: Imagine you ask your `Agent` to log into a specific online shopping website and check your order status. You might already be logged into that same website in your regular browser window with your personal account.
 19: 
 20: If the Agent just used your main browser window, it might:
 21: 1.  Get confused by your existing login.
 22: 2.  Accidentally use your personal cookies or saved passwords.
 23: 3.  Interfere with other tabs you have open.
 24: 
 25: We need a way to give the Agent its *own*, clean, separate browsing environment for each task. It needs an isolated "workspace" where it can open websites, log in, click buttons, and manage its own cookies without affecting anything else.
 26: 
 27: The `BrowserContext` solves this by representing a single, isolated browser session.
 28: 
 29: ## Meet the BrowserContext: Your Agent's Private Browser Window
 30: 
 31: Think of a `BrowserContext` like opening a brand new **Incognito Window** or creating a **separate User Profile** in your web browser (like Chrome or Firefox).
 32: 
 33: *   **It's Isolated:** What happens in one `BrowserContext` doesn't affect others or your main browser session. It has its own cookies, its own history (for that session), and its own set of tabs.
 34: *   **It Manages State:** It keeps track of everything important about the current web session the Agent is working on:
 35:     *   The current URL.
 36:     *   Which tabs are open within its "window".
 37:     *   Cookies specific to that session.
 38:     *   The structure and content of the current webpage (the DOM - Document Object Model, which we'll explore in the [next chapter](04_dom_representation.md)).
 39: *   **It's the Agent's Viewport:** The `Agent` looks through the `BrowserContext` to "see" the current state of the webpage. When the Agent decides to perform an action (like clicking a button), it tells the [Action Controller](05_action_controller___registry.md) to perform it *within* that specific `BrowserContext`.
 40: 
 41: Essentially, the `BrowserContext` is like a dedicated, clean desk or workspace given to the Agent for its specific job.
 42: 
 43: ## Using the BrowserContext
 44: 
 45: Before we can have an isolated session (`BrowserContext`), we first need the main browser application itself. This is handled by the `Browser` class. Think of `Browser` as the entire Chrome or Firefox application installed on your computer, while `BrowserContext` is just one window or profile within that application.
 46: 
 47: Here's a simplified example of how you might set up a `Browser` and then create a `BrowserContext` to navigate to a page:
 48: 
 49: ```python
 50: import asyncio
 51: # Import necessary classes
 52: from browser_use import Browser, BrowserConfig, BrowserContext, BrowserContextConfig
 53: 
 54: async def main():
 55:     # 1. Configure the main browser application (optional, defaults are usually fine)
 56:     browser_config = BrowserConfig(headless=False) # Show the browser window
 57: 
 58:     # 2. Create the main Browser instance
 59:     # This might launch a browser application in the background (or connect to one)
 60:     browser = Browser(config=browser_config)
 61:     print("Browser application instance created.")
 62: 
 63:     # 3. Configure the specific session/window (optional)
 64:     context_config = BrowserContextConfig(
 65:         user_agent="MyCoolAgent/1.0", # Example: Set a custom user agent
 66:         cookies_file="my_session_cookies.json" # Example: Save/load cookies
 67:     )
 68: 
 69:     # 4. Create the isolated BrowserContext (like opening an incognito window)
 70:     # We use 'async with' to ensure it cleans up automatically afterwards
 71:     async with browser.new_context(config=context_config) as browser_context:
 72:         print(f"BrowserContext created (ID: {browser_context.context_id}).")
 73: 
 74:         # 5. Use the context to interact with the browser session
 75:         start_url = "https://example.com"
 76:         print(f"Navigating to: {start_url}")
 77:         await browser_context.navigate_to(start_url)
 78: 
 79:         # 6. Get information *from* the context
 80:         current_state = await browser_context.get_state() # Get current page info
 81:         print(f"Current page title: {current_state.title}")
 82:         print(f"Current page URL: {current_state.url}")
 83: 
 84:         # The Agent would use this 'browser_context' object to see the page
 85:         # and tell the Controller to perform actions within it.
 86: 
 87:     print("BrowserContext closed automatically.")
 88: 
 89:     # 7. Close the main browser application when done
 90:     await browser.close()
 91:     print("Browser application closed.")
 92: 
 93: # Run the asynchronous code
 94: asyncio.run(main())
 95: ```
 96: 
 97: **What happens here?**
 98: 
 99: 1.  We set up a `BrowserConfig` (telling it *not* to run headless so we can see the window).
100: 2.  We create a `Browser` instance, which represents the overall browser program.
101: 3.  We create a `BrowserContextConfig` to specify settings for our isolated session (like a custom name or where to save cookies).
102: 4.  Crucially, `browser.new_context(...)` creates our isolated session. The `async with` block ensures this session is properly closed later.
103: 5.  We use methods *on the `browser_context` object* like `navigate_to()` to control *this specific session*.
104: 6.  We use `browser_context.get_state()` to get information about the current page within *this session*. The `Agent` heavily relies on this method.
105: 7.  After the `async with` block finishes, the `browser_context` is closed (like closing the incognito window), and finally, we close the main `browser` application.
106: 
107: ## How it Works Under the Hood
108: 
109: When the `Agent` needs to understand the current situation to decide the next step, it asks the `BrowserContext` for the latest state using the `get_state()` method. What happens then?
110: 
111: 1.  **Wait for Stability:** The `BrowserContext` first waits for the webpage to finish loading and for network activity to settle down (`_wait_for_page_and_frames_load`). This prevents the Agent from acting on an incomplete page.
112: 2.  **Analyze the Page:** It then uses the [DOM Representation](04_dom_representation.md) service (`DomService`) to analyze the current HTML structure of the page. This service figures out which elements are visible, interactive (buttons, links, input fields), and where they are.
113: 3.  **Capture Visuals:** It often takes a screenshot of the current view (`take_screenshot`). This can be helpful for advanced agents or debugging.
114: 4.  **Gather Metadata:** It gets the current URL, page title, and information about any other tabs open *within this context*.
115: 5.  **Package the State:** All this information (DOM structure, URL, title, screenshot, etc.) is bundled into a `BrowserState` object.
116: 6.  **Return to Agent:** The `BrowserContext` returns this `BrowserState` object to the `Agent`. The Agent then uses this information (often sending it to the LLM) to plan its next action.
117: 
118: Here's a simplified diagram of the `get_state()` process:
119: 
120: ```mermaid
121: sequenceDiagram
122:     participant Agent
123:     participant BC as BrowserContext

126: 
127:     Agent->>BC: get_state()
128:     Note over BC: Wait for page to be ready...
129:     BC->>PlaywrightPage: Ensure page/network is stable

137:     BC->>PlaywrightPage: Get URL, Title
138:     PlaywrightPage-->>BC: URL, Title data
139:     Note over BC: Combine everything...
140:     BC->>BC: Create BrowserState object
141:     BC-->>Agent: Return BrowserState
142: ```
143: 
144: Let's look at some simplified code snippets from the library.
145: 
146: The `BrowserContext` is initialized (`__init__` in `browser/context.py`) with its configuration and a reference to the main `Browser` instance that created it.
147: 
148: ```python
149: # --- File: browser/context.py (Simplified __init__) ---
150: import uuid
151: # ... other imports ...
152: if TYPE_CHECKING:
153:     from browser_use.browser.browser import Browser # Link to the Browser class
154: 
155: @dataclass
156: class BrowserContextConfig: # Configuration settings
157:     # ... various settings like user_agent, cookies_file, window_size ...
158:     pass
159: 
160: @dataclass
161: class BrowserSession: # Holds the actual Playwright context
162:     context: PlaywrightBrowserContext # The underlying Playwright object
163:     cached_state: Optional[BrowserState] = None # Stores the last known state
164: 
165: class BrowserContext:
166:     def __init__(
167:         self,
168:         browser: 'Browser', # Reference to the main Browser instance
169:         config: BrowserContextConfig = BrowserContextConfig(),
170:         # ... other optional state ...
171:     ):
172:         self.context_id = str(uuid.uuid4()) # Unique ID for this session
173:         self.config = config # Store the configuration
174:         self.browser = browser # Store the reference to the parent Browser
175: 
176:         # The actual Playwright session is created later, when needed
177:         self.session: BrowserSession | None = None
178:         logger.debug(f"BrowserContext object created (ID: {self.context_id}). Session not yet initialized.")
179: 
180:     # The 'async with' statement calls __aenter__ which initializes the session
181:     async def __aenter__(self):
182:         await self._initialize_session() # Creates the actual browser window/tab
183:         return self
184: 
185:     async def _initialize_session(self):
186:         # ... (complex setup code happens here) ...
187:         # Gets the main Playwright browser from self.browser
188:         playwright_browser = await self.browser.get_playwright_browser()
189:         # Creates the isolated Playwright context (like the incognito window)
190:         context = await self._create_context(playwright_browser)
191:         # Creates the BrowserSession to hold the context and state
192:         self.session = BrowserSession(context=context, cached_state=None)
193:         logger.debug(f"BrowserContext session initialized (ID: {self.context_id}).")
194:         # ... (sets up the initial page) ...
195:         return self.session
196: 
197:     # ... other methods like navigate_to, close, etc. ...
198: ```
199: 
200: The `get_state` method orchestrates fetching the current information from the browser session.
201: 
202: ```python
203: # --- File: browser/context.py (Simplified get_state and helpers) ---
204: # ... other imports ...
205: from browser_use.dom.service import DomService # Imports the DOM analyzer
206: from browser_use.browser.views import BrowserState # Imports the state structure
207: 
208: class BrowserContext:
209:     # ... (init, aenter, etc.) ...
210: 
211:     async def get_state(self) -> BrowserState:
212:         """Get the current state of the browser session."""
213:         logger.debug(f"Getting state for context {self.context_id}...")
214:         # 1. Make sure the page is loaded and stable
215:         await self._wait_for_page_and_frames_load()
216: 
217:         # 2. Get the actual Playwright session object
218:         session = await self.get_session()

288: This shows how `BrowserContext` acts as a manager for a specific browser session, using underlying tools (like Playwright and `DomService`) to gather the necessary information (`BrowserState`) that the `Agent` needs to operate.
289: 
290: ## Conclusion
291: 
292: The `BrowserContext` is a fundamental concept in `Browser Use`. It provides the necessary **isolated environment** for the `Agent` to perform its tasks, much like an incognito window or a separate browser profile. It manages the session's state (URL, cookies, tabs, page content) and provides the `Agent` with a snapshot of the current situation via the `get_state()` method.
293: 
294: Understanding the `BrowserContext` helps clarify *where* the Agent works. Now, how does the Agent actually understand the *content* of the webpage within that context? How is the complex structure of a webpage represented in a way the Agent (and the LLM) can understand?
295: 
296: In the next chapter, we'll dive into exactly that: the [DOM Representation](04_dom_representation.md).

  8: # Chapter 4: DOM Representation - Mapping the Webpage
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](03_browsercontext.md), we learned about the `BrowserContext`, the Agent's private workspace for browsing. We saw that the Agent uses `browser_context.get_state()` to get a snapshot of the current webpage. But how does the Agent actually *understand* the content of that snapshot?
 11: 
 12: Imagine you're looking at the Google homepage. You instantly recognize the logo, the search bar, and the buttons. But a computer program just sees a wall of code (HTML). How can our `Agent` figure out: "This rectangular box is the search bar I need to type into," or "This specific image link is the first result I should click"?
 13: 
 14: This is the problem solved by **DOM Representation**.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Does DOM Representation Solve?
 17: 
 18: Webpages are built using HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which describes the structure and content. Your browser reads this HTML and creates an internal, structured representation called the **Document Object Model (DOM)**. It's like the browser builds a detailed blueprint or an outline from the HTML instructions.
 19: 
 20: However, this raw DOM blueprint is incredibly complex and contains lots of information irrelevant to our Agent's task. The Agent doesn't need to know about every single tiny visual detail; it needs a *simplified map* focused on what's important for interaction:
 21: 
 22: 1.  **What elements are on the page?** (buttons, links, input fields, text)
 23: 2.  **Are they visible to a user?** (Hidden elements shouldn't be interacted with)
 24: 3.  **Are they interactive?** (Can you click it? Can you type in it?)
 25: 4.  **How can the Agent refer to them?** (We need a simple way to say "click *this* button")
 26: 
 27: DOM Representation solves the problem of translating the complex, raw DOM blueprint into a simplified, structured map that highlights the interactive "landmarks" and pathways the Agent can use.
 28: 
 29: ## Meet `DomService`: The Map Maker
 30: 
 31: The component responsible for creating this map is the `DomService`. Think of it as a cartographer specializing in webpages.
 32: 
 33: When the `Agent` (via the `BrowserContext`) asks for the current state of the page, the `BrowserContext` employs the `DomService` to analyze the page's live DOM.
 34: 
 35: Here's what the `DomService` does:
 36: 
 37: 1.  **Examines the Live Page:** It looks at the current structure rendered in the browser tab, not just the initial HTML source code (because JavaScript can change the page after it loads).
 38: 2.  **Identifies Elements:** It finds all the meaningful elements like buttons, links, input fields, and text blocks.
 39: 3.  **Checks Properties:** For each element, it determines crucial properties:
 40:     *   **Visibility:** Is it actually displayed on the screen?
 41:     *   **Interactivity:** Is it something a user can click, type into, or otherwise interact with?
 42:     *   **Position:** Where is it located (roughly)?
 43: 4.  **Assigns Interaction Indices:** This is key! For elements deemed interactive and visible, `DomService` assigns a unique number, called a `highlight_index` (like `[5]`, `[12]`, etc.). This gives the Agent and the LLM a simple, unambiguous way to refer to specific elements.
 44: 5.  **Builds a Structured Tree:** It organizes this information into a simplified tree structure (`element_tree`) that reflects the page layout but is much easier to process than the full DOM.
 45: 6.  **Creates an Index Map:** It generates a `selector_map`, which is like an index in a book, mapping each `highlight_index` directly to its corresponding element node in the tree.
 46: 
 47: The final output is a `DOMState` object containing the simplified `element_tree` and the handy `selector_map`. This `DOMState` is then included in the `BrowserState` that `BrowserContext.get_state()` returns to the Agent.
 48: 
 49: ## The Output: `DOMState` - The Agent's Map
 50: 
 51: The `DOMState` object produced by `DomService` has two main parts:
 52: 
 53: 1.  **`element_tree`:** This is the root of our simplified map, represented as a `DOMElementNode` object (defined in `dom/views.py`). Each node in the tree can be either an element (`DOMElementNode`) or a piece of text (`DOMTextNode`). `DOMElementNode`s contain information like the tag name (`<button>`, `<input>`), attributes (`aria-label="Search"`), visibility, interactivity, and importantly, the `highlight_index` if applicable. The tree structure helps understand the page layout (e.g., this button is inside that section).
 54: 
 55:     *Conceptual Example Tree:*
 56:     ```
 57:     <body> [no index]
 58:      |-- <div> [no index]
 59:      |    |-- <input aria-label="Search"> [highlight_index: 5]
 60:      |    +-- <button> [highlight_index: 6]
 61:      |         +-- "Google Search" (TextNode)
 62:      +-- <a> href="/images"> [highlight_index: 7]
 63:           +-- "Images" (TextNode)
 64:     ```
 65: 
 66: 2.  **`selector_map`:** This is a Python dictionary that acts as a quick lookup. It maps the integer `highlight_index` directly to the corresponding `DOMElementNode` object in the `element_tree`.
 67: 
 68:     *Conceptual Example Map:*
 69:     ```python
 70:     {
 71:         5: <DOMElementNode tag_name='input', attributes={'aria-label':'Search'}, ...>,
 72:         6: <DOMElementNode tag_name='button', ...>,
 73:         7: <DOMElementNode tag_name='a', attributes={'href':'/images'}, ...>
 74:     }
 75:     ```
 76: 
 77: This `selector_map` is incredibly useful because when the LLM decides "click element 5", the Agent can instantly find the correct `DOMElementNode` using `selector_map[5]` and tell the [Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md) exactly which element to interact with.
 78: 
 79: ## How the Agent Uses the Map
 80: 
 81: The `Agent` takes the `DOMState` (usually simplifying the `element_tree` further into a text representation) and includes it in the information sent to the LLM. Remember the JSON response format from [Chapter 2](02_system_prompt.md)? The LLM uses the `highlight_index` from this map to specify actions:
 82: 
 83: ```json
 84: // LLM might receive a simplified text view like:
 85: // "[5]<input aria-label='Search'>\n[6]<button>Google Search</button>\n[7]<a>Images</a>"
 86: 
 87: // And respond with:
 88: {
 89:   "current_state": {
 90:     "evaluation_previous_goal": "...",
 91:     "memory": "On Google homepage, need to search for cats.",
 92:     "next_goal": "Type 'cute cats' into the search bar [5]."
 93:   },
 94:   "action": [
 95:     {
 96:       "input_text": {
 97:         "index": 5, // <-- Uses the highlight_index from the DOM map!
 98:         "text": "cute cats"
 99:       }
100:     }
101:     // ... maybe press Enter action ...
102:   ]
103: }
104: ```
105: 
106: ## Code Example: Seeing the Map
107: 
108: We don't usually interact with `DomService` directly. Instead, we get its output via the `BrowserContext`. Let's revisit the example from Chapter 3 and see where the DOM representation fits:
109: 
110: ```python
111: import asyncio
112: from browser_use import Browser, BrowserConfig, BrowserContext, BrowserContextConfig
113: 
114: async def main():
115:     browser_config = BrowserConfig(headless=False)
116:     browser = Browser(config=browser_config)
117:     context_config = BrowserContextConfig()
118: 
119:     async with browser.new_context(config=context_config) as browser_context:
120:         # Navigate to a page (e.g., Google)
121:         await browser_context.navigate_to("https://www.google.com")
122: 
123:         print("Getting current page state...")
124:         # This call uses DomService internally to generate the DOM representation
125:         current_state = await browser_context.get_state()
126: 
127:         print(f"\nCurrent Page URL: {current_state.url}")
128:         print(f"Current Page Title: {current_state.title}")
129: 
130:         # Accessing the DOM Representation parts within the BrowserState
131:         print("\n--- DOM Representation Details ---")
132:         # The element_tree is the root node of our simplified DOM map
133:         if current_state.element_tree:
134:             print(f"Root element tag of simplified tree: <{current_state.element_tree.tag_name}>")
135:         else:
136:             print("Element tree is empty.")
137: 
138:         # The selector_map provides direct access to interactive elements by index
139:         if current_state.selector_map:
140:             print(f"Number of interactive elements found: {len(current_state.selector_map)}")
141: 
142:             # Let's try to find the element the LLM might call [5] (often the search bar)
143:             example_index = 5 # Note: Indices can change depending on the page!
144:             if example_index in current_state.selector_map:
145:                 element_node = current_state.selector_map[example_index]
146:                 print(f"Element [{example_index}]: Tag=<{element_node.tag_name}>, Attributes={element_node.attributes}")
147:                 # The Agent uses this node reference to perform actions
148:             else:
149:                 print(f"Element [{example_index}] not found in the selector map for this page state.")
150:         else:
151:             print("No interactive elements found (selector map is empty).")
152: 
153:         # The Agent would typically convert element_tree into a compact text format
154:         # (using methods like element_tree.clickable_elements_to_string())
155:         # to send to the LLM along with the task instructions.
156: 
157:     print("\nBrowserContext closed.")
158:     await browser.close()
159:     print("Browser closed.")
160: 
161: # Run the asynchronous code
162: asyncio.run(main())
163: ```
164: 
165: **What happens here?**
166: 
167: 1.  We set up the `Browser` and `BrowserContext`.
168: 2.  We navigate to Google.
169: 3.  `browser_context.get_state()` is called. **Internally**, this triggers the `DomService`.
170: 4.  `DomService` analyzes the Google page, finds interactive elements (like the search bar, buttons), assigns them `highlight_index` numbers, and builds the `element_tree` and `selector_map`.
171: 5.  This `DOMState` (containing the tree and map) is packaged into the `BrowserState` object returned by `get_state()`.
172: 6.  Our code then accesses `current_state.element_tree` and `current_state.selector_map` to peek at the map created by `DomService`.
173: 7.  We demonstrate looking up an element using its potential index (`selector_map[5]`).
174: 
175: ## How It Works Under the Hood: `DomService` in Action
176: 
177: Let's trace the flow when `BrowserContext.get_state()` is called:
178: 
179: ```mermaid
180: sequenceDiagram
181:     participant Agent

186:

203:     BC-->>Agent: Return BrowserState (containing DOM map)
204: ```
205: 
206: **Key Code Points:**
207: 
208: 1.  **`BrowserContext` calls `DomService`:** Inside `browser/context.py`, the `_update_state` method (called by `get_state`) initializes and uses the `DomService`:
209: 
210:     ```python
211:     # --- File: browser/context.py (Simplified _update_state) ---
212:     from browser_use.dom.service import DomService # Import the service
213:     from browser_use.browser.views import BrowserState
214: 
215:     class BrowserContext:
216:         # ... other methods ...
217:         async def _update_state(self) -> BrowserState:
218:             page = await self.get_current_page() # Get the active Playwright page object
219:             # ... error handling ...
220:             try:
221:                 # 1. Create DomService instance for the current page
222:                 dom_service = DomService(page)
223: 
224:                 # 2. Call DomService to get the DOM map (DOMState)
225:                 content_info = await dom_service.get_clickable_elements(
226:                     highlight_elements=self.config.highlight_elements,
227:                     viewport_expansion=self.config.viewport_expansion,
228:                     # ... other options ...
229:                 )
230: 
231:                 # 3. Get other info (screenshot, URL, title etc.)
232:                 screenshot_b64 = await self.take_screenshot()
233:                 url = page.url
234:                 title = await page.title()
235:                 # ... gather more state ...
236: 
237:                 # 4. Package everything into BrowserState
238:                 browser_state = BrowserState(
239:                     element_tree=content_info.element_tree, # <--- From DomService
240:                     selector_map=content_info.selector_map, # <--- From DomService
241:                     url=url,
242:                     title=title,
243:                     screenshot=screenshot_b64,
244:                     # ... other state info ...
245:                 )
246:                 return browser_state
247:             except Exception as e:
248:                 logger.error(f'Failed to update state: {str(e)}')
249:                 raise # Or handle error
250:     ```
251: 
252: 2.  **`DomService` runs JavaScript:** Inside `dom/service.py`, the `_build_dom_tree` method executes the JavaScript code stored in `buildDomTree.js` within the browser page's context.
253: 
254:     ```python
255:     # --- File: dom/service.py (Simplified _build_dom_tree) ---
256:     import logging
257:     from importlib import resources
258:     # ... other imports ...
259: 
260:     logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
261:

305:     ```
306: 
307: 3.  **`buildDomTree.js` (Conceptual):** This JavaScript file (located at `dom/buildDomTree.js` in the library) is the core map-making logic that runs *inside the browser*. It traverses the live DOM, checks element visibility and interactivity using browser APIs (like `element.getBoundingClientRect()`, `window.getComputedStyle()`, `document.elementFromPoint()`), assigns the `highlight_index`, and packages the results into a structured format that the Python `DomService` can understand. *We don't need to understand the JS code itself, just its purpose.*
308: 
309: 4.  **Python Data Structures (`DOMElementNode`, `DOMTextNode`):** The results from the JavaScript are parsed into Python objects defined in `dom/views.py`. These dataclasses (`DOMElementNode`, `DOMTextNode`) hold the information about each mapped element or text segment.
310: 
311: ## Conclusion
312: 
313: DOM Representation, primarily handled by the `DomService`, is crucial for bridging the gap between the complex reality of a webpage (the DOM) and the Agent/LLM's need for a simplified, actionable understanding. By creating a structured `element_tree` and an indexed `selector_map`, it provides a clear map of interactive landmarks on the page, identified by simple `highlight_index` numbers.
314: 
315: This map allows the LLM to make specific plans like "type into element [5]" or "click element [12]", which the Agent can then reliably translate into concrete actions.
316: 
317: Now that we understand how the Agent sees the page, how does it actually *perform* those actions like clicking or typing? In the next chapter, we'll explore the component responsible for executing the LLM's plan: the [Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md).

  8: # Chapter 5: Action Controller & Registry - The Agent's Hands and Toolbox
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](04_dom_representation.md), we saw how the `DomService` creates a simplified map (`DOMState`) of the webpage, allowing the Agent and its LLM planner to identify interactive elements like buttons and input fields using unique numbers (`highlight_index`). The LLM uses this map to decide *what* specific action to take next, like "click element [5]" or "type 'hello world' into element [12]".
 11: 
 12: But how does the program actually *do* that? How does the abstract idea "click element [5]" turn into a real click inside the browser window managed by the [BrowserContext](03_browsercontext.md)?
 13: 
 14: This is where the **Action Controller** and **Action Registry** come into play. They are the "hands" and "toolbox" that execute the Agent's decisions.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Do They Solve?
 17: 
 18: Imagine you have a detailed instruction manual (the LLM's plan) for building a model car. The manual tells you exactly which piece to pick up (`index=5`) and what to do with it ("click" or "attach"). However, you still need:
 19: 
 20: 1.  **A Toolbox:** A collection of all the tools you might need (screwdriver, glue, pliers). You need to know what tools are available.
 21: 2.  **A Mechanic:** Someone (or you!) who can read the instruction ("Use the screwdriver on screw #5"), select the correct tool from the toolbox, and skillfully use it on the specified part.
 22: 
 23: Without the toolbox and the mechanic, the instruction manual is useless.
 24: 
 25: Similarly, the `Browser Use` Agent needs:
 26: 1.  **Action Registry (The Toolbox):** A defined list of all possible actions the Agent can perform (e.g., `click_element`, `input_text`, `scroll_down`, `go_to_url`, `done`). This registry also holds details about each action, like what parameters it needs (e.g., `click_element` needs an `index`).
 27: 2.  **Action Controller (The Mechanic):** A component that takes the specific action requested by the LLM (e.g., "execute `click_element` with `index=5`"), finds the corresponding function (the "tool") in the Registry, ensures the request is valid, and then executes that function using the [BrowserContext](03_browsercontext.md) (the "car").
 28: 
 29: The Controller and Registry solve the problem of translating the LLM's high-level plan into concrete, executable browser operations in a structured and reliable way.
 30: 
 31: ## Meet the Toolbox and the Mechanic
 32: 
 33: Let's break down these two closely related concepts:
 34: 
 35: ### 1. Action Registry: The Toolbox (`controller/registry/service.py`)
 36: 
 37: Think of the `Registry` as a carefully organized toolbox. Each drawer is labeled with the name of a tool (an action like `click_element`), and inside, you find the tool itself (the actual code function) along with its instructions (description and required parameters).
 38: 
 39: *   **Catalog of Actions:** It holds a dictionary where keys are action names (strings like `"click_element"`) and values are `RegisteredAction` objects containing:
 40:     *   The action's `name`.
 41:     *   A `description` (for humans and the LLM).
 42:     *   The actual Python `function` to call.
 43:     *   A `param_model` (a Pydantic model defining required parameters like `index` or `text`).
 44: *   **Informs the LLM:** The `Registry` can generate a description of all available actions and their parameters. This description is given to the LLM (as part of the [System Prompt](02_system_prompt.md)) so it knows exactly what "tools" it's allowed to ask the Agent to use.
 45: 
 46: ### 2. Action Controller: The Mechanic (`controller/service.py`)
 47: 
 48: The `Controller` is the skilled mechanic who uses the tools from the Registry.
 49: 
 50: *   **Receives Instructions:** It gets the action request from the Agent. This request typically comes in the form of an `ActionModel` object, which represents the LLM's JSON output (e.g., `{"click_element": {"index": 5}}`).
 51: *   **Selects the Tool:** It looks at the `ActionModel`, identifies the action name (`"click_element"`), and retrieves the corresponding `RegisteredAction` from the `Registry`.
 52: *   **Validates Parameters:** It uses the action's `param_model` (e.g., `ClickElementAction`) to check if the provided parameters (`{"index": 5}`) are correct.
 53: *   **Executes the Action:** It calls the actual Python function associated with the action (e.g., the `click_element` function), passing it the validated parameters and the necessary `BrowserContext` (so the function knows *which* browser tab to act upon).
 54: *   **Reports the Result:** The action function performs the task (e.g., clicking the element) and returns an `ActionResult` object, indicating whether it succeeded, failed, or produced some output. The Controller passes this result back to the Agent.
 55: 
 56: ## Using the Controller: Executing an Action
 57: 
 58: In the Agent's main loop ([Chapter 1: Agent](01_agent.md)), after the LLM provides its plan as an `ActionModel`, the Agent simply hands this model over to the `Controller` to execute it.
 59: 
 60: ```python
 61: # --- Simplified Agent step calling the Controller ---
 62: # Assume 'llm_response_model' is the ActionModel object parsed from LLM's JSON
 63: # Assume 'self.controller' is the Controller instance
 64: # Assume 'self.browser_context' is the current BrowserContext
 65: 
 66: # ... inside the Agent's step method ...
 67: 
 68: try:
 69:     # Agent tells the Controller: "Execute this action!"
 70:     action_result: ActionResult = await self.controller.act(
 71:         action=llm_response_model,      # The LLM's chosen action and parameters
 72:         browser_context=self.browser_context # The browser tab to act within
 73:         # Other context like LLMs for extraction might be passed too
 74:     )
 75: 
 76:     # Agent receives the result from the Controller
 77:     print(f"Action executed. Result: {action_result.extracted_content}")
 78:     if action_result.is_done:
 79:         print("Task marked as done by the action!")
 80:     if action_result.error:
 81:         print(f"Action encountered an error: {action_result.error}")
 82: 
 83:     # Agent records this result in the history ([Message Manager](06_message_manager.md))
 84:     # ...
 85: 
 86: except Exception as e:
 87:     print(f"Failed to execute action: {e}")
 88:     # Handle the error
 89: ```
 90: 
 91: **What happens here?**
 92: 
 93: 1.  The Agent has received `llm_response_model` (e.g., representing `{"click_element": {"index": 5}}`).
 94: 2.  It calls `self.controller.act()`, passing the action model and the active `browser_context`.
 95: 3.  The `controller.act()` method handles looking up the `"click_element"` function in the `Registry`, validating the `index` parameter, and calling the function to perform the click within the `browser_context`.
 96: 4.  The `click_element` function executes (interacting with the browser via `BrowserContext` methods).
 97: 5.  It returns an `ActionResult` (e.g., `ActionResult(extracted_content="Clicked button with index 5")`).
 98: 6.  The Agent receives this `action_result` and proceeds.
 99: 
100: ## How it Works Under the Hood: The Execution Flow
101: 
102: Let's trace the journey of an action request from the Agent to the browser click:
103: 
104: ```mermaid
105: sequenceDiagram
106:     participant Agent
107:     participant Controller
108:     participant Registry
109:     participant ClickFunc as click_element Function
110:     participant BC as BrowserContext
111: 
112:     Note over Agent: LLM decided: click_element(index=5)
113:     Agent->>Controller: act(action={"click_element": {"index": 5}}, browser_context=BC)
114:     Note over Controller: Identify action and params
115:     Controller->>Controller: action_name = "click_element", params = {"index": 5}
116:     Note over Controller: Ask Registry for the tool
117:     Controller->>Registry: Get action definition for "click_element"
118:     Registry-->>Controller: Return RegisteredAction(name="click_element", function=ClickFunc, param_model=ClickElementAction, ...)
119:     Note over Controller: Validate params using param_model
120:     Controller->>Controller: ClickElementAction(index=5) # Validation OK
121:     Note over Controller: Execute the function
122:     Controller->>ClickFunc: ClickFunc(params=ClickElementAction(index=5), browser=BC)
123:     Note over ClickFunc: Perform the click via BrowserContext
124:     ClickFunc->>BC: Find element with index 5
125:     BC-->>ClickFunc: Element reference
126:     ClickFunc->>BC: Execute click on element
127:     BC-->>ClickFunc: Click successful
128:     ClickFunc-->>Controller: Return ActionResult(extracted_content="Clicked button...")
129:     Controller-->>Agent: Return ActionResult
130: ```
131: 
132: This diagram shows the Controller orchestrating the process: receiving the request, consulting the Registry, validating, calling the specific action function, and returning the result.
133: 
134: ## Diving Deeper into the Code
135: 
136: Let's peek at simplified versions of the key files.
137: 
138: ### 1. Registering Actions (`controller/registry/service.py`)
139: 
140: Actions are typically registered using a decorator `@registry.action`.
141: 
142: ```python
143: # --- File: controller/registry/service.py (Simplified Registry) ---
144: from typing import Callable, Type
145: from pydantic import BaseModel
146: # Assume ActionModel, RegisteredAction are defined in views.py
147: 
148: class Registry:
149:     def __init__(self, exclude_actions: list[str] = []):
150:         self.registry: dict[str, RegisteredAction] = {}
151:         self.exclude_actions = exclude_actions
152:         # ... other initializations ...
153: 
154:     def _create_param_model(self, function: Callable) -> Type[BaseModel]:
155:         """Creates a Pydantic model from function signature (simplified)"""
156:         # ... (Inspects function signature to build a model) ...
157:         # Example: for func(index: int, text: str), creates a model
158:         # class func_parameters(ActionModel):
159:         #      index: int
160:         #      text: str
161:         # return func_parameters
162:         pass # Placeholder for complex logic
163: 
164:     def action(
165:         self,
166:         description: str,
167:         param_model: Type[BaseModel] | None = None,
168:     ):
169:         """Decorator for registering actions"""
170:         def decorator(func: Callable):
171:             if func.__name__ in self.exclude_actions: return func # Skip excluded
172: 
173:             # If no specific param_model provided, try to generate one
174:             actual_param_model = param_model # Or self._create_param_model(func) if needed
175: 
176:             # Ensure function is awaitable (async)
177:             wrapped_func = func # Assume func is already async for simplicity
178: 
179:             action = RegisteredAction(
180:                 name=func.__name__,
181:                 description=description,
182:                 function=wrapped_func,
183:                 param_model=actual_param_model,
184:             )
185:             self.registry[func.__name__] = action # Add to the toolbox!
186:             print(f"Action '{func.__name__}' registered.")
187:             return func
188:         return decorator
189: 
190:     def get_prompt_description(self) -> str:
191:         """Get a description of all actions for the prompt (simplified)"""
192:         descriptions = []
193:         for action in self.registry.values():
194:              # Format description for LLM (e.g., "click_element: Click element {index: {'type': 'integer'}}")
195:              descriptions.append(f"{action.name}: {action.description} {action.param_model.schema()}")
196:         return "\n".join(descriptions)
197: 
198:     async def execute_action(self, action_name: str, params: dict, browser, **kwargs) -> Any:
199:          """Execute a registered action (simplified)"""
200:          if action_name not in self.registry:
201:              raise ValueError(f"Action {action_name} not found")
202: 
203:          action = self.registry[action_name]
204:          try:
205:              # Validate params using the registered Pydantic model
206:              validated_params = action.param_model(**params)
207: 
208:              # Call the actual action function with validated params and browser context
209:              # Assumes function takes validated_params model and browser
210:              result = await action.function(validated_params, browser=browser, **kwargs)
211:              return result
212:          except Exception as e:
213:              raise RuntimeError(f"Error executing {action_name}: {e}") from e
214: 
215: ```
216: 
217: This shows how the `@registry.action` decorator takes a function, its description, and parameter model, and stores them in the `registry` dictionary. `execute_action` is the core method used by the `Controller` to run a specific action.
218: 
219: ### 2. Defining Action Parameters (`controller/views.py`)
220: 
221: Each action often has its own Pydantic model to define its expected parameters.
222: 
223: ```python
224: # --- File: controller/views.py (Simplified Action Parameter Models) ---
225: from pydantic import BaseModel
226: from typing import Optional
227: 
228: # Example parameter model for the 'click_element' action
229: class ClickElementAction(BaseModel):
230:     index: int              # The highlight_index of the element to click
231:     xpath: Optional[str] = None # Optional hint (usually index is enough)
232: 
233: # Example parameter model for the 'input_text' action
234: class InputTextAction(BaseModel):
235:     index: int              # The highlight_index of the input field
236:     text: str               # The text to type
237:     xpath: Optional[str] = None # Optional hint
238: 
239: # Example parameter model for the 'done' action (task completion)
240: class DoneAction(BaseModel):
241:     text: str               # A final message or result
242:     success: bool           # Was the overall task successful?
243: 
244: # ... other action models like GoToUrlAction, ScrollAction etc. ...
245: ```
246: 
247: These models ensure that when the Controller receives parameters like `{"index": 5}`, it can validate that `index` is indeed an integer as required by `ClickElementAction`.
248: 
249: ### 3. The Controller Service (`controller/service.py`)
250: 
251: The `Controller` class ties everything together. It initializes the `Registry` and registers the default browser actions. Its main job is the `act` method.
252: 
253: ```python
254: # --- File: controller/service.py (Simplified Controller) ---
255: import logging
256: from browser_use.agent.views import ActionModel, ActionResult # Input/Output types
257: from browser_use.browser.context import BrowserContext # Needed by actions
258: from browser_use.controller.registry.service import Registry # The toolbox
259: from browser_use.controller.views import ClickElementAction, InputTextAction, DoneAction # Param models
260: 
261: logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
262: 
263: class Controller:
264:     def __init__(self, exclude_actions: list[str] = []):
265:         self.registry = Registry(exclude_actions=exclude_actions) # Initialize the toolbox
266: 
267:         # --- Register Default Actions ---
268:         # (Registration happens when Controller is created)
269: 
270:         @self.registry.action("Click element", param_model=ClickElementAction)
271:         async def click_element(params: ClickElementAction, browser: BrowserContext):
272:             logger.info(f"Attempting to click element index {params.index}")
273:             # --- Actual click logic using browser object ---
274:             element_node = await browser.get_dom_element_by_index(params.index)
275:             await browser._click_element_node(element_node) # Internal browser method
276:             # ---
277:             msg = f"🖱️ Clicked element with index {params.index}"
278:             return ActionResult(extracted_content=msg, include_in_memory=True)
279: 
280:         @self.registry.action("Input text into an element", param_model=InputTextAction)
281:         async def input_text(params: InputTextAction, browser: BrowserContext):
282:             logger.info(f"Attempting to type into element index {params.index}")
283:             # --- Actual typing logic using browser object ---
284:             element_node = await browser.get_dom_element_by_index(params.index)
285:             await browser._input_text_element_node(element_node, params.text) # Internal method

321:                     if isinstance(result, ActionResult): return result
322:                     if isinstance(result, str): return ActionResult(extracted_content=result)
323:                     return ActionResult() # Default empty result if action returned None
324: 
325:             logger.warning("ActionModel had no action to execute.")
326:             return ActionResult(error="No action specified in the model")
327: 
328:         except Exception as e:
329:             logger.error(f"Error during controller.act: {e}", exc_info=True)
330:             return ActionResult(error=str(e)) # Return error in ActionResult
331: ```
332: 
333: The `Controller` registers all the standard browser actions during initialization. The `act` method then dynamically finds and executes the requested action using the `Registry`.
334: 
335: ## Conclusion
336: 
337: The **Action Registry** acts as the definitive catalog or "toolbox" of all operations the `Browser Use` Agent can perform. The **Action Controller** is the "mechanic" that interprets the LLM's plan, selects the appropriate tool from the Registry, and executes it within the specified [BrowserContext](03_browsercontext.md).
338: 
339: Together, they provide a robust and extensible way to translate high-level instructions into low-level browser interactions, forming the crucial link between the Agent's "brain" (LLM planner) and its "hands" (browser manipulation).
340: 
341: Now that we know how actions are chosen and executed, how does the Agent keep track of the conversation with the LLM, including the history of states observed and actions taken? We'll explore this in the next chapter on the [Message Manager](06_message_manager.md).

  8: # Chapter 6: Message Manager - Keeping the Conversation Straight
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](05_action_controller___registry.md), we learned how the `Action Controller` and `Registry` act as the Agent's "hands" and "toolbox", executing the specific actions decided by the LLM planner. But how does the LLM get all the information it needs to make those decisions in the first place? How does the Agent keep track of the ongoing conversation, including what it "saw" on the page and what happened after each action?
 11: 
 12: Imagine you're having a long, multi-step discussion with an assistant about a complex task. If the assistant has a poor memory, they might forget earlier instructions, the current status, or previous results, making it impossible to proceed correctly. LLMs face a similar challenge: they need the conversation history for context, but they have a limited memory (called the "context window").
 13: 
 14: This is the problem the **Message Manager** solves.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Does the Message Manager Solve?
 17: 
 18: The `Agent` needs to have a conversation with the LLM. This conversation isn't just chat; it includes:
 19: 
 20: 1.  **Initial Instructions:** The core rules from the [System Prompt](02_system_prompt.md).
 21: 2.  **The Task:** The overall goal the Agent needs to achieve.
 22: 3.  **Observations:** What the Agent currently "sees" in the browser ([BrowserContext](03_browsercontext.md) state, including the [DOM Representation](04_dom_representation.md)).
 23: 4.  **Action Results:** What happened after the last action was performed ([Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md)).
 24: 5.  **LLM's Plan:** The sequence of actions the LLM decided on.
 25: 
 26: The Message Manager solves several key problems:
 27: 
 28: *   **Organizes History:** It structures the conversation chronologically, keeping track of who said what (System, User/Agent State, AI/LLM Plan).
 29: *   **Formats Messages:** It ensures the browser state, action results, and even images are formatted correctly so the LLM can understand them.
 30: *   **Tracks Size:** It keeps count of the "tokens" (roughly, words or parts of words) used in the conversation history.
 31: *   **Manages Limits:** It helps prevent the conversation history from exceeding the LLM's context window limit, potentially by removing older parts of the conversation if it gets too long.
 32: 
 33: Think of the `MessageManager` as a meticulous secretary for the Agent-LLM conversation. It takes clear, concise notes, presents the current situation accurately, and ensures the conversation doesn't ramble on for too long, keeping everything within the LLM's "attention span".
 34: 
 35: ## Meet the Message Manager: The Conversation Secretary
 36: 
 37: The `MessageManager` (found in `agent/message_manager/service.py`) is responsible for managing the list of messages that are sent to the LLM in each step.
 38: 
 39: Here are its main jobs:
 40: 
 41: 1.  **Initialization:** When the `Agent` starts, the `MessageManager` is created. It immediately adds the foundational messages:
 42:     *   The `SystemMessage` containing the rules from the [System Prompt](02_system_prompt.md).
 43:     *   A `HumanMessage` stating the overall `task`.
 44:     *   Other initial setup messages (like examples or sensitive data placeholders).
 45: 2.  **Adding Browser State:** Before asking the LLM what to do next, the `Agent` gets the current `BrowserState`. It then tells the `MessageManager` to add this information as a `HumanMessage`. This message includes the simplified DOM map, the current URL, and potentially a screenshot (if `use_vision` is enabled). It also includes the results (`ActionResult`) from the *previous* step, so the LLM knows what happened last.
 46: 3.  **Adding LLM Output:** After the LLM responds with its plan (`AgentOutput`), the `Agent` tells the `MessageManager` to add this plan as an `AIMessage`. This typically includes the LLM's reasoning and the list of actions to perform.
 47: 4.  **Adding Action Results (Indirectly):** The results from the `Controller.act` call (`ActionResult`) aren't added as separate messages *after* the action. Instead, they are included in the *next* `HumanMessage` that contains the browser state (see step 2). This keeps the context tight: "Here's the current page, and here's what happened right before we got here."
 48: 5.  **Providing Messages to LLM:** When the `Agent` is ready to call the LLM, it asks the `MessageManager` for the current conversation history (`get_messages()`).
 49: 6.  **Token Management:** Every time a message is added, the `MessageManager` calculates how many tokens it adds (`_count_tokens`) and updates the total. If the total exceeds the limit (`max_input_tokens`), it might trigger a truncation strategy (`cut_messages`) to shorten the history, usually by removing parts of the oldest user state message or removing the image first.
 50: 
 51: ## How the Agent Uses the Message Manager
 52: 
 53: Let's revisit the simplified `Agent.step` method from [Chapter 1](01_agent.md) and highlight the `MessageManager` interactions (using `self._message_manager`):
 54: 
 55: ```python
 56: # --- File: agent/service.py (Simplified step method - Highlighting MessageManager) ---
 57: class Agent:
 58:     # ... (init, run) ...
 59:     async def step(self, step_info: Optional[AgentStepInfo] = None) -> None:
 60:         logger.info(f"📍 Step {self.state.n_steps}")
 61:         state = None
 62:         model_output = None
 63:         result: list[ActionResult] = []
 64: 
 65:         try:
 66:             # 1. Get current state from the browser
 67:             state = await self.browser_context.get_state() # Uses BrowserContext
 68: 
 69:             # 2. Add state + PREVIOUS result to message history via MessageManager
 70:             #    'self.state.last_result' holds the outcome of the *previous* step's action
 71:             self._message_manager.add_state_message(
 72:                 state,
 73:                 self.state.last_result, # Result from previous action
 74:                 step_info,
 75:                 self.settings.use_vision # Tell it whether to include image
 76:             )
 77: 
 78:             # 3. Get the complete, formatted message history for the LLM
 79:             input_messages = self._message_manager.get_messages()
 80: 
 81:             # 4. Get LLM's decision on the next action(s)
 82:             model_output = await self.get_next_action(input_messages) # Calls the LLM
 83: 
 84:             # --- Agent increments step counter ---
 85:             self.state.n_steps += 1
 86: 
 87:             # 5. Remove the potentially large state message before adding the compact AI response
 88:             #    (This is an optimization mentioned in the provided code)
 89:             self._message_manager._remove_last_state_message()
 90: 
 91:             # 6. Add the LLM's response (the plan) to the history
 92:             self._message_manager.add_model_output(model_output)
 93: 
 94:             # 7. Execute the action(s) using the Controller
 95:             result = await self.multi_act(model_output.action) # Uses Controller
 96: 
 97:             # 8. Store the result of THIS action. It will be used in the *next* step's
 98:             #    call to self._message_manager.add_state_message()
 99:             self.state.last_result = result
100: 
101:             # ... (Record step details, handle success/failure) ...
102: 
103:         except Exception as e:
104:             # Handle errors...
105:             result = await self._handle_step_error(e)
106:             self.state.last_result = result
107:         # ... (finally block) ...
108: ```
109: 
110: This flow shows the cycle: add state/previous result -> get messages -> call LLM -> add LLM response -> execute action -> store result for *next* state message.
111: 
112: ## How it Works Under the Hood: Managing the Flow
113: 
114: Let's visualize the key interactions during one step of the Agent loop involving the `MessageManager`:
115: 
116: ```mermaid
117: sequenceDiagram
118:     participant Agent
119:     participant BC as BrowserContext
120:     participant MM as MessageManager
121:     participant LLM
122:     participant Controller
123: 
124:     Note over Agent: Start of step
125:     Agent->>BC: get_state()
126:     BC-->>Agent: Current BrowserState (DOM map, URL, screenshot?)
127:     Note over Agent: Have BrowserState and `last_result` from previous step
128:     Agent->>MM: add_state_message(BrowserState, last_result)
129:     MM->>MM: Format state/result into HumanMessage (with text/image)
130:     MM->>MM: Calculate tokens for new message
131:     MM->>MM: Add HumanMessage to internal history list
132:     MM->>MM: Update total token count
133:     MM->>MM: Check token limit, potentially call cut_messages()
134:     Note over Agent: Ready to ask LLM
135:     Agent->>MM: get_messages()
136:     MM-->>Agent: Return List[BaseMessage] (System, Task, State1, Plan1, State2...)
137:     Agent->>LLM: Invoke LLM with message list
138:     LLM-->>Agent: LLM Response (AgentOutput containing plan)
139:     Note over Agent: Got LLM's plan
140:     Agent->>MM: _remove_last_state_message() # Optimization
141:     MM->>MM: Remove last (large) HumanMessage from list
142:     Agent->>MM: add_model_output(AgentOutput)
143:     MM->>MM: Format plan into AIMessage (with tool calls)
144:     MM->>MM: Calculate tokens for AIMessage
145:     MM->>MM: Add AIMessage to internal history list
146:     MM->>MM: Update total token count
147:     Note over Agent: Ready to execute plan
148:     Agent->>Controller: multi_act(AgentOutput.action)
149:     Controller-->>Agent: List[ActionResult] (Result of this step's actions)
150:     Agent->>Agent: Store ActionResult in `self.state.last_result` (for next step)
151:     Note over Agent: End of step
152: ```
153: 
154: This shows how `MessageManager` sits between the Agent, the Browser State, and the LLM, managing the history list and token counts.
155: 
156: ## Diving Deeper into the Code (`agent/message_manager/service.py`)
157: 
158: Let's look at simplified versions of key methods in `MessageManager`.
159: 
160: **1. Initialization (`__init__` and `_init_messages`)**
161: 
162: When the `Agent` creates the `MessageManager`, it passes the task and the already-formatted `SystemMessage`.
163: 
164: ```python
165: # --- File: agent/message_manager/service.py (Simplified __init__) ---
166: from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage, ToolMessage
167: # ... other imports ...
168: from browser_use.agent.views import MessageManagerState # Internal state storage
169: from browser_use.agent.message_manager.views import MessageMetadata, ManagedMessage # Message wrapper
170: 
171: class MessageManager:
172:     def __init__(
173:         self,
174:         task: str,
175:         system_message: SystemMessage, # Received from Agent
176:         settings: MessageManagerSettings = MessageManagerSettings(),
177:         state: MessageManagerState = MessageManagerState(), # Stores history
178:     ):
179:         self.task = task
180:         self.settings = settings # Max tokens, image settings, etc.
181:         self.state = state # Holds the 'history' object
182:         self.system_prompt = system_message
183: 
184:         # Only initialize if history is empty (e.g., not resuming from saved state)
185:         if len(self.state.history.messages) == 0:
186:             self._init_messages()
187: 
188:     def _init_messages(self) -> None:
189:         """Add the initial fixed messages to the history."""
190:         # Add the main system prompt (rules)
191:         self._add_message_with_tokens(self.system_prompt)
192: 
193:         # Add the user's task
194:         task_message = HumanMessage(
195:             content=f'Your ultimate task is: """{self.task}"""...'
196:         )
197:         self._add_message_with_tokens(task_message)
198: 
199:         # Add other setup messages (context, sensitive data info, examples)
200:         # ... (simplified - see full code for details) ...
201: 
202:         # Example: Add a placeholder for where the main history begins
203:         placeholder_message = HumanMessage(content='[Your task history memory starts here]')
204:         self._add_message_with_tokens(placeholder_message)
205: ```
206: 
207: This sets up the foundational context for the LLM.
208: 
209: **2. Adding Browser State (`add_state_message`)**
210: 
211: This method takes the current `BrowserState` and the previous `ActionResult`, formats them into a `HumanMessage` (potentially multi-modal with image and text parts), and adds it to the history.
212: 
213: ```python
214: # --- File: agent/message_manager/service.py (Simplified add_state_message) ---
215: # ... imports ...
216: from browser_use.browser.views import BrowserState
217: from browser_use.agent.views import ActionResult, AgentStepInfo
218: from browser_use.agent.prompts import AgentMessagePrompt # Helper to format state
219: 
220: class MessageManager:
221:     # ... (init) ...
222: 
223:     def add_state_message(
224:         self,
225:         state: BrowserState, # The current view of the browser
226:         result: Optional[List[ActionResult]] = None, # Result from *previous* action
227:         step_info: Optional[AgentStepInfo] = None,
228:         use_vision=True, # Flag to include screenshot
229:     ) -> None:
230:         """Add browser state and previous result as a human message."""
231: 
232:         # Add any 'memory' messages from the previous result first (if any)
233:         if result:
234:             for r in result:
235:                 if r.include_in_memory and (r.extracted_content or r.error):
236:                     content = f"Action result: {r.extracted_content}" if r.extracted_content else f"Action error: {r.error}"
237:                     msg = HumanMessage(content=content)
238:                     self._add_message_with_tokens(msg)
239:                     result = None # Don't include again in the main state message
240: 
241:         # Use a helper class to format the BrowserState (+ optional remaining result)
242:         # into the correct message structure (text + optional image)
243:         state_prompt = AgentMessagePrompt(
244:             state,
245:             result, # Pass any remaining result info
246:             include_attributes=self.settings.include_attributes,
247:             step_info=step_info,
248:         )
249:         # Get the formatted message (could be complex list for vision)
250:         state_message = state_prompt.get_user_message(use_vision)
251: 
252:         # Add the formatted message (with token calculation) to history
253:         self._add_message_with_tokens(state_message)
254: 
255: ```
256: 
257: **3. Adding Model Output (`add_model_output`)**
258: 
259: This takes the LLM's plan (`AgentOutput`) and formats it as an `AIMessage` with specific "tool calls" structure that many models expect.
260: 
261: ```python
262: # --- File: agent/message_manager/service.py (Simplified add_model_output) ---
263: # ... imports ...
264: from browser_use.agent.views import AgentOutput
265: 
266: class MessageManager:
267:     # ... (init, add_state_message) ...
268: 
269:     def add_model_output(self, model_output: AgentOutput) -> None:
270:         """Add model output (the plan) as an AI message with tool calls."""
271:         # Format the output according to OpenAI's tool calling standard
272:         tool_calls = [
273:             {
274:                 'name': 'AgentOutput', # The 'tool' name
275:                 'args': model_output.model_dump(mode='json', exclude_unset=True), # The LLM's JSON output
276:                 'id': str(self.state.tool_id), # Unique ID for the call
277:                 'type': 'tool_call',
278:             }
279:         ]
280:

301: **4. Adding Messages and Counting Tokens (`_add_message_with_tokens`, `_count_tokens`)**

376: 
377: ```
378: 
379: This shows the basic mechanics of adding messages, calculating their approximate size, and applying strategies to keep the history within the LLM's context window limit.
380: 
381: ## Conclusion
382: 
383: The `MessageManager` is the Agent's conversation secretary. It meticulously records the dialogue between the Agent (reporting browser state and action results) and the LLM (providing analysis and action plans), starting from the initial `System Prompt` and task definition.
384: 
385: Crucially, it formats these messages correctly, tracks the conversation's size using token counts, and implements strategies to keep the history concise enough for the LLM's limited context window. Without the `MessageManager`, the Agent would quickly lose track of the conversation, and the LLM wouldn't have the necessary context to guide the browser effectively.
386: 
387: Many of the objects managed and passed around by the `MessageManager`, like `BrowserState`, `ActionResult`, and `AgentOutput`, are defined as specific data structures. In the next chapter, we'll take a closer look at these important **Data Structures (Views)**.

  8: # Chapter 7: Data Structures (Views) - The Project's Blueprints
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](06_message_manager.md), we saw how the `MessageManager` acts like a secretary, carefully organizing the conversation between the [Agent](01_agent.md) and the LLM. It manages different pieces of information – the browser's current state, the LLM's plan, the results of actions, and more.
 11: 
 12: But how do all these different components – the Agent, the LLM parser, the [BrowserContext](03_browsercontext.md), the [Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md), and the [Message Manager](06_message_manager.md) – ensure they understand each other perfectly? If the LLM gives a plan in one format, and the Controller expects it in another, things will break!
 13: 
 14: Imagine trying to build furniture using instructions written in a language you don't fully understand, or trying to fill out a form where every section uses a different layout. It would be confusing and error-prone. We need a shared, consistent language and format.
 15: 
 16: This is where **Data Structures (Views)** come in. They act as the official blueprints or standardized forms for all the important information passed around within the `Browser Use` project.
 17: 
 18: ## What Problem Do Data Structures Solve?
 19: 
 20: In a complex system like `Browser Use`, many components need to exchange data:
 21: 
 22: *   The [BrowserContext](03_browsercontext.md) needs to package up the current state of the webpage.
 23: *   The [Agent](01_agent.md) needs to understand the LLM's multi-step plan.
 24: *   The [Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md) needs to know exactly which action to perform and with what specific parameters (like which element index to click).
 25: *   The Controller needs to report back the result of an action in a predictable way.
 26: 
 27: Without a standard format for each piece of data, you might encounter problems like:
 28: 
 29: *   Misinterpreting data (e.g., is `5` an element index or a quantity?).
 30: *   Missing required information.
 31: *   Inconsistent naming (`element_id` vs `index` vs `element_number`).
 32: *   Difficulty debugging when data looks different every time.
 33: 
 34: Data Structures (Views) solve this by defining **strict, consistent blueprints** for the data. Everyone agrees to use these blueprints, ensuring smooth communication and preventing errors.
 35: 
 36: ## Meet Pydantic: The Blueprint Maker and Checker
 37: 
 38: In `Browser Use`, these blueprints are primarily defined using a popular Python library called **Pydantic**.
 39: 
 40: Think of Pydantic like a combination of:
 41: 
 42: 1.  **A Blueprint Designer:** It provides an easy way to define the structure of your data using standard Python type hints (like `str` for text, `int` for whole numbers, `bool` for True/False, `list` for lists).
 43: 2.  **A Quality Inspector:** When data comes in (e.g., from the LLM or from an action's result), Pydantic automatically checks if it matches the blueprint. Does it have all the required fields? Are the data types correct? If not, Pydantic raises an error, stopping bad data before it causes problems later.
 44: 
 45: These Pydantic models (our blueprints) are often stored in files named `views.py` within different component directories (like `agent/views.py`, `browser/views.py`), which is why we sometimes call them "Views".
 46: 
 47: ## Key Blueprints in `Browser Use`
 48: 
 49: Let's look at some of the most important data structures used in the project. Don't worry about memorizing every detail; focus on *what kind* of information each blueprint holds and *who* uses it.
 50: 
 51: *(Note: These are simplified representations. The actual models might have more fields or features.)*
 52: 
 53: ### 1. `BrowserState` (from `browser/views.py`)
 54: 
 55: *   **Purpose:** Represents a complete snapshot of the browser's state at a specific moment.
 56: *   **Blueprint Contents (Simplified):**
 57:     *   `url`: The current web address (string).
 58:     *   `title`: The title of the webpage (string).
 59:     *   `element_tree`: The simplified map of the webpage content (from [DOM Representation](04_dom_representation.md)).
 60:     *   `selector_map`: The lookup map for interactive elements (from [DOM Representation](04_dom_representation.md)).
 61:     *   `screenshot`: An optional image of the page (string, base64 encoded).
 62:     *   `tabs`: Information about other open tabs in this context (list).
 63: *   **Who Uses It:**
 64:     *   Created by: [BrowserContext](03_browsercontext.md) (`get_state()` method).
 65:     *   Used by: [Agent](01_agent.md) (to see the current situation), [Message Manager](06_message_manager.md) (to store in history).
 66: 
 67: ```python
 68: # --- Conceptual Pydantic Model ---
 69: # File: browser/views.py (Simplified Example)
 70: from pydantic import BaseModel
 71: from typing import Optional, List, Dict # For type hints
 72: # Assume DOMElementNode and TabInfo are defined elsewhere
 73: 
 74: class BrowserState(BaseModel):
 75:     url: str
 76:     title: str
 77:     element_tree: Optional[object] # Simplified: Actual type is DOMElementNode
 78:     selector_map: Optional[Dict[int, object]] # Simplified: Actual type is SelectorMap
 79:     screenshot: Optional[str] = None # Optional field
 80:     tabs: List[object] = [] # Simplified: Actual type is TabInfo
 81: 
 82: # Pydantic ensures that when a BrowserState is created,
 83: # 'url' and 'title' MUST be provided as strings.
 84: ```
 85: 
 86: ### 2. `ActionModel` (from `controller/registry/views.py`)
 87: 
 88: *   **Purpose:** Represents a *single* specific action the LLM wants to perform, including its parameters. This model is often created *dynamically* based on the actions available in the [Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md).
 89: *   **Blueprint Contents (Example for `click_element`):**
 90:     *   `index`: The `highlight_index` of the element to click (integer).
 91:     *   `xpath`: An optional hint about the element's location (string).
 92: *   **Blueprint Contents (Example for `input_text`):**
 93:     *   `index`: The `highlight_index` of the input field (integer).
 94:     *   `text`: The text to type (string).
 95: *   **Who Uses It:**
 96:     *   Defined by/Registered in: [Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md).
 97:     *   Created based on: LLM output (often part of `AgentOutput`).
 98:     *   Used by: [Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md) (to validate parameters and know what function to call).
 99: 
100: ```python
101: # --- Conceptual Pydantic Models ---
102: # File: controller/views.py (Simplified Examples)
103: from pydantic import BaseModel
104: from typing import Optional
105: 
106: class ClickElementAction(BaseModel):
107:     index: int
108:     xpath: Optional[str] = None # Optional hint
109: 
110: class InputTextAction(BaseModel):
111:     index: int
112:     text: str
113:     xpath: Optional[str] = None # Optional hint
114: 
115: # Base model that dynamically holds ONE of the above actions
116: class ActionModel(BaseModel):
117:     # Pydantic allows models like this where only one field is expected
118:     # e.g., ActionModel(click_element=ClickElementAction(index=5))
119:     # or    ActionModel(input_text=InputTextAction(index=12, text="hello"))
120:     click_element: Optional[ClickElementAction] = None
121:     input_text: Optional[InputTextAction] = None
122:     # ... fields for other possible actions (scroll, done, etc.) ...
123:     pass # More complex logic handles ensuring only one action is present
124: ```
125: 
126: ### 3. `AgentOutput` (from `agent/views.py`)
127: 
128: *   **Purpose:** Represents the complete plan received from the LLM after it analyzes the current state. This is the structure the [System Prompt](02_system_prompt.md) tells the LLM to follow.
129: *   **Blueprint Contents (Simplified):**
130:     *   `current_state`: The LLM's thoughts/reasoning (a nested structure, often called `AgentBrain`).
131:     *   `action`: A *list* of one or more `ActionModel` objects representing the steps the LLM wants to take.
132: *   **Who Uses It:**
133:     *   Created by: The [Agent](01_agent.md) parses the LLM's raw JSON output into this structure.
134:     *   Used by: [Agent](01_agent.md) (to understand the plan), [Message Manager](06_message_manager.md) (to store the plan in history), [Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md) (reads the `action` list).
135: 
136: ```python
137: # --- Conceptual Pydantic Model ---
138: # File: agent/views.py (Simplified Example)
139: from pydantic import BaseModel
140: from typing import List
141: # Assume ActionModel and AgentBrain are defined elsewhere
142: 
143: class AgentOutput(BaseModel):
144:     current_state: object # Simplified: Actual type is AgentBrain
145:     action: List[ActionModel] # A list of actions to execute
146: 
147: # Pydantic ensures the LLM output MUST have 'current_state' and 'action',
148: # and that 'action' MUST be a list containing valid ActionModel objects.
149: ```
150: 
151: ### 4. `ActionResult` (from `agent/views.py`)
152: 
153: *   **Purpose:** Represents the outcome after the [Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md) attempts to execute a single action.
154: *   **Blueprint Contents (Simplified):**
155:     *   `is_done`: Did this action signal the end of the overall task? (boolean, optional).
156:     *   `success`: If done, was the task successful overall? (boolean, optional).
157:     *   `extracted_content`: Any text result from the action (e.g., "Clicked button X") (string, optional).
158:     *   `error`: Any error message if the action failed (string, optional).
159:     *   `include_in_memory`: Should this result be explicitly shown to the LLM next time? (boolean).
160: *   **Who Uses It:**
161:     *   Created by: Functions within the [Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md) (like `click_element`).
162:     *   Used by: [Agent](01_agent.md) (to check status, record results), [Message Manager](06_message_manager.md) (includes info in the next state message sent to LLM).
163: 
164: ```python
165: # --- Conceptual Pydantic Model ---
166: # File: agent/views.py (Simplified Example)
167: from pydantic import BaseModel
168: from typing import Optional
169: 
170: class ActionResult(BaseModel):
171:     is_done: Optional[bool] = False
172:     success: Optional[bool] = None
173:     extracted_content: Optional[str] = None
174:     error: Optional[str] = None
175:     include_in_memory: bool = False # Default to False
176: 
177: # Pydantic helps ensure results are consistently structured.
178: # For example, 'is_done' must be True or False if provided.
179: ```
180: 
181: ## The Power of Blueprints: Ensuring Consistency
182: 
183: Using Pydantic models for these data structures provides a huge benefit: **automatic validation**.
184: 
185: Imagine the LLM sends back a plan, but it forgets to include the `index` for a `click_element` action.
186: 
187: ```json
188: // Bad LLM Response (Missing 'index')
189: {
190:   "current_state": { ... },
191:   "action": [
192:     {
193:       "click_element": {
194:          "xpath": "//button[@id='submit']" // 'index' is missing!
195:       }
196:     }
197:   ]
198: }
199: ```
200: 
201: When the [Agent](01_agent.md) tries to parse this JSON into the `AgentOutput` Pydantic model, Pydantic will immediately notice that the `index` field (which is required by the `ClickElementAction` blueprint) is missing. It will raise a `ValidationError`.
202: 
203: ```python
204: # --- Conceptual Agent Code ---
205: import pydantic
206: # Assume AgentOutput is the Pydantic model defined earlier
207: # Assume 'llm_json_response' contains the bad JSON from above
208: 
209: try:
210:     # Try to create the AgentOutput object from the LLM's response
211:     llm_plan = AgentOutput.model_validate_json(llm_json_response)
212:     # If validation succeeds, proceed...
213:     print("LLM Plan Validated:", llm_plan)
214: except pydantic.ValidationError as e:
215:     # Pydantic catches the error!
216:     print(f"Validation Error: The LLM response didn't match the blueprint!")
217:     print(e)
218:     # The Agent can now handle this error gracefully,
219:     # maybe asking the LLM to try again, instead of crashing later.
220: ```
221: 
222: This automatic checking catches errors early, preventing the [Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md) from receiving incomplete instructions and making the whole system much more robust and easier to debug. It enforces the "contract" between different components.
223: 
224: ## Under the Hood: Simple Classes
225: 
226: These data structures are simply Python classes, mostly inheriting from `pydantic.BaseModel` or defined using Python's built-in `dataclass`. They don't contain complex logic themselves; their main job is to define the *shape* and *type* of the data. You'll find their definitions scattered across the various `views.py` files within the project's component directories (like `agent/`, `browser/`, `controller/`, `dom/`).
227: 
228: Think of them as the official vocabulary and grammar rules that all the components agree to use when communicating.
229: 
230: ## Conclusion
231: 
232: Data Structures (Views), primarily defined using Pydantic models, are the essential blueprints that ensure consistent and reliable communication within the `Browser Use` project. They act like standardized forms for `BrowserState`, `AgentOutput`, `ActionModel`, and `ActionResult`, making sure every component knows exactly what kind of data to expect and how to interpret it.
233: 
234: By defining these clear structures and leveraging Pydantic's automatic validation, `Browser Use` prevents misunderstandings between components, catches errors early, and makes the overall system more robust and maintainable. These standardized structures also make it easier to log and understand what's happening in the system.
235: 
236: Speaking of logging and understanding the system's behavior, how can we monitor the Agent's performance and gather data for improvement? In the next and final chapter, we'll explore the [Telemetry Service](08_telemetry_service.md).

  8: # Chapter 8: Telemetry Service - Helping Improve the Project (Optional)
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](07_data_structures__views_.md), we explored the essential blueprints (`Data Structures (Views)`) that keep communication clear and consistent between all the parts of `Browser Use`. We saw how components like the [Agent](01_agent.md) and the [Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md) use these blueprints to exchange information reliably.
 11: 
 12: Now, let's think about the project itself. How do the developers who build `Browser Use` know if it's working well for users? How do they find out about common errors or which features are most popular, so they can make the tool better?
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does the Telemetry Service Solve?
 15: 
 16: Imagine you released a new tool, like `Browser Use`. You want it to be helpful, but you don't know how people are actually using it. Are they running into unexpected errors? Are certain actions (like clicking vs. scrolling) causing problems? Is the performance okay? Without some feedback, it's hard to know where to focus improvements.
 17: 
 18: One way to get feedback is through bug reports or feature requests, but that only captures a small fraction of user experiences. We need a way to get a broader, anonymous picture of how the tool is performing "in the wild."
 19: 
 20: The **Telemetry Service** solves this by providing an *optional* and *anonymous* way to send basic usage statistics back to the project developers. Think of it like an anonymous suggestion box or an automatic crash report that doesn't include any personal information.
 21: 
 22: **Crucially:** This service is designed to protect user privacy. It doesn't collect website content, personal data, or anything sensitive. It only sends anonymous statistics about the tool's operation, and **it can be completely disabled**.
 23: 
 24: ## Meet `ProductTelemetry`: The Anonymous Reporter
 25: 
 26: The component responsible for this is the `ProductTelemetry` service, found in `telemetry/service.py`.
 27: 
 28: *   **Collects Usage Data:** It gathers anonymized information about events like:
 29:     *   When an [Agent](01_agent.md) starts or finishes a run.
 30:     *   Details about each step the Agent takes (like which actions were used).
 31:     *   Errors encountered during agent runs.
 32:     *   Which actions are defined in the [Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md).
 33: *   **Anonymizes Data:** It uses a randomly generated user ID (stored locally, not linked to you) to group events from the same installation without knowing *who* the user is.
 34: *   **Sends Data:** It sends this anonymous data to a secure third-party service (PostHog) used by the developers to analyze trends and identify potential issues.
 35: *   **Optional:** You can easily turn it off.
 36: 
 37: ## How is Telemetry Used? (Mostly Automatic)
 38: 
 39: You usually don't interact with the `ProductTelemetry` service directly. Instead, other components like the `Agent` and `Controller` automatically call it at key moments.
 40: 
 41: **Example: Agent Run Start/End**
 42: 
 43: When you create an `Agent` and call `agent.run()`, the Agent automatically notifies the Telemetry Service.
 44: 
 45: ```python
 46: # --- File: agent/service.py (Simplified Agent run method) ---
 47: class Agent:
 48:     # ... (other methods) ...
 49: 
 50:     # Agent has a telemetry object initialized in __init__
 51:     # self.telemetry = ProductTelemetry()
 52: 
 53:     async def run(self, max_steps: int = 100) -> AgentHistoryList:
 54:         # ---> Tell Telemetry: Agent run is starting <---
 55:         self._log_agent_run() # This includes a telemetry.capture() call
 56: 
 57:         try:
 58:             # ... (main agent loop runs here) ...
 59:             for step_num in range(max_steps):
 60:                 # ... (agent takes steps) ...
 61:                 if self.state.history.is_done():
 62:                     break
 63:             # ...
 64:         finally:
 65:             # ---> Tell Telemetry: Agent run is ending <---
 66:             self.telemetry.capture(
 67:                 AgentEndTelemetryEvent( # Uses a specific data structure
 68:                     agent_id=self.state.agent_id,
 69:                     is_done=self.state.history.is_done(),
 70:                     success=self.state.history.is_successful(),
 71:                     # ... other anonymous stats ...
 72:                 )
 73:             )
 74:             # ... (cleanup browser etc.) ...
 75: 
 76:         return self.state.history
 77: ```
 78: 
 79: **Explanation:**
 80: 
 81: 1.  When the `Agent` is created, it gets an instance of `ProductTelemetry`.
 82: 2.  Inside the `run` method, before the main loop starts, `_log_agent_run()` is called, which internally uses `self.telemetry.capture()` to send an `AgentRunTelemetryEvent`.
 83: 3.  After the loop finishes (or an error occurs), the `finally` block ensures that another `self.telemetry.capture()` call is made, this time sending an `AgentEndTelemetryEvent` with summary statistics about the run.
 84: 
 85: Similarly, the `Agent.step` method captures an `AgentStepTelemetryEvent`, and the `Controller`'s `Registry` captures a `ControllerRegisteredFunctionsTelemetryEvent` when it's initialized. This happens automatically in the background if telemetry is enabled.
 86: 
 87: ## How to Disable Telemetry
 88: 
 89: If you prefer not to send any anonymous usage data, you can easily disable the Telemetry Service.
 90: 
 91: Set the environment variable `ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY` to `False`.
 92: 
 93: How you set environment variables depends on your operating system:
 94: 
 95: *   **Linux/macOS (in terminal):**
 96:     ```bash
 97:     export ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False
 98:     # Now run your Python script in the same terminal
 99:     python your_agent_script.py
100:     ```
101: *   **Windows (Command Prompt):**
102:     ```cmd
103:     set ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False
104:     python your_agent_script.py
105:     ```
106: *   **Windows (PowerShell):**
107:     ```powershell
108:     $env:ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY="False"
109:     python your_agent_script.py
110:     ```
111: *   **In Python Code (using `os` module, *before* importing `browser_use`):**
112:     ```python
113:     import os
114:     os.environ['ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY'] = 'False'
115: 
116:     # Now import and use browser_use
117:     from browser_use import Agent # ... other imports
118:     # ... rest of your script ...
119:     ```
120: 
121: If this environment variable is set to `False`, the `ProductTelemetry` service will be initialized in a disabled state, and no data will be collected or sent.
122: 
123: ## How It Works Under the Hood: Sending Anonymous Data
124: 
125: When telemetry is enabled and an event occurs (like `agent.run()` starting):
126: 
127: 1.  **Component Calls Capture:** The `Agent` (or `Controller`) calls `telemetry.capture(event_data)`.
128: 2.  **Telemetry Service Checks:** The `ProductTelemetry` service checks if it's enabled. If not, it does nothing.
129: 3.  **Get User ID:** It retrieves or generates a unique, anonymous user ID. This is typically a random UUID (like `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`) stored in a hidden file on your computer (`~/.cache/browser_use/telemetry_user_id`). This ID helps group events from the same installation without identifying the actual user.
130: 4.  **Send to PostHog:** It sends the event data (structured using Pydantic models like `AgentRunTelemetryEvent`) along with the anonymous user ID to PostHog, a third-party service specialized in product analytics.
131: 5.  **Analysis:** Developers can then look at aggregated, anonymous trends in PostHog (e.g., "What percentage of agent runs finish successfully?", "What are the most common errors?") to understand usage patterns and prioritize improvements.
132: 
133: Here's a simplified diagram:
134: 
135: ```mermaid
136: sequenceDiagram
137:     participant Agent
138:     participant TelemetrySvc as ProductTelemetry
139:     participant LocalFile as ~/.cache/.../user_id
140:     participant PostHog
141: 
142:     Agent->>TelemetrySvc: capture(AgentRunEvent)
143:     Note over TelemetrySvc: Telemetry Enabled? Yes.
144:     TelemetrySvc->>LocalFile: Read existing User ID (or create new)
145:     LocalFile-->>TelemetrySvc: Anonymous User ID (UUID)
146:     Note over TelemetrySvc: Package Event + User ID
147:     TelemetrySvc->>PostHog: Send(EventData, UserID)
148:     PostHog-->>TelemetrySvc: Acknowledgment (Optional)
149: ```
150: 
151: Let's look at the simplified code involved.
152: 
153: **1. Initializing Telemetry (`telemetry/service.py`)**
154: 
155: The service checks the environment variable during initialization.
156: 
157: ```python
158: # --- File: telemetry/service.py (Simplified __init__) ---
159: import os
160: import uuid
161: import logging
162: from pathlib import Path
163: from posthog import Posthog # The library for the external service
164: from browser_use.utils import singleton
165: 
166: logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
167: 
168: @singleton # Ensures only one instance exists
169: class ProductTelemetry:
170:     USER_ID_PATH = str(Path.home() / '.cache' / 'browser_use' / 'telemetry_user_id')
171:     # ... (API key constants) ...
172:     _curr_user_id = None
173: 
174:     def __init__(self) -> None:
175:         # Check the environment variable
176:         telemetry_disabled = os.getenv('ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY', 'true').lower() == 'false'
177: 
178:         if telemetry_disabled:
179:             self._posthog_client = None # Telemetry is off
180:             logger.debug('Telemetry disabled by environment variable.')
181:         else:
182:             # Initialize the PostHog client if enabled
183:             self._posthog_client = Posthog(...)
184:             logger.info(
185:                 'Anonymized telemetry enabled.' # Inform the user
186:             )
187:             # Optionally silence PostHog's own logs
188:             # ...
189: 
190:     # ... (other methods) ...
191: ```
192: 
193: **2. Capturing an Event (`telemetry/service.py`)**
194: 
195: The `capture` method sends the data if the client is active.
196: 
197: ```python
198: # --- File: telemetry/service.py (Simplified capture) ---
199: # Assume BaseTelemetryEvent is the base Pydantic model for events
200: from browser_use.telemetry.views import BaseTelemetryEvent
201: 
202: class ProductTelemetry:
203:     # ... (init) ...
204: 
205:     def capture(self, event: BaseTelemetryEvent) -> None:
206:         # Do nothing if telemetry is disabled
207:         if self._posthog_client is None:
208:             return
209: 
210:         try:
211:             # Get the anonymous user ID (lazy loaded)
212:             anon_user_id = self.user_id
213: 
214:             # Send the event name and its properties (as a dictionary)
215:             self._posthog_client.capture(
216:                 distinct_id=anon_user_id,
217:                 event=event.name, # e.g., "agent_run"
218:                 properties=event.properties # Data from the event model
219:             )
220:             logger.debug(f'Telemetry event captured: {event.name}')
221:         except Exception as e:
222:             # Don't crash the main application if telemetry fails
223:             logger.error(f'Failed to send telemetry event {event.name}: {e}')
224: 
225:     @property
226:     def user_id(self) -> str:
227:         """Gets or creates the anonymous user ID."""
228:         if self._curr_user_id:
229:             return self._curr_user_id
230: 
231:         try:
232:             # Check if the ID file exists
233:             id_file = Path(self.USER_ID_PATH)
234:             if not id_file.exists():
235:                 # Create directory and generate a new UUID if it doesn't exist
236:                 id_file.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
237:                 new_user_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
238:                 id_file.write_text(new_user_id)
239:                 self._curr_user_id = new_user_id
240:             else:
241:                 # Read the existing UUID from the file
242:                 self._curr_user_id = id_file.read_text().strip()
243:         except Exception:
244:             # Fallback if file access fails
245:             self._curr_user_id = 'UNKNOWN_USER_ID'
246:         return self._curr_user_id
247: 
248: ```
249: 
250: **3. Event Data Structures (`telemetry/views.py`)**
251: 
252: Like other components, Telemetry uses Pydantic models to define the structure of the data being sent.
253: 
254: ```python
255: # --- File: telemetry/views.py (Simplified Event Example) ---
256: from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict
257: from typing import Any, Dict, Sequence
258: 
259: # Base class for all telemetry events (conceptual)
260: @dataclass
261: class BaseTelemetryEvent:
262:     @property
263:     def name(self) -> str:
264:         raise NotImplementedError
265:     @property
266:     def properties(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
267:         # Helper to convert the dataclass fields to a dictionary
268:         return {k: v for k, v in asdict(self).items() if k != 'name'}
269: 
270: # Specific event for when an agent run starts
271: @dataclass
272: class AgentRunTelemetryEvent(BaseTelemetryEvent):
273:     agent_id: str        # Anonymous ID for the specific agent instance
274:     use_vision: bool     # Was vision enabled?
275:     task: str            # The task description (anonymized/hashed in practice)
276:     model_name: str      # Name of the LLM used
277:     chat_model_library: str # Library used for the LLM (e.g., ChatOpenAI)
278:     version: str         # browser-use version
279:     source: str          # How browser-use was installed (e.g., pip, git)
280:     name: str = 'agent_run' # The event name sent to PostHog
281: 
282: # ... other event models like AgentEndTelemetryEvent, AgentStepTelemetryEvent ...
283: ```
284: 
285: These structures ensure the data sent to PostHog is consistent and well-defined.
286: 
287: ## Conclusion
288: 
289: The **Telemetry Service** (`ProductTelemetry`) provides an optional and privacy-conscious way for the `Browser Use` project to gather anonymous feedback about how the tool is being used. It automatically captures events like agent runs, steps, and errors, sending anonymized statistics to developers via PostHog.
290: 
291: This feedback loop is vital for identifying common issues, understanding feature usage, and ultimately improving the `Browser Use` library for everyone. Remember, you have full control and can easily disable this service by setting the `ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False` environment variable.
292: 
293: This chapter concludes our tour of the core components within the `Browser Use` project. You've learned about the [Agent](01_agent.md), the guiding [System Prompt](02_system_prompt.md), the isolated [BrowserContext](03_browsercontext.md), the webpage map ([DOM Representation](04_dom_representation.md)), the action execution engine ([Action Controller & Registry](05_action_controller___registry.md)), the conversation tracker ([Message Manager](06_message_manager.md)), the data blueprints ([Data Structures (Views)](07_data_structures__views_.md)), and now the optional feedback mechanism ([Telemetry Service](08_telemetry_service.md)). We hope this gives you a solid foundation for understanding and using `Browser Use`!

  8: # Chapter 1: The Celery App - Your Task Headquarters
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the world of Celery! If you've ever thought, "I wish this slow part of my web request could run somewhere else later," or "How can I process this huge amount of data without freezing my main application?", then Celery is here to help.
 11: 
 12: Celery allows you to run code (we call these "tasks") separately from your main application, either in the background on the same machine or distributed across many different machines.
 13: 
 14: But how do you tell Celery *what* tasks to run and *how* to run them? That's where the **Celery App** comes in.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Does the Celery App Solve?
 17: 
 18: Imagine you're building a website. When a user uploads a profile picture, you need to resize it into different formats (thumbnail, medium, large). Doing this immediately when the user clicks "upload" can make the request slow and keep the user waiting.
 19: 
 20: Ideally, you want to:
 21: 1.  Quickly save the original image.
 22: 2.  Tell the user "Okay, got it!"
 23: 3.  *Later*, in the background, resize the image.
 24: 
 25: Celery helps with step 3. But you need a central place to define the "resize image" task and configure *how* it should be run (e.g., where to send the request to resize, where to store the result). The **Celery App** is that central place.
 26: 
 27: Think of it like the main application object in web frameworks like Flask or Django. It's the starting point, the brain, the headquarters for everything Celery-related in your project.
 28: 
 29: ## Creating Your First Celery App
 30: 
 31: Getting started is simple. You just need to create an instance of the `Celery` class.
 32: 
 33: Let's create a file named `celery_app.py`:
 34: 
 35: ```python
 36: # celery_app.py
 37: from celery import Celery
 38: 
 39: # Create a Celery app instance
 40: # 'tasks' is just a name for this app instance, often the module name.
 41: # 'broker' tells Celery where to send task messages.
 42: # We'll use Redis here for simplicity (you need Redis running).
 43: app = Celery('tasks',
 44:              broker='redis://localhost:6379/0',
 45:              backend='redis://localhost:6379/0') # Added backend for results
 46: 
 47: print(f"Celery app created: {app}")
 48: ```
 49: 
 50: **Explanation:**
 51: 
 52: *   `from celery import Celery`: We import the main `Celery` class.
 53: *   `app = Celery(...)`: We create an instance.
 54:     *   `'tasks'`: This is the *name* of our Celery application. It's often good practice to use the name of the module where your app is defined. Celery uses this name to automatically name tasks if you don't provide one explicitly.
 55:     *   `broker='redis://localhost:6379/0'`: This is crucial! It tells Celery where to send the task messages. A "broker" is like a post office for tasks. We're using Redis here, but Celery supports others like RabbitMQ. We'll learn more about the [Broker Connection (AMQP)](04_broker_connection__amqp_.md) in Chapter 4. (Note: AMQP is the protocol often used with brokers like RabbitMQ, but the concept applies even when using Redis).
 56:     *   `backend='redis://localhost:6379/0'`: This tells Celery where to store the results of your tasks. If your task returns a value (like `2+2` returns `4`), Celery can store this `4` in the backend. We'll cover the [Result Backend](06_result_backend.md) in Chapter 6.
 57: 
 58: That's it! You now have a `Celery` application instance named `app`. This `app` object is your main tool for working with Celery.
 59: 
 60: ## Defining a Task with the App
 61: 
 62: Now that we have our `app`, how do we define a task? We use the `@app.task` decorator.
 63: 
 64: Let's modify `celery_app.py`:
 65: 
 66: ```python
 67: # celery_app.py
 68: from celery import Celery
 69: import time
 70: 
 71: # Create a Celery app instance
 72: app = Celery('tasks',
 73:              broker='redis://localhost:6379/0',
 74:              backend='redis://localhost:6379/0')
 75: 
 76: # Define a simple task using the app's decorator
 77: @app.task
 78: def add(x, y):
 79:     print(f"Task 'add' started with args: ({x}, {y})")
 80:     time.sleep(2) # Simulate some work
 81:     result = x + y
 82:     print(f"Task 'add' finished with result: {result}")
 83:     return result
 84: 
 85: print(f"Task 'add' is registered: {app.tasks.get('celery_app.add')}")
 86: ```
 87: 
 88: **Explanation:**
 89: 
 90: *   `@app.task`: This is the magic decorator. It takes our regular Python function `add(x, y)` and registers it as a Celery task within our `app`.
 91: *   Now, `app` knows about a task called `celery_app.add` (Celery automatically generates the name based on the module `celery_app` and function `add`).
 92: *   We'll learn all about [Task](03_task.md)s in Chapter 3.
 93: 
 94: ## Sending a Task (Conceptual)
 95: 
 96: How do we actually *run* this `add` task in the background? We use methods like `.delay()` or `.apply_async()` on the task object itself.
 97: 
 98: ```python
 99: # In a separate Python script or interpreter, after importing 'add' from celery_app.py
100: from celery_app import add
101: 
102: # Send the task to the broker configured in our 'app'
103: result_promise = add.delay(4, 5)
104: 
105: print(f"Task sent! It will run in the background.")
106: print(f"We got back a promise object: {result_promise}")
107: # We can later check the result using result_promise.get()
108: # (Requires a result backend and a worker running the task)
109: ```
110: 
111: **Explanation:**
112: 
113: *   `add.delay(4, 5)`: This doesn't run the `add` function *right now*. Instead, it:
114:     1.  Packages the task name (`celery_app.add`) and its arguments (`4`, `5`) into a message.
115:     2.  Sends this message to the **broker** (Redis, in our case) that was configured in our `Celery` app instance (`app`).
116: *   It returns an `AsyncResult` object (our `result_promise`), which is like an IOU or a placeholder for the actual result. We can use this later to check if the task finished and what its result was (if we configured a [Result Backend](06_result_backend.md)).
117: 
118: A separate program, called a Celery [Worker](05_worker.md), needs to be running. This worker watches the broker for new task messages, executes the corresponding task function, and (optionally) stores the result in the backend. We'll learn how to run a worker in Chapter 5.
119: 
120: The key takeaway here is that the **Celery App** holds the configuration needed (`broker` and `backend` URLs) for `add.delay()` to know *where* to send the task message and potentially where the result will be stored.
121: 
122: ## How It Works Internally (High-Level)
123: 
124: Let's visualize the process of creating the app and sending a task:
125: 
126: 1.  **Initialization (`Celery(...)`)**: When you create `app = Celery(...)`, the app instance stores the `broker` and `backend` URLs and sets up internal components like the task registry.
127: 2.  **Task Definition (`@app.task`)**: The decorator tells the `app` instance: "Hey, remember this function `add`? It's a task." The app stores this information in its internal task registry (`app.tasks`).
128: 3.  **Sending a Task (`add.delay(4, 5)`)**:
129:     *   `add.delay()` looks up the `app` it belongs to.
130:     *   It asks the `app` for the `broker` URL.
131:     *   It creates a message containing the task name (`celery_app.add`), arguments (`4, 5`), and other details.
132:     *   It uses the `broker` URL to connect to the broker (Redis) and sends the message.
133:

149:     Broker-->>AddTask: Acknowledgment (message sent)
150:     AddTask-->>Client: Return AsyncResult (promise)
151: ```
152: 
153: This diagram shows how the `Celery App` acts as the central coordinator, holding configuration and enabling the task (`add`) to send its execution request to the Broker.
154: 
155: ## Code Dive: Inside the `Celery` Class
156: 
157: Let's peek at some relevant code snippets (simplified for clarity).
158: 
159: **Initialization (`app/base.py`)**
160: 
161: When you call `Celery(...)`, the `__init__` method runs:
162: 
163: ```python
164: # Simplified from celery/app/base.py
165: from .registry import TaskRegistry
166: from .utils import Settings
167: 
168: class Celery:
169:     def __init__(self, main=None, broker=None, backend=None,
170:                  include=None, config_source=None, task_cls=None,
171:                  autofinalize=True, **kwargs):
172: 
173:         self.main = main # Store the app name ('tasks' in our example)
174:         self._tasks = TaskRegistry({}) # Create an empty dictionary for tasks
175: 
176:         # Store broker/backend/include settings temporarily
177:         self._preconf = {}
178:         self.__autoset('broker_url', broker)
179:         self.__autoset('result_backend', backend)
180:         self.__autoset('include', include)
181:         # ... other kwargs ...
182: 
183:         # Configuration object - initially pending, loaded later
184:         self._conf = Settings(...)
185: 
186:         # ... other setup ...
187: 
188:         _register_app(self) # Register this app instance globally (sometimes useful)
189: 
190:     # Helper to store initial settings before full configuration load
191:     def __autoset(self, key, value):
192:         if value is not None:
193:             self._preconf[key] = value
194: ```
195: 
196: This shows how the `Celery` object is initialized, storing the name, setting up a task registry, and holding onto initial configuration like the `broker` URL. The full configuration is often loaded later (see [Configuration](02_configuration.md)).
197: 
198: **Task Decorator (`app/base.py`)**
199: 
200: The `@app.task` decorator ultimately calls `_task_from_fun`:
201: 
202: ```python
203: # Simplified from celery/app/base.py
204: 
205:     def task(self, *args, **opts):
206:         # ... logic to handle decorator arguments ...
207:         def _create_task_cls(fun):
208:             # If app isn't finalized, might return a proxy object first
209:             # Eventually calls _task_from_fun to create/register the task
210:             ret = self._task_from_fun(fun, **opts)
211:             return ret
212:         return _create_task_cls
213: 
214:     def _task_from_fun(self, fun, name=None, base=None, bind=False, **options):
215:         # Generate task name if not provided (e.g., 'celery_app.add')
216:         name = name or self.gen_task_name(fun.__name__, fun.__module__)
217:         base = base or self.Task # Default base Task class
218: 
219:         # Check if task already registered
220:         if name not in self._tasks:
221:             # Create a Task class dynamically based on the function
222:             task = type(fun.__name__, (base,), {
223:                 'app': self, # Link task back to this app instance!
224:                 'name': name,
225:                 'run': staticmethod(fun), # The actual function to run
226:                 # ... other attributes and options ...
227:             })() # Instantiate the new task class
228:             self._tasks[task.name] = task # Add to app's task registry
229:             task.bind(self) # Perform any binding steps
230:         else:
231:             task = self._tasks[name] # Task already exists
232:         return task
233: ```
234: 
235: This shows how the decorator uses the `app` instance (`self`) to generate a name, create a `Task` object wrapping your function, associate the task with the app (`'app': self`), and store it in the `app._tasks` registry.
236: 
237: **Sending Tasks (`app/base.py`)**
238: 
239: Calling `.delay()` or `.apply_async()` eventually uses `app.send_task`:
240: 
241: ```python
242: # Simplified from celery/app/base.py
243: 
244:     def send_task(self, name, args=None, kwargs=None, task_id=None,
245:                   producer=None, connection=None, router=None, **options):
246:         # ... lots of logic to prepare options, task_id, routing ...
247: 
248:         # Get the routing info (exchange, routing_key, queue)
249:         # Uses app.conf for defaults if not specified
250:         options = self.amqp.router.route(options, name, args, kwargs)
251: 
252:         # Create the message body
253:         message = self.amqp.create_task_message(
254:             task_id or uuid(), # Generate task ID if needed
255:             name, args, kwargs, # Task details
256:             # ... other arguments like countdown, eta, expires ...
257:         )
258: 
259:         # Get a producer (handles connection/channel to broker)
260:         # Uses the app's producer pool (app.producer_pool)
261:         with self.producer_or_acquire(producer) as P:
262:             # Tell the backend we're about to send (if tracking results)
263:             if not options.get('ignore_result', False):
264:                  self.backend.on_task_call(P, task_id)
265: 
266:             # Actually send the message via the producer
267:             self.amqp.send_task_message(P, name, message, **options)
268: 
269:         # Create the AsyncResult object to return to the caller
270:         result = self.AsyncResult(task_id)
271:         # ... set result properties ...
272:         return result
273: ```
274: 
275: This highlights how `send_task` relies on the `app` (via `self`) to:
276: *   Access configuration (`self.conf`).
277: *   Use the AMQP utilities (`self.amqp`) for routing and message creation.
278: *   Access the result backend (`self.backend`).
279: *   Get a connection/producer from the pool (`self.producer_or_acquire`).
280: *   Create the `AsyncResult` using the app's result class (`self.AsyncResult`).
281: 
282: ## Conclusion
283: 
284: You've learned that the `Celery App` is the essential starting point for any Celery project.
285: 
286: *   It acts as the central **headquarters** or **brain**.
287: *   You create it using `app = Celery(...)`, providing at least a name and a `broker` URL.
288: *   It holds **configuration** (like broker/backend URLs).
289: *   It **registers tasks** defined using the `@app.task` decorator.
290: *   It enables tasks to be **sent** to the broker using methods like `.delay()`.
291: 
292: The app ties everything together. But how do you manage all the different settings Celery offers, beyond just the `broker` and `backend`?
293: 
294: In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into how to configure your Celery app effectively.

  8: # Chapter 2: Configuration - Telling Celery How to Work
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: The Celery App](01_celery_app.md), we created our first `Celery` app instance. We gave it a name and told it where our message broker and result backend were located using the `broker` and `backend` arguments:
 11: 
 12: ```python
 13: # From Chapter 1
 14: from celery import Celery
 15: 
 16: app = Celery('tasks',
 17:              broker='redis://localhost:6379/0',
 18:              backend='redis://localhost:6379/0')
 19: ```
 20: 
 21: This worked, but what if we want to change settings later, or manage many different settings? Passing everything directly when creating the `app` can become messy.
 22: 
 23: ## What Problem Does Configuration Solve?
 24: 
 25: Think of Celery as a busy workshop with different stations (workers, schedulers) and tools (message brokers, result storage). **Configuration** is the central instruction manual or settings panel for this entire workshop.
 26: 
 27: It tells Celery things like:
 28: 
 29: *   **Where is the message broker?** (The post office for tasks)
 30: *   **Where should results be stored?** (The filing cabinet for completed work)
 31: *   **How should tasks be handled?** (e.g., What format should the messages use? Are there any speed limits for certain tasks?)
 32: *   **How should the workers behave?** (e.g., How many tasks can they work on at once?)
 33: *   **How should scheduled tasks run?** (e.g., What timezone should be used?)
 34: 
 35: Without configuration, Celery wouldn't know how to connect to your broker, where to put results, or how to manage the workflow. Configuration allows you to customize Celery to fit your specific needs.
 36: 
 37: ## Key Configuration Concepts
 38: 
 39: While Celery has many settings, here are some fundamental ones you'll encounter often:
 40: 
 41: 1.  **`broker_url`**: The address of your message broker (like Redis or RabbitMQ). This is essential for sending and receiving task messages. We'll learn more about brokers in [Chapter 4: Broker Connection (AMQP)](04_broker_connection__amqp_.md).
 42: 2.  **`result_backend`**: The address of your result store. This is needed if you want to keep track of task status or retrieve return values. We cover this in [Chapter 6: Result Backend](06_result_backend.md).
 43: 3.  **`include`**: A list of module names that the Celery worker should import when it starts. This is often where your task definitions live (like the `add` task from Chapter 1).
 44: 4.  **`task_serializer`**: Defines the format used to package task messages before sending them to the broker (e.g., 'json', 'pickle'). 'json' is a safe and common default.
 45: 5.  **`timezone`**: Sets the timezone Celery uses, which is important for scheduled tasks managed by [Chapter 7: Beat (Scheduler)](07_beat__scheduler_.md).
 46: 
 47: ## How to Configure Your Celery App
 48: 
 49: Celery is flexible and offers several ways to set its configuration.
 50: 
 51: **Method 1: Directly on the App Object (After Creation)**
 52: 
 53: You can update the configuration *after* creating the `Celery` app instance using the `app.conf.update()` method. This is handy for simple adjustments or quick tests.
 54: 
 55: ```python
 56: # celery_app.py
 57: from celery import Celery
 58: 
 59: # Create the app (maybe with initial settings)
 60: app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')
 61: 
 62: # Update configuration afterwards
 63: app.conf.update(
 64:     result_backend='redis://localhost:6379/1', # Use database 1 for results
 65:     task_serializer='json',
 66:     result_serializer='json',
 67:     accept_content=['json'], # Only accept json formatted tasks
 68:     timezone='Europe/Oslo',
 69:     enable_utc=True, # Use UTC timezone internally
 70:     # Add task modules to import when worker starts
 71:     include=['my_tasks'] # Assumes you have a file my_tasks.py with tasks
 72: )
 73: 
 74: print(f"Broker URL set to: {app.conf.broker_url}")
 75: print(f"Result backend set to: {app.conf.result_backend}")
 76: print(f"Timezone set to: {app.conf.timezone}")
 77: ```
 78: 
 79: **Explanation:**
 80: 
 81: *   We create the `app` like before, potentially setting some initial config like the `broker`.
 82: *   `app.conf.update(...)`: We pass a Python dictionary to this method. The keys are Celery setting names (like `result_backend`, `timezone`), and the values are what we want to set them to.
 83: *   `app.conf` is the central configuration object attached to your `app` instance.
 84: 
 85: **Method 2: Dedicated Configuration Module (Recommended)**
 86: 
 87: For most projects, especially larger ones, it's cleaner to keep your Celery settings in a separate Python file (e.g., `celeryconfig.py`).
 88: 
 89: 1.  **Create `celeryconfig.py`:**
 90: 
 91:     ```python
 92:     # celeryconfig.py
 93: 
 94:     # Broker settings
 95:     broker_url = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
 96: 
 97:     # Result backend settings
 98:     result_backend = 'redis://localhost:6379/1'
 99: 
100:     # Task settings
101:     task_serializer = 'json'
102:     result_serializer = 'json'
103:     accept_content = ['json']
104: 
105:     # Timezone settings
106:     timezone = 'America/New_York'
107:     enable_utc = True # Recommended
108: 
109:     # List of modules to import when the Celery worker starts.
110:     imports = ('proj.tasks',) # Example: Assuming tasks are in proj/tasks.py
111:     ```
112: 
113:     **Explanation:**
114:     *   This is just a standard Python file.
115:     *   We define variables whose names match the Celery configuration settings (e.g., `broker_url`, `timezone`). Celery expects these specific names.
116: 
117: 2.  **Load the configuration in your app file (`celery_app.py`):**
118: 
119:     ```python
120:     # celery_app.py
121:     from celery import Celery
122: 
123:     # Create the app instance (no need to pass broker/backend here now)
124:     app = Celery('tasks')
125: 
126:     # Load configuration from the 'celeryconfig' module
127:     # Assumes celeryconfig.py is in the same directory or Python path
128:     app.config_from_object('celeryconfig')
129: 
130:     print(f"Loaded Broker URL from config file: {app.conf.broker_url}")
131:     print(f"Loaded Timezone from config file: {app.conf.timezone}")
132: 
133:     # You might still define tasks in this file or in the modules listed
134:     # in celeryconfig.imports
135:     @app.task
136:     def multiply(x, y):
137:         return x * y
138:     ```
139: 
140:     **Explanation:**
141:     *   `app = Celery('tasks')`: We create the app instance, but we don't need to specify the broker or backend here because they will be loaded from the file.
142:     *   `app.config_from_object('celeryconfig')`: This is the key line. It tells Celery to:
143:         *   Find a module named `celeryconfig`.
144:         *   Look at all the uppercase variables defined in that module.
145:         *   Use those variables to configure the `app`.
146: 
147: This approach keeps your settings organized and separate from your application logic.
148: 
149: **Method 3: Environment Variables**
150: 
151: Celery settings can also be controlled via environment variables. This is very useful for deployments (e.g., using Docker) where you might want to change the broker address without changing code.
152: 
153: Environment variable names typically follow the pattern `CELERY_<SETTING_NAME_IN_UPPERCASE>`.
154: 
155: For example, you could set the broker URL in your terminal before running your app or worker:
156: 
157: ```bash
158: # In your terminal (Linux/macOS)
159: export CELERY_BROKER_URL='amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//'
160: export CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND='redis://localhost:6379/2'
161: 
162: # Now run your Python script or Celery worker
163: python your_script.py
164: # or
165: # celery -A your_app_module worker --loglevel=info
166: ```
167: 
168: Celery automatically picks up these environment variables. They often take precedence over settings defined in a configuration file or directly on the app, making them ideal for overriding settings in different environments (development, staging, production).
169: 
170: *Note: The exact precedence order can sometimes depend on how and when configuration is loaded, but environment variables are generally a high-priority source.*
171: 
172: ## How It Works Internally (Simplified View)
173: 
174: 1.  **Loading:** When you create a `Celery` app or call `app.config_from_object()`, Celery reads the settings from the specified source (arguments, object/module, environment variables).
175: 2.  **Storing:** These settings are stored in a dictionary-like object accessible via `app.conf`. Celery uses a default set of values initially, which are then updated or overridden by your configuration.
176: 3.  **Accessing:** When a Celery component needs a setting (e.g., the worker needs the `broker_url` to connect, or a task needs the `task_serializer`), it simply looks up the required key in the `app.conf` object.

195:     Worker->>Broker: Connect using 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
196: ```
197: 
198: This diagram shows the app loading configuration first, and then the worker using that stored configuration (`app.conf`) to perform its duties, like connecting to the broker.
199: 
200: ## Code Dive: Where Configuration Lives
201: 
202: *   **`app.conf`:** This is the primary interface you interact with. It's an instance of a special dictionary-like class (`celery.app.utils.Settings`) that handles loading defaults, converting keys (Celery has changed setting names over time), and providing convenient access. You saw this in the direct update example: `app.conf.update(...)`.
203: *   **Loading Logic (`config_from_object`)**: Methods like `app.config_from_object` typically delegate to the app's "loader" (`app.loader`). The loader (e.g., `celery.loaders.base.BaseLoader` or `celery.loaders.app.AppLoader`) handles the actual importing of the configuration module and extracting the settings. See `loaders/base.py` for the `config_from_object` method definition.
204: *   **Default Settings**: Celery has a built-in set of default values for all its settings. These are defined in `celery.app.defaults`. Your configuration overrides these defaults. See `app/defaults.py`.
205: *   **Accessing Settings**: Throughout the Celery codebase, different components access the configuration via `app.conf`. For instance, when sending a task (`app/base.py:send_task`), the code looks up `app.conf.broker_url` (or related settings) to know where and how to send the message.
206: 
207: ```python
208: # Simplified concept from loaders/base.py
209: class BaseLoader:
210:     # ...
211:     def config_from_object(self, obj, silent=False):
212:         if isinstance(obj, str):
213:             # Import the module (e.g., 'celeryconfig')
214:             obj = self._smart_import(obj, imp=self.import_from_cwd)
215:             # ... error handling ...
216:         # Store the configuration (simplified - actual process merges)
217:         self._conf = force_mapping(obj) # Treat obj like a dictionary
218:         # ...
219:         return True
220: 
221: # Simplified concept from app/base.py (where settings are used)
222: class Celery:
223:     # ...
224:     def send_task(self, name, args=None, kwargs=None, **options):
225:         # ... other setup ...
226: 
227:         # Access configuration to know where the broker is
228:         broker_connection_url = self.conf.broker_url # Reads from app.conf
229: 
230:         # Use the broker URL to get a connection/producer
231:         with self.producer_or_acquire(producer) as P:
232:              # ... create message ...
233:              # Send message using the connection derived from broker_url
234:              self.amqp.send_task_message(P, name, message, **options)
235: 
236:         # ... return result object ...
237: ```
238: 
239: This illustrates the core idea: load configuration into `app.conf`, then components read from `app.conf` when they need instructions.
240: 
241: ## Conclusion
242: 
243: Configuration is the backbone of Celery's flexibility. You've learned:
244: 
245: *   **Why it's needed:** To tell Celery *how* to operate (broker, backend, tasks settings).
246: *   **What can be configured:** Broker/backend URLs, serializers, timezones, task imports, and much more.
247: *   **How to configure:**
248:     *   Directly via `app.conf.update()`.
249:     *   Using a dedicated module (`celeryconfig.py`) with `app.config_from_object()`. (Recommended)
250:     *   Using environment variables (great for deployment).
251: *   **How it works:** Settings are loaded into `app.conf` and accessed by Celery components as needed.
252: 
253: With your Celery app configured, you're ready to define the actual work you want Celery to do. That's where Tasks come in!

  8: # Chapter 3: Task - The Job Description
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: The Celery App](01_celery_app.md), we set up our Celery headquarters, and in [Chapter 2: Configuration](02_configuration.md), we learned how to give it instructions. Now, we need to define the *actual work* we want Celery to do. This is where **Tasks** come in.
 11: 
 12: ## What Problem Does a Task Solve?
 13: 
 14: Imagine you have a specific job that needs doing, like "Resize this image to thumbnail size" or "Send a welcome email to this new user." In Celery, each of these specific jobs is represented by a **Task**.
 15: 
 16: A Task is like a **job description** or a **recipe**. It contains the exact steps (the code) needed to complete a specific piece of work. You write this recipe once as a Python function, and then you can tell Celery to follow that recipe whenever you need that job done, potentially many times with different inputs (like resizing different images or sending emails to different users).
 17: 
 18: The key benefit is that you don't run the recipe immediately yourself. You hand the recipe (the Task) and the ingredients (the arguments, like the image file or the user's email) over to Celery. Celery then finds an available helper (a [Worker](05_worker.md)) who knows how to follow that specific recipe and lets them do the work in the background. This keeps your main application free to do other things.
 19: 
 20: ## Defining Your First Task
 21: 
 22: Defining a task in Celery is surprisingly simple. You just take a regular Python function and "decorate" it using `@app.task`. Remember our `app` object from [Chapter 1](01_celery_app.md)? We use its `task` decorator.
 23: 
 24: Let's create a file, perhaps named `tasks.py`, to hold our task definitions:
 25: 
 26: ```python
 27: # tasks.py
 28: import time
 29: from celery_app import app # Import the app instance we created
 30: 
 31: @app.task
 32: def add(x, y):
 33:     """A simple task that adds two numbers."""
 34:     print(f"Task 'add' starting with ({x}, {y})")
 35:     # Simulate some work taking time
 36:     time.sleep(5)
 37:     result = x + y
 38:     print(f"Task 'add' finished with result: {result}")
 39:     return result
 40: 
 41: @app.task
 42: def send_welcome_email(user_id):
 43:     """A task simulating sending a welcome email."""
 44:     print(f"Task 'send_welcome_email' starting for user {user_id}")
 45:     # Simulate email sending process
 46:     time.sleep(3)
 47:     print(f"Welcome email supposedly sent to user {user_id}")
 48:     return f"Email sent to {user_id}"
 49: 
 50: # You can have many tasks in one file!
 51: ```
 52: 
 53: **Explanation:**
 54: 
 55: 1.  **`from celery_app import app`**: We import the `Celery` app instance we configured earlier. This instance holds the knowledge about our broker and backend.
 56: 2.  **`@app.task`**: This is the magic decorator! When Celery sees this above a function (`add` or `send_welcome_email`), it says, "Ah! This isn't just a regular function; it's a job description that my workers need to know about."
 57: 3.  **The Function (`add`, `send_welcome_email`)**: This is the actual Python code that performs the work. It's the core of the task – the steps in the recipe. It can take arguments (like `x`, `y`, or `user_id`) and can return a value.
 58: 4.  **Registration**: The `@app.task` decorator automatically *registers* this function with our Celery `app`. Now, `app` knows about a task named `tasks.add` and another named `tasks.send_welcome_email` (Celery creates the name from `module_name.function_name`). Workers connected to this `app` will be able to find and execute this code when requested.
 59: 
 60: *Self-Host Note:* If you are running this code, make sure you have a `celery_app.py` file containing your Celery app instance as shown in previous chapters, and that the `tasks.py` file can import `app` from it.
 61: 
 62: ## Sending a Task for Execution
 63: 
 64: Okay, we've written our recipes (`add` and `send_welcome_email`). How do we tell Celery, "Please run the `add` recipe with the numbers 5 and 7"?
 65: 
 66: We **don't call the function directly** like `add(5, 7)`. If we did that, it would just run immediately in our current program, which defeats the purpose of using Celery!
 67: 
 68: Instead, we use special methods on the task object itself, most commonly `.delay()` or `.apply_async()`.
 69: 
 70: Let's try this in a separate Python script or an interactive Python session:
 71: 
 72: ```python
 73: # run_tasks.py
 74: from tasks import add, send_welcome_email
 75: 
 76: print("Let's send some tasks!")
 77: 
 78: # --- Using .delay() ---
 79: # Tell Celery to run add(5, 7) in the background
 80: result_promise_add = add.delay(5, 7)
 81: print(f"Sent task add(5, 7). Task ID: {result_promise_add.id}")
 82: 
 83: # Tell Celery to run send_welcome_email(123) in the background
 84: result_promise_email = send_welcome_email.delay(123)
 85: print(f"Sent task send_welcome_email(123). Task ID: {result_promise_email.id}")
 86: 
 87: 
 88: # --- Using .apply_async() ---
 89: # Does the same thing as .delay() but allows more options
 90: result_promise_add_later = add.apply_async(args=(10, 20), countdown=10) # Run after 10s
 91: print(f"Sent task add(10, 20) to run in 10s. Task ID: {result_promise_add_later.id}")
 92: 
 93: print("Tasks have been sent to the broker!")
 94: print("A Celery worker needs to be running to pick them up.")
 95: ```
 96: 
 97: **Explanation:**
 98: 
 99: 1.  **`from tasks import add, send_welcome_email`**: We import our *task functions*. Because they were decorated with `@app.task`, they are now special Celery Task objects.
100: 2.  **`add.delay(5, 7)`**: This is the simplest way to send a task.
101:     *   It *doesn't* run `add(5, 7)` right now.
102:     *   It takes the arguments `(5, 7)`.
103:     *   It packages them up into a **message** along with the task's name (`tasks.add`).
104:     *   It sends this message to the **message broker** (like Redis or RabbitMQ) that we configured in our `celery_app.py`. Think of it like dropping a request slip into a mailbox.
105: 3.  **`send_welcome_email.delay(123)`**: Same idea, but for our email task. A message with `tasks.send_welcome_email` and the argument `123` is sent to the broker.
106: 4.  **`add.apply_async(args=(10, 20), countdown=10)`**: This is a more powerful way to send tasks.
107:     *   It does the same fundamental thing: sends a message to the broker.
108:     *   It allows for more options, like `args` (positional arguments as a tuple), `kwargs` (keyword arguments as a dict), `countdown` (delay execution by seconds), `eta` (run at a specific future time), and many others.
109:     *   `.delay(*args, **kwargs)` is just a convenient shortcut for `.apply_async(args=args, kwargs=kwargs)`.
110: 5.  **`result_promise_... = ...`**: Both `.delay()` and `apply_async()` return an `AsyncResult` object immediately. This is *not* the actual result of the task (like `12` for `add(5, 7)`). It's more like a receipt or a tracking number (notice the `.id` attribute). You can use this object later to check if the task finished and what its result was, but only if you've set up a [Result Backend](06_result_backend.md) (Chapter 6).
111: 6.  **The Worker**: Sending the task only puts the message on the queue. A separate process, the Celery [Worker](05_worker.md) (Chapter 5), needs to be running. The worker constantly watches the queue, picks up messages, finds the corresponding task function (using the name like `tasks.add`), and executes it with the provided arguments.
112: 
113: ## How It Works Internally (Simplified)
114: 
115: Let's trace the journey of defining and sending our `add` task:
116: 
117: 1.  **Definition (`@app.task` in `tasks.py`)**:
118:     *   Python defines the `add` function.
119:     *   The `@app.task` decorator sees this function.
120:     *   It tells the `Celery` instance (`app`) about this function, registering it under the name `tasks.add` in an internal dictionary (`app.tasks`). The `app` instance knows the broker/backend settings.
121: 2.  **Sending (`add.delay(5, 7)` in `run_tasks.py`)**:
122:     *   You call `.delay()` on the `add` task object.
123:     *   `.delay()` (or `.apply_async()`) internally uses the `app` the task is bound to.
124:     *   It asks the `app` for the configured broker URL.
125:     *   It creates a message containing:
126:         *   Task Name: `tasks.add`
127:         *   Arguments: `(5, 7)`
128:         *   Other options (like a unique Task ID).
129:     *   It connects to the **Broker** (e.g., Redis) using the broker URL.
130:     *   It sends the message to a specific queue (usually named 'celery' by default) on the broker.
131:     *   It returns an `AsyncResult` object referencing the Task ID.
132: 3.  **Waiting**: The message sits in the queue on the broker, waiting.
133: 4.  **Execution (by a [Worker](05_worker.md))**:
134:     *   A separate Celery Worker process is running, connected to the same broker and `app`.
135:     *   The Worker fetches the message from the queue.
136:     *   It reads the task name: `tasks.add`.
137:     *   It looks up `tasks.add` in its copy of the `app.tasks` registry to find the actual `add` function code.
138:     *   It calls the `add` function with the arguments from the message: `add(5, 7)`.
139:     *   The function runs (prints logs, sleeps, calculates `12`).
140:     *   If a [Result Backend](06_result_backend.md) is configured, the Worker takes the return value (`12`) and stores it in the backend, associated with the Task ID.
141:     *   The Worker acknowledges the message to the broker, removing it from the queue.

167: ```
168: 
169: ## Code Dive: Task Creation and Sending
170: 
171: *   **Task Definition (`@app.task`)**: This decorator is defined in `celery/app/base.py` within the `Celery` class method `task`. It ultimately calls `_task_from_fun`.
172: 
173:     ```python
174:     # Simplified from celery/app/base.py
175:     class Celery:
176:         # ...
177:         def task(self, *args, **opts):
178:             # ... handles decorator arguments ...
179:             def _create_task_cls(fun):
180:                 # Returns a Task instance or a Proxy that creates one later
181:                 ret = self._task_from_fun(fun, **opts)
182:                 return ret
183:             return _create_task_cls
184: 
185:         def _task_from_fun(self, fun, name=None, base=None, bind=False, **options):
186:             # Generate name like 'tasks.add' if not given
187:             name = name or self.gen_task_name(fun.__name__, fun.__module__)
188:             base = base or self.Task # The base Task class (from celery.app.task)
189: 
190:             if name not in self._tasks: # If not already registered...
191:                 # Dynamically create a Task class wrapping the function
192:                 task = type(fun.__name__, (base,), {
193:                     'app': self, # Link task back to this app instance!
194:                     'name': name,
195:                     'run': staticmethod(fun), # The actual function to run
196:                     '__doc__': fun.__doc__,
197:                     '__module__': fun.__module__,
198:                     # ... other options ...
199:                 })() # Instantiate the new Task class
200:                 self._tasks[task.name] = task # Add to app's registry!
201:                 task.bind(self) # Perform binding steps
202:             else:
203:                 task = self._tasks[name] # Task already exists
204:             return task
205:     ```
206:     This shows how the decorator essentially creates a specialized object (an instance of a class derived from `celery.app.task.Task`) that wraps your original function and registers it with the `app` under a specific name.
207: 
208: *   **Task Sending (`.delay`)**: The `.delay()` method is defined on the `Task` class itself in `celery/app/task.py`. It's a simple shortcut.
209: 
210:     ```python
211:     # Simplified from celery/app/task.py
212:     class Task:
213:         # ...
214:         def delay(self, *args, **kwargs):
215:             """Shortcut for apply_async(args, kwargs)"""
216:             return self.apply_async(args, kwargs)
217: 
218:         def apply_async(self, args=None, kwargs=None, ..., **options):
219:             # ... argument checking, option processing ...
220: 
221:             # Get the app associated with this task instance
222:             app = self._get_app()
223: 
224:             # If always_eager is set, run locally instead of sending
225:             if app.conf.task_always_eager:
226:                 return self.apply(args, kwargs, ...) # Runs inline
227: 
228:             # The main path: tell the app to send the task message
229:             return app.send_task(
230:                 self.name, args, kwargs, task_type=self,
231:                 **options # Includes things like countdown, eta, queue etc.
232:             )
233:     ```
234:     You can see how `.delay` just calls `.apply_async`, which then (usually) delegates the actual message sending to the `app.send_task` method we saw briefly in [Chapter 1](01_celery_app.md). The `app` uses its configuration to know *how* and *where* to send the message.
235: 
236: ## Conclusion
237: 
238: You've learned the core concept of a Celery **Task**:
239: 
240: *   It represents a single, well-defined **unit of work** or **job description**.
241: *   You define a task by decorating a normal Python function with `@app.task`. This **registers** the task with your Celery application.
242: *   You **send** a task request (not run it directly) using `.delay()` or `.apply_async()`.
243: *   Sending a task puts a **message** onto a queue managed by a **message broker**.
244: *   A separate **Worker** process picks up the message and executes the corresponding task function.
245: 
246: Tasks are the fundamental building blocks of work in Celery. Now that you know how to define a task and request its execution, let's look more closely at the crucial component that handles passing these requests around: the message broker.

  8: # Chapter 4: Broker Connection (AMQP) - Celery's Postal Service
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 3: Task](03_task.md), we learned how to define "job descriptions" (Tasks) like `add(x, y)` and how to request them using `.delay()`. But when you call `add.delay(2, 2)`, how does that request actually *get* to a worker process that can perform the addition? It doesn't just magically appear!
 11: 
 12: This is where the **Broker Connection** comes in. Think of it as Celery's built-in postal service.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does the Broker Connection Solve?
 15: 
 16: Imagine you want to send a letter (a task request) to a friend (a worker) who lives in another city. You can't just shout the message out your window and hope they hear it. You need:
 17: 
 18: 1.  A **Post Office** (the Message Broker, like RabbitMQ or Redis) that handles mail.
 19: 2.  A way to **talk to the Post Office** (the Broker Connection) to drop off your letter or pick up mail addressed to you.
 20: 
 21: The Broker Connection is that crucial link between your application (where you call `.delay()`) or your Celery worker and the message broker system. It manages sending messages *to* the broker and receiving messages *from* the broker reliably.
 22: 
 23: Without this connection, your task requests would never leave your application, and your workers would never know there's work waiting for them.
 24: 
 25: ## Key Concepts: Post Office & Rules
 26: 
 27: Let's break down the pieces:
 28: 
 29: 1.  **The Message Broker (The Post Office):** This is a separate piece of software that acts as a central hub for messages. Common choices are RabbitMQ and Redis. You tell Celery its address using the `broker_url` setting in your [Configuration](02_configuration.md).
 30:     ```python
 31:     # From Chapter 2 - celeryconfig.py
 32:     broker_url = 'amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//' # Example for RabbitMQ
 33:     # Or maybe: broker_url = 'redis://localhost:6379/0' # Example for Redis
 34:     ```
 35: 
 36: 2.  **The Connection (Talking to the Staff):** This is the active communication channel established between your Python code (either your main app or a worker) and the broker. It's like having an open phone line to the post office. Celery, using a library called `kombu`, handles creating and managing these connections based on the `broker_url`.
 37: 
 38: 3.  **AMQP (The Postal Rules):** AMQP stands for **Advanced Message Queuing Protocol**. Think of it as a specific set of rules and procedures for how post offices should operate – how letters should be addressed, sorted, delivered, and confirmed.
 39:     *   RabbitMQ is a broker that speaks AMQP natively.
 40:     *   Other brokers, like Redis, use different protocols (their own set of rules).
 41:     *   **Why mention AMQP?** It's a very common and powerful protocol for message queuing, and the principles behind it (exchanges, queues, routing) are fundamental to how Celery routes tasks, even when using other brokers. Celery's internal component for handling this communication is often referred to as `app.amqp` (found in `app/amqp.py`), even though the underlying library (`kombu`) supports multiple protocols. So, we focus on the *concept* of managing the broker connection, often using AMQP terminology as a reference point.
 42: 
 43: 4.  **Producer (Sending Mail):** When your application calls `add.delay(2, 2)`, it acts as a *producer*. It uses its broker connection to send a message ("Please run 'add' with arguments (2, 2)") to the broker.
 44: 
 45: 5.  **Consumer (Receiving Mail):** A Celery [Worker](05_worker.md) acts as a *consumer*. It uses its *own* broker connection to constantly check a specific mailbox (queue) at the broker for new messages. When it finds one, it takes it, performs the task, and tells the broker it's done.
 46: 
 47: ## How Sending a Task Uses the Connection
 48: 
 49: Let's revisit sending a task from [Chapter 3: Task](03_task.md):
 50: 
 51: ```python
 52: # run_tasks.py (simplified)
 53: from tasks import add
 54: from celery_app import app # Assume app is configured with a broker_url
 55: 
 56: # 1. You call .delay()
 57: print("Sending task...")
 58: result_promise = add.delay(2, 2)
 59: # Behind the scenes:
 60: # a. Celery looks at the 'add' task, finds its associated 'app'.
 61: # b. It asks 'app' for the broker_url from its configuration.
 62: # c. It uses the app.amqp component (powered by Kombu) to get a connection
 63: #    to the broker specified by the URL (e.g., 'amqp://localhost...').
 64: # d. It packages the task name 'tasks.add' and args (2, 2) into a message.
 65: # e. It uses the connection to 'publish' (send) the message to the broker.
 66: 
 67: print(f"Task sent! ID: {result_promise.id}")
 68: ```
 69: 
 70: The `add.delay(2, 2)` call triggers this whole process. It needs the configured `broker_url` to know *which* post office to connect to, and the broker connection handles the actual sending of the "letter" (task message).
 71: 
 72: Similarly, a running Celery [Worker](05_worker.md) establishes its own connection to the *same* broker. It uses this connection to *listen* for incoming messages on the queues it's assigned to.
 73: 
 74: ## How It Works Internally (Simplified)
 75: 
 76: Celery uses a powerful library called **Kombu** to handle the low-level details of connecting and talking to different types of brokers (RabbitMQ, Redis, etc.). The `app.amqp` object in Celery acts as a high-level interface to Kombu's features.
 77: 
 78: 1.  **Configuration:** The `broker_url` tells Kombu where and how to connect.
 79: 2.  **Connection Pool:** To be efficient, Celery (via Kombu) often maintains a *pool* of connections. When you send a task, it might grab an existing, idle connection from the pool instead of creating a new one every time. This is faster. You can see this managed by `app.producer_pool` in `app/base.py`.
 80: 3.  **Producer:** When `task.delay()` is called, it ultimately uses a `kombu.Producer` object. This object represents the ability to *send* messages. It's tied to a specific connection and channel.
 81: 4.  **Publishing:** The producer's `publish()` method is called. This takes the task message (already serialized into a format like JSON), specifies the destination (exchange and routing key - think of these like the address and sorting code on an envelope), and sends it over the connection to the broker.
 82: 5.  **Consumer:** A Worker uses a `kombu.Consumer` object. This object is set up to listen on specific queues via its connection. When a message arrives in one of those queues, the broker pushes it to the consumer over the connection, and the consumer triggers the appropriate Celery task execution logic.
 83: 
 84: ```mermaid

 96:     App->>AppAMQP: Send task message('tasks.add', (2, 2), ...)
 97:     Note over AppAMQP: Gets connection/producer (maybe from pool)
 98:     AppAMQP->>Broker: publish(message, routing_info) via Connection
 99:     Broker-->>AppAMQP: Acknowledge message received
100:     AppAMQP-->>App: Message sent successfully
101:     App-->>Task: Return AsyncResult
102:     Task-->>Client: Return AsyncResult
103: ```
104: 
105: This shows the flow: your code calls `.delay()`, Celery uses its configured connection details (`app.amqp` layer) to get a connection and producer, and then publishes the message to the broker.
106: 
107: ## Code Dive: Sending a Message
108: 
109: Let's peek inside `app/amqp.py` where the `AMQP` class orchestrates sending. The `send_task_message` method (simplified below) is key.
110: 
111: ```python
112: # Simplified from app/amqp.py within the AMQP class
113: 
114: # This function is configured internally and gets called by app.send_task
115: def _create_task_sender(self):
116:     # ... (lots of setup: getting defaults from config, signals) ...
117:     default_serializer = self.app.conf.task_serializer
118:     default_compressor = self.app.conf.task_compression
119: 
120:     def send_task_message(producer, name, message,
121:                           exchange=None, routing_key=None, queue=None,
122:                           serializer=None, compression=None, declare=None,
123:                           retry=None, retry_policy=None,
124:                            **properties):
125:         # ... (Determine exchange, routing_key, queue based on config/options) ...
126:         # ... (Prepare headers, properties, handle retries) ...
127: 
128:         headers, properties, body, sent_event = message # Unpack the prepared message tuple
129: 
130:         # The core action: Use the producer to publish the message!
131:         ret = producer.publish(
132:             body, # The actual task payload (args, kwargs, etc.)
133:             exchange=exchange,
134:             routing_key=routing_key,
135:             serializer=serializer or default_serializer, # e.g., 'json'
136:             compression=compression or default_compressor,
137:             retry=retry,
138:             retry_policy=retry_policy,
139:             declare=declare, # Maybe declare queues/exchanges if needed
140:             headers=headers,
141:             **properties # Other message properties (correlation_id, etc.)
142:         )
143: 
144:         # ... (Send signals like task_sent, publish events if configured) ...
145:         return ret
146:     return send_task_message
147: ```
148: 
149: **Explanation:**
150: 
151: *   This function takes a `producer` object (which is linked to a broker connection via Kombu).
152: *   It figures out the final destination details (exchange, routing key).
153: *   It calls `producer.publish()`, passing the task body and all the necessary options (like serializer). This is the function that actually sends the data over the network connection to the broker.
154: 
155: The `Connection` objects themselves are managed by Kombu (see `kombu/connection.py`). Celery uses these objects via its `app.connection_for_write()` or `app.connection_for_read()` methods, which often pull from the connection pool (`kombu.pools`).
156: 
157: ## Conclusion
158: 
159: The Broker Connection is Celery's vital communication link, its "postal service."
160: 
161: *   It connects your application and workers to the **Message Broker** (like RabbitMQ or Redis).
162: *   It uses the `broker_url` from your [Configuration](02_configuration.md) to know where to connect.
163: *   Protocols like **AMQP** define the "rules" for communication, although Celery's underlying library (Kombu) handles various protocols.
164: *   Your app **produces** task messages and sends them over the connection.
165: *   Workers **consume** task messages received over their connection.
166: *   Celery manages connections efficiently, often using **pools**.
167: 
168: Understanding the broker connection helps clarify how tasks move from where they're requested to where they run. Now that we know how tasks are defined and sent across the wire, let's look at the entity that actually picks them up and does the work.

  8: # Chapter 5: Worker - The Task Doer
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 4: Broker Connection (AMQP)](04_broker_connection__amqp_.md), we learned how Celery uses a message broker, like a postal service, to send task messages. When you call `add.delay(2, 2)`, a message asking to run the `add` task with arguments `(2, 2)` gets dropped into a mailbox (the broker queue).
 11: 
 12: But who actually checks that mailbox, picks up the message, and performs the addition? That's the job of the **Celery Worker**.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does the Worker Solve?
 15: 
 16: Imagine our workshop analogy again. You've defined the blueprint for a job ([Task](03_task.md)) and you've dropped the work order into the central inbox ([Broker Connection (AMQP)](04_broker_connection__amqp_.md)). Now you need an actual employee or a machine to:
 17: 
 18: 1.  Look in the inbox for new work orders.
 19: 2.  Pick up an order.
 20: 3.  Follow the instructions (run the task code).
 21: 4.  Maybe put the finished product (the result) somewhere specific.
 22: 5.  Mark the order as complete.
 23: 
 24: The **Celery Worker** is that employee or machine. It's a separate program (process) that you run, whose sole purpose is to execute the tasks you send to the broker. Without a worker running, your task messages would just sit in the queue forever, waiting for someone to process them.
 25: 
 26: ## Starting Your First Worker
 27: 
 28: Running a worker is typically done from your command line or terminal. You need to tell the worker where to find your [Celery App](01_celery_app.md) instance (which holds the configuration, including the broker address and the list of known tasks).
 29: 
 30: Assuming you have:
 31: *   A file `celery_app.py` containing your `app = Celery(...)` instance.
 32: *   A file `tasks.py` containing your task definitions (like `add` and `send_welcome_email`) decorated with `@app.task`.
 33: *   Your message broker (e.g., Redis or RabbitMQ) running.
 34: 
 35: You can start a worker like this:
 36: 
 37: ```bash
 38: # In your terminal, in the same directory as celery_app.py and tasks.py
 39: # Make sure your Python environment has celery and the broker driver installed
 40: # (e.g., pip install celery redis)
 41: 
 42: celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info
 43: ```
 44: 
 45: **Explanation:**
 46: 
 47: *   `celery`: This is the main Celery command-line program.
 48: *   `-A celery_app`: The `-A` flag (or `--app`) tells Celery where to find your `Celery` app instance. `celery_app` refers to the `celery_app.py` file (or module) and implies Celery should look for an instance named `app` inside it.
 49: *   `worker`: This specifies that you want to run the worker component.
 50: *   `--loglevel=info`: This sets the logging level. `info` is a good starting point, showing you when the worker connects, finds tasks, and executes them. Other levels include `debug` (more verbose), `warning`, `error`, and `critical`.
 51: 
 52: **What You'll See:**
 53: 
 54: When the worker starts successfully, you'll see a banner like this (details may vary):

 80: ```
 81: 
 82: **Key Parts of the Banner:**
 83: 
 84: *   `celery@yourhostname`: The unique name of this worker instance.
 85: *   `transport`: The broker URL it connected to (from your app config).
 86: *   `results`: The result backend URL (if configured).
 87: *   `concurrency`: How many tasks this worker can potentially run at once (defaults to the number of CPU cores) and the execution pool type (`prefork` is common). We'll touch on this later.
 88: *   `queues`: The specific "mailboxes" (queues) the worker is listening to. `celery` is the default queue name.
 89: *   `[tasks]`: A list of all the tasks the worker discovered (like our `tasks.add` and `tasks.send_welcome_email`). If your tasks don't show up here, the worker won't be able to run them!
 90: 
 91: The final `celery@yourhostname ready.` message means the worker is connected and waiting for jobs!
 92: 
 93: ## What the Worker Does
 94: 
 95: Now that the worker is running, let's trace what happens when you send a task (e.g., from `run_tasks.py` in [Chapter 3: Task](03_task.md)):
 96: 
 97: 1.  **Waiting:** The worker is connected to the broker, listening on the `celery` queue.
 98: 2.  **Message Arrival:** Your `add.delay(5, 7)` call sends a message to the `celery` queue on the broker. The broker notifies the worker.
 99: 3.  **Receive & Decode:** The worker receives the raw message. It decodes it to find the task name (`tasks.add`), the arguments (`(5, 7)`), and other info (like a unique task ID).
100: 4.  **Find Task Code:** The worker looks up the name `tasks.add` in its internal registry (populated when it started) to find the actual Python function `add` defined in `tasks.py`.
101: 5.  **Execute:** The worker executes the function: `add(5, 7)`.
102:     *   You will see the `print` statements from your task function appear in the *worker's* terminal output:
103:         ```text
104:         [2023-10-27 10:05:00,100: INFO/ForkPoolWorker-1] Task tasks.add[some-task-id] received
105:         Task 'add' starting with (5, 7)
106:         Task 'add' finished with result: 12
107:         [2023-10-27 10:05:05,150: INFO/ForkPoolWorker-1] Task tasks.add[some-task-id] succeeded in 5.05s: 12
108:         ```
109: 6.  **Store Result (Optional):** If a [Result Backend](06_result_backend.md) is configured, the worker takes the return value (`12`) and sends it to the backend, associating it with the task's unique ID.
110: 7.  **Acknowledge:** The worker sends an "acknowledgement" (ack) back to the broker. This tells the broker, "I finished processing this message successfully, you can delete it from the queue." This ensures tasks aren't lost if a worker crashes mid-execution (the message would remain on the queue for another worker to pick up).
111: 8.  **Wait Again:** The worker goes back to waiting for the next message.
112: 
113: ## Running Multiple Workers and Concurrency
114: 
115: *   **Multiple Workers:** You can start multiple worker processes by running the `celery worker` command again, perhaps on different machines or in different terminals on the same machine. They will all connect to the same broker and pull tasks from the queue, allowing you to process tasks in parallel and scale your application.
116: *   **Concurrency within a Worker:** A single worker process can often handle more than one task concurrently. Celery achieves this using *execution pools*.
117:     *   **Prefork (Default):** The worker starts several child *processes*. Each child process handles one task at a time. The `-c` (or `--concurrency`) flag controls the number of child processes (default is the number of CPU cores). This is good for CPU-bound tasks.
118:     *   **Eventlet/Gevent:** Uses *green threads* (lightweight concurrency managed by libraries like eventlet or gevent). A single worker process can handle potentially hundreds or thousands of tasks concurrently, especially if the tasks are I/O-bound (e.g., waiting for network requests). You select these using the `-P` flag: `celery -A celery_app worker -P eventlet -c 1000`. Requires installing the respective library (`pip install eventlet` or `pip install gevent`).
119:     *   **Solo:** Executes tasks one after another in the main worker process. Useful for debugging. `-P solo`.
120:     *   **Threads:** Uses regular OS threads. `-P threads`. Less common for Celery tasks due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitations for CPU-bound tasks, but can be useful for I/O-bound tasks.
121: 
122: For beginners, sticking with the default **prefork** pool is usually fine. Just know that the worker can likely handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
123: 
124: ## How It Works Internally (Simplified)
125: 
126: Let's visualize the worker's main job: processing a single task.
127: 
128: 1.  **Startup:** The `celery worker` command starts the main worker process. It loads the `Celery App`, reads the configuration (`broker_url`, tasks to import, etc.).
129: 2.  **Connect & Listen:** The worker establishes a connection to the message broker and tells it, "I'm ready to consume messages from the 'celery' queue."
130: 3.  **Message Delivery:** The broker sees a message for the 'celery' queue (sent by `add.delay(5, 7)`) and delivers it to the connected worker.
131: 4.  **Consumer Receives:** The worker's internal "Consumer" component receives the message.
132: 5.  **Task Dispatch:** The Consumer decodes the message, identifies the task (`tasks.add`), and finds the arguments (`(5, 7)`). It then hands this off to the configured execution pool (e.g., prefork).
133: 6.  **Pool Execution:** The pool (e.g., a child process in the prefork pool) gets the task function and arguments and executes `add(5, 7)`.
134: 7.  **Result Return:** The pool process finishes execution and returns the result (`12`) back to the main worker process.
135: 8.  **Result Handling (Optional):** The main worker process, if a [Result Backend](06_result_backend.md) is configured, sends the result (`12`) and task ID to the backend store.
136: 9.  **Acknowledgement:** The main worker process sends an "ack" message back to the broker, confirming the task message was successfully processed. The broker then deletes the message.

161: ## Code Dive: Where Worker Logic Lives
162: 
163: *   **Command Line Entry Point (`celery/bin/worker.py`):** This script handles parsing the command-line arguments (`-A`, `-l`, `-c`, `-P`, etc.) when you run `celery worker ...`. It ultimately creates and starts a `WorkController` instance. (See `worker()` function in the file).
164: *   **Main Worker Class (`celery/worker/worker.py`):** The `WorkController` class is the heart of the worker. It manages all the different components (like the pool, consumer, timer, etc.) using a system called "bootsteps". It handles the overall startup, shutdown, and coordination. (See `WorkController` class).
165: *   **Message Handling (`celery/worker/consumer/consumer.py`):** The `Consumer` class (specifically its `Blueprint` and steps like `Tasks` and `Evloop`) is responsible for the core loop of fetching messages from the broker via the connection, decoding them, and dispatching them to the execution pool using task strategies. (See `Consumer.create_task_handler`).
166: *   **Execution Pools (`celery/concurrency/`):** Modules like `prefork.py`, `solo.py`, `eventlet.py`, `gevent.py` implement the different concurrency models (`-P` flag). The `WorkController` selects and manages one of these pools.
167: 
168: A highly simplified conceptual view of the core message processing logic within the `Consumer`:
169: 
170: ```python
171: # Conceptual loop inside the Consumer (highly simplified)
172: 
173: def message_handler(message):
174:     try:
175:         # 1. Decode message (task name, args, kwargs, id, etc.)
176:         task_name, args, kwargs, task_id = decode_message(message.body, message.headers)
177: 
178:         # 2. Find the registered task function
179:         task_func = app.tasks[task_name]
180: 
181:         # 3. Prepare execution request for the pool
182:         request = TaskRequest(task_id, task_name, task_func, args, kwargs)
183: 
184:         # 4. Send request to the pool for execution
185:         #    (Pool runs request.execute() which calls task_func(*args, **kwargs))
186:         pool.apply_async(request.execute, accept_callback=task_succeeded, ...)
187: 
188:     except Exception as e:
189:         # Handle errors (e.g., unknown task, decoding error)
190:         log_error(e)
191:         message.reject() # Tell broker it failed
192: 
193: def task_succeeded(task_id, retval):
194:     # Called by the pool when task finishes successfully
195:     # 5. Store result (optional)
196:     if app.backend:
197:         app.backend.store_result(task_id, retval, status='SUCCESS')
198: 
199:     # 6. Acknowledge message to broker
200:     message.ack()
201: 
202: # --- Setup ---
203: # Worker connects to broker and registers message_handler
204: # for incoming messages on the subscribed queue(s)
205: connection.consume(queue_name, callback=message_handler)
206: 
207: # Start the event loop to wait for messages
208: connection.drain_events()
209: ```
210: 
211: This illustrates the fundamental cycle: receive -> decode -> find task -> execute via pool -> handle result -> acknowledge. The actual code involves much more detail regarding error handling, state management, different protocols, rate limiting, etc., managed through the bootstep system.
212: 
213: ## Conclusion
214: 
215: You've now met the **Celery Worker**, the essential component that actually *runs* your tasks.
216: 
217: *   It's a **separate process** you start from the command line (`celery worker`).
218: *   It connects to the **broker** using the configuration from your **Celery App**.
219: *   It **listens** for task messages on queues.
220: *   It **executes** the corresponding task code when a message arrives.
221: *   It handles **concurrency** using execution pools (like prefork, eventlet, gevent).
222: *   It **acknowledges** messages to the broker upon successful completion.
223: 
224: Without workers, Celery tasks would never get done. But what happens when a task finishes? What if it returns a value, like our `add` task returning `12`? How can your original application find out the result? That's where the Result Backend comes in.

  8: # Chapter 6: Result Backend - Checking Your Task's Homework
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 5: Worker](05_worker.md), we met the Celery Worker, the diligent entity that picks up task messages from the [Broker Connection (AMQP)](04_broker_connection__amqp_.md) and executes the code defined in our [Task](03_task.md).
 11: 
 12: But what happens after the worker finishes a task? What if the task was supposed to calculate something, like `add(2, 2)`? How do we, back in our main application, find out the answer (`4`)? Or even just know if the task finished successfully or failed?
 13: 
 14: This is where the **Result Backend** comes in. It's like a dedicated place to check the status and results of the homework assigned to the workers.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Does the Result Backend Solve?
 17: 
 18: Imagine you give your Celery worker a math problem: "What is 123 + 456?". The worker goes away, calculates the answer (579), and... then what?
 19: 
 20: If you don't tell the worker *where* to put the answer, it just disappears! You, back in your main program, have no idea if the worker finished, if it got the right answer, or if it encountered an error.
 21: 
 22: The **Result Backend** solves this by providing a storage location (like a database, a cache like Redis, or even via the message broker itself) where the worker can:
 23: 
 24: 1.  Record the final **state** of the task (e.g., `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`).
 25: 2.  Store the task's **return value** (e.g., `579`) if it succeeded.
 26: 3.  Store the **error** information (e.g., `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s)...`) if it failed.
 27: 
 28: Later, your main application can query this Result Backend using the task's unique ID to retrieve this information.
 29: 
 30: Think of it as a shared filing cabinet:
 31: *   The **Worker** puts the completed homework (result and status) into a specific folder (identified by the task ID).
 32: *   Your **Application** can later look inside that folder (using the task ID) to see the results.
 33: 
 34: ## Key Concepts
 35: 
 36: 1.  **Storage:** It's a place to store task results and states. This could be Redis, a relational database (like PostgreSQL or MySQL), MongoDB, RabbitMQ (using RPC), and others.
 37: 2.  **Task ID:** Each task execution gets a unique ID (remember the `result_promise_add.id` from Chapter 3?). This ID is the key used to store and retrieve the result from the backend.
 38: 3.  **State:** Besides the return value, the backend stores the task's current state (e.g., `PENDING`, `STARTED`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `RETRY`, `REVOKED`).
 39: 4.  **Return Value / Exception:** If the task finishes successfully (`SUCCESS`), the backend stores the value the task function returned. If it fails (`FAILURE`), it stores details about the exception that occurred.
 40: 5.  **`AsyncResult` Object:** When you call `task.delay()` or `task.apply_async()`, Celery gives you back an `AsyncResult` object. This object holds the task's ID and provides methods to interact with the result backend (check status, get the result, etc.).
 41: 
 42: ## How to Use a Result Backend
 43: 
 44: **1. Configure It!**
 45: 
 46: First, you need to tell your Celery app *where* the result backend is located. You do this using the `result_backend` configuration setting, just like you set the `broker_url` in [Chapter 2: Configuration](02_configuration.md).
 47: 
 48: Let's configure our app to use Redis (make sure you have Redis running!) as the result backend. We'll use database number `1` for results to keep it separate from the broker which might be using database `0`.
 49: 
 50: ```python
 51: # celery_app.py
 52: from celery import Celery
 53: 
 54: # Configure BOTH broker and result backend
 55: app = Celery('tasks',
 56:              broker='redis://localhost:6379/0',
 57:              backend='redis://localhost:6379/1') # <-- Result Backend URL
 58: 
 59: # You could also use app.config_from_object('celeryconfig')
 60: # if result_backend = 'redis://localhost:6379/1' is in celeryconfig.py
 61: 
 62: # ... your task definitions (@app.task) would go here or be imported ...
 63: @app.task
 64: def add(x, y):
 65:     import time
 66:     time.sleep(3) # Simulate work
 67:     return x + y
 68: 
 69: @app.task
 70: def fail_sometimes(x):
 71:     import random
 72:     if random.random() < 0.5:
 73:         raise ValueError("Something went wrong!")
 74:     return f"Processed {x}"
 75: ```
 76: 
 77: **Explanation:**
 78: 
 79: *   `backend='redis://localhost:6379/1'`: We provide a URL telling Celery to use the Redis server running on `localhost`, port `6379`, and specifically database `1` for storing results. (The `backend` argument is an alias for `result_backend`).
 80: 
 81: **2. Send a Task and Get the `AsyncResult`**
 82: 
 83: When you send a task, the returned object is your key to the result.
 84: 
 85: ```python
 86: # run_tasks.py
 87: from celery_app import add, fail_sometimes
 88: 
 89: # Send the add task
 90: result_add = add.delay(10, 20)
 91: print(f"Sent task add(10, 20). Task ID: {result_add.id}")
 92: 
 93: # Send the task that might fail
 94: result_fail = fail_sometimes.delay("my data")
 95: print(f"Sent task fail_sometimes('my data'). Task ID: {result_fail.id}")
 96: ```
 97: 
 98: **Explanation:**
 99: 
100: *   `result_add` and `result_fail` are `AsyncResult` objects. They contain the `.id` attribute, which is the unique identifier for *this specific execution* of the task.
101: 
102: **3. Check the Status and Get the Result**
103: 
104: Now, you can use the `AsyncResult` object to interact with the result backend.
105: 
106: **(Run a worker in another terminal first: `celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info`)**
107: 
108: ```python
109: # continue in run_tasks.py or a new Python session
110: from celery_app import app # Need app for AsyncResult if creating from ID
111: 
112: # Use the AsyncResult objects we got earlier
113: # Or, if you only have the ID, you can recreate the AsyncResult:
114: # result_add = app.AsyncResult('the-task-id-you-saved-earlier')
115: 
116: print(f"\nChecking results for add task ({result_add.id})...")
117: 
118: # Check if the task is finished (returns True/False immediately)
119: print(f"Is add ready? {result_add.ready()}")
120: 
121: # Check the state (returns 'PENDING', 'STARTED', 'SUCCESS', 'FAILURE', etc.)
122: print(f"State of add: {result_add.state}")
123: 
124: # Get the result. IMPORTANT: This call will BLOCK until the task is finished!
125: # If the task failed, this will raise the exception that occurred in the worker.
126: try:
127:     # Set a timeout (in seconds) to avoid waiting forever
128:     final_result = result_add.get(timeout=10)
129:     print(f"Result of add: {final_result}")
130:     print(f"Did add succeed? {result_add.successful()}")
131:     print(f"Final state of add: {result_add.state}")
132: except Exception as e:
133:     print(f"Could not get result for add: {type(e).__name__} - {e}")
134:     print(f"Final state of add: {result_add.state}")
135:     print(f"Did add fail? {result_add.failed()}")
136:     # Get the traceback if it failed
137:     print(f"Traceback: {result_add.traceback}")
138: 
139: 
140: print(f"\nChecking results for fail_sometimes task ({result_fail.id})...")
141: try:
142:     # Wait up to 10 seconds for this task
143:     fail_result = result_fail.get(timeout=10)
144:     print(f"Result of fail_sometimes: {fail_result}")
145:     print(f"Did fail_sometimes succeed? {result_fail.successful()}")
146:     print(f"Final state of fail_sometimes: {result_fail.state}")
147: except Exception as e:
148:     print(f"Could not get result for fail_sometimes: {type(e).__name__} - {e}")
149:     print(f"Final state of fail_sometimes: {result_fail.state}")
150:     print(f"Did fail_sometimes fail? {result_fail.failed()}")
151:     print(f"Traceback:\n{result_fail.traceback}")
152: 
153: ```
154: 
155: **Explanation & Potential Output:**
156: 
157: *   `result.ready()`: Checks if the task has finished (reached a `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, or other final state). Non-blocking.
158: *   `result.state`: Gets the current state string. Non-blocking.
159: *   `result.successful()`: Returns `True` if the state is `SUCCESS`. Non-blocking.
160: *   `result.failed()`: Returns `True` if the state is `FAILURE` or another exception state. Non-blocking.
161: *   `result.get(timeout=...)`: This is the most common way to get the actual return value.
162:     *   **It blocks** (waits) until the task completes *or* the timeout expires.
163:     *   If the task state becomes `SUCCESS`, it returns the value the task function returned (e.g., `30`).
164:     *   If the task state becomes `FAILURE`, it **raises** the exception that occurred in the worker (e.g., `ValueError: Something went wrong!`).
165:     *   If the timeout is reached before the task finishes, it raises a `celery.exceptions.TimeoutError`.
166: *   `result.traceback`: If the task failed, this contains the error traceback string from the worker.

195: 
196: ## How It Works Internally
197: 
198: 1.  **Task Sent:** Your application calls `add.delay(10, 20)`. It sends a message to the **Broker** and gets back an `AsyncResult` object containing the unique `task_id`.
199: 2.  **Worker Executes:** A **Worker** picks up the task message from the Broker. It finds the `add` function and executes `add(10, 20)`. The function returns `30`.
200: 3.  **Worker Stores Result:** Because a `result_backend` is configured (`redis://.../1`), the Worker:
201:     *   Connects to the Result Backend (Redis DB 1).
202:     *   Prepares the result data (e.g., `{'status': 'SUCCESS', 'result': 30, 'task_id': 'f5e8...', ...}`).
203:     *   Stores this data in the backend, using the `task_id` as the key (e.g., in Redis, it might set a key like `celery-task-meta-f5e8a3f6-c7b1-4a9e-8f0a-1b2c3d4e5f6a` to the JSON representation of the result data).
204:     *   It might also set an expiry time on the result if configured (`result_expires`).
205: 4.  **Client Checks Result:** Your application calls `result_add.get(timeout=10)` on the `AsyncResult` object.
206: 5.  **Client Queries Backend:** The `AsyncResult` object uses the `task_id` (`f5e8...`) and the configured `result_backend` URL:
207:     *   It connects to the Result Backend (Redis DB 1).
208:     *   It repeatedly fetches the data associated with the `task_id` key (e.g., `GET celery-task-meta-f5e8...` in Redis).
209:     *   It checks the `status` field in the retrieved data.
210:     *   If the status is `PENDING` or `STARTED`, it waits a short interval and tries again, until the timeout is reached.
211:     *   If the status is `SUCCESS`, it extracts the `result` field (`30`) and returns it.
212:     *   If the status is `FAILURE`, it extracts the `result` field (which contains exception info), reconstructs the exception, and raises it.

240: 
241: ## Code Dive: Storing and Retrieving Results
242: 
243: *   **Backend Loading (`celery/app/backends.py`):** When Celery starts, it uses the `result_backend` URL to look up the correct backend class (e.g., `RedisBackend`, `DatabaseBackend`, `RPCBackend`) using functions like `by_url` and `by_name`. These map URL schemes (`redis://`, `db+postgresql://`, `rpc://`) or aliases ('redis', 'db', 'rpc') to the actual Python classes. The mapping is defined in `BACKEND_ALIASES`.
244: *   **Base Classes (`celery/backends/base.py`):** All result backends inherit from `BaseBackend`. Many common backends (like Redis, Memcached) inherit from `BaseKeyValueStoreBackend`, which provides common logic for storing results using keys.
245: *   **Storing Result (`BaseKeyValueStoreBackend._store_result` in `celery/backends/base.py`):** This method (called by the worker) is responsible for actually saving the result.
246: 
247:     ```python
248:     # Simplified from backends/base.py (inside BaseKeyValueStoreBackend)
249:     def _store_result(self, task_id, result, state,
250:                       traceback=None, request=None, **kwargs):
251:         # 1. Prepare the metadata dictionary
252:         meta = self._get_result_meta(result=result, state=state,
253:                                      traceback=traceback, request=request)
254:         meta['task_id'] = bytes_to_str(task_id) # Ensure task_id is str
255: 
256:         # (Check if already successfully stored to prevent overwrites - omitted for brevity)
257: 
258:         # 2. Encode the metadata (e.g., to JSON or pickle)
259:         encoded_meta = self.encode(meta)
260: 
261:         # 3. Get the specific key for this task
262:         key = self.get_key_for_task(task_id) # e.g., b'celery-task-meta-<task_id>'
263: 
264:         # 4. Call the specific backend's 'set' method (implemented by RedisBackend etc.)
265:         #    It might also set an expiry time (self.expires)
266:         try:
267:             self._set_with_state(key, encoded_meta, state) # Calls self.set(key, encoded_meta)
268:         except Exception as exc:
269:              # Handle potential storage errors, maybe retry
270:              raise BackendStoreError(...) from exc
271: 
272:         return result # Returns the original (unencoded) result
273:     ```
274:     The `self.set()` method is implemented by the concrete backend (e.g., `RedisBackend.set` uses `redis-py` client's `setex` or `set` command).
275: 
276: *   **Retrieving Result (`BaseBackend.wait_for` or `BaseKeyValueStoreBackend.get_many` in `celery/backends/base.py`):** When you call `AsyncResult.get()`, it often ends up calling `wait_for` or similar methods that poll the backend.
277: 
278:     ```python
279:     # Simplified from backends/base.py (inside SyncBackendMixin)
280:     def wait_for(self, task_id,
281:                  timeout=None, interval=0.5, no_ack=True, on_interval=None):
282:         """Wait for task and return its result meta."""
283:         self._ensure_not_eager() # Check if running in eager mode
284: 
285:         time_elapsed = 0.0
286: 
287:         while True:
288:             # 1. Get metadata from backend (calls self._get_task_meta_for)
289:             meta = self.get_task_meta(task_id)
290: 
291:             # 2. Check if the task is in a final state
292:             if meta['status'] in states.READY_STATES:
293:                 return meta # Return the full metadata dict
294: 
295:             # 3. Call interval callback if provided
296:             if on_interval:
297:                 on_interval()
298: 
299:             # 4. Sleep to avoid busy-waiting
300:             time.sleep(interval)
301:             time_elapsed += interval
302: 
303:             # 5. Check for timeout
304:             if timeout and time_elapsed >= timeout:
305:                 raise TimeoutError('The operation timed out.')
306:     ```
307:     The `self.get_task_meta(task_id)` eventually calls `self._get_task_meta_for(task_id)`, which in `BaseKeyValueStoreBackend` uses `self.get(key)` (e.g., `RedisBackend.get` uses `redis-py` client's `GET` command) and then decodes the result using `self.decode_result`.
308: 
309: ## Conclusion
310: 
311: You've learned about the crucial **Result Backend**:
312: 
313: *   It acts as a **storage place** (like a filing cabinet or database) for task results and states.
314: *   It's configured using the `result_backend` setting in your [Celery App](01_celery_app.md).
315: *   The [Worker](05_worker.md) stores the outcome (success value or failure exception) in the backend after executing a [Task](03_task.md).
316: *   You use the `AsyncResult` object (returned by `.delay()` or `.apply_async()`) and its methods (`.get()`, `.state`, `.ready()`) to query the backend using the task's unique ID.
317: *   Various backend types exist (Redis, Database, RPC, etc.), each with different characteristics.
318: 
319: Result backends allow your application to track the progress and outcome of background work. But what if you want tasks to run automatically at specific times or on a regular schedule, like sending a report every morning? That's where Celery's scheduler comes in.

  8: # Chapter 7: Beat (Scheduler) - Celery's Alarm Clock
  9: 
 10: In the last chapter, [Chapter 6: Result Backend](06_result_backend.md), we learned how to track the status and retrieve the results of our background tasks. This is great when we manually trigger tasks from our application. But what if we want tasks to run automatically, without us needing to press a button every time?
 11: 
 12: Maybe you need to:
 13: *   Send out a newsletter email every Friday morning.
 14: *   Clean up temporary files in your system every night.
 15: *   Check the health of your external services every 5 minutes.
 16: 
 17: How can you make Celery do these things on a regular schedule? Meet **Celery Beat**.
 18: 
 19: ## What Problem Does Beat Solve?
 20: 
 21: Imagine you have a task, say `send_daily_report()`, that needs to run every morning at 8:00 AM. How would you achieve this? You could try setting up a system `cron` job to call a Python script that sends the Celery task, but that adds another layer of complexity.
 22: 
 23: Celery provides its own built-in solution: **Beat**.
 24: 
 25: **Beat is Celery's periodic task scheduler.** Think of it like a dedicated alarm clock or a `cron` job system built specifically for triggering Celery tasks. It's a separate program that you run alongside your workers. Its job is simple:
 26: 
 27: 1.  Read a list of scheduled tasks (e.g., "run `send_daily_report` every day at 8:00 AM").
 28: 2.  Keep track of the time.
 29: 3.  When the time comes for a scheduled task, Beat sends the task message to the [Broker Connection (AMQP)](04_broker_connection__amqp_.md), just as if you had called `.delay()` yourself.
 30: 4.  A regular Celery [Worker](05_worker.md) then picks up the task from the broker and executes it.
 31: 
 32: Beat doesn't run the tasks itself; it just *schedules* them by sending the messages at the right time.
 33: 
 34: ## Key Concepts
 35: 
 36: 1.  **Beat Process:** A separate Celery program you run (like `celery -A your_app beat`). It needs access to your Celery app's configuration.
 37: 2.  **Schedule:** A configuration setting (usually `beat_schedule` in your Celery config) that defines which tasks should run and when. This schedule can use simple intervals (like every 30 seconds) or cron-like patterns (like "every Monday at 9 AM").
 38: 3.  **Schedule Storage:** Beat needs to remember when each task was last run so it knows when it's due again. By default, it saves this information to a local file named `celerybeat-schedule` (using Python's `shelve` module).
 39: 4.  **Ticker:** The heart of Beat. It's an internal loop that wakes up periodically, checks the schedule against the current time, and sends messages for any due tasks.
 40: 
 41: ## How to Use Beat
 42: 
 43: Let's schedule two tasks:
 44: *   Our `add` task from [Chapter 3: Task](03_task.md) to run every 15 seconds.
 45: *   A new (dummy) task `send_report` to run every minute.
 46: 
 47: **1. Define the Schedule in Configuration**
 48: 
 49: The best place to define your schedule is in your configuration, either directly on the `app` object or in a separate `celeryconfig.py` file (see [Chapter 2: Configuration](02_configuration.md)). We'll use a separate file.
 50: 
 51: First, create the new task in your `tasks.py`:
 52: 
 53: ```python
 54: # tasks.py (add this new task)
 55: from celery_app import app
 56: import time
 57: 
 58: @app.task
 59: def add(x, y):
 60:     """A simple task that adds two numbers."""
 61:     print(f"Task 'add' starting with ({x}, {y})")
 62:     time.sleep(2) # Simulate short work
 63:     result = x + y
 64:     print(f"Task 'add' finished with result: {result}")
 65:     return result
 66: 
 67: @app.task
 68: def send_report(name):
 69:     """A task simulating sending a report."""
 70:     print(f"Task 'send_report' starting for report: {name}")
 71:     time.sleep(5) # Simulate longer work
 72:     print(f"Report '{name}' supposedly sent.")
 73:     return f"Report {name} sent."
 74: ```
 75: 
 76: Now, update or create `celeryconfig.py`:
 77: 
 78: ```python
 79: # celeryconfig.py
 80: from datetime import timedelta
 81: from celery.schedules import crontab
 82: 
 83: # Basic Broker/Backend settings (replace with your actual URLs)
 84: broker_url = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
 85: result_backend = 'redis://localhost:6379/1'
 86: timezone = 'UTC' # Or your preferred timezone, e.g., 'America/New_York'
 87: enable_utc = True
 88: 
 89: # List of modules to import when the Celery worker starts.
 90: # Make sure tasks.py is discoverable in your Python path
 91: imports = ('tasks',)
 92: 
 93: # Define the Beat schedule
 94: beat_schedule = {
 95:     # Executes tasks.add every 15 seconds with arguments (16, 16)
 96:     'add-every-15-seconds': {
 97:         'task': 'tasks.add',          # The task name
 98:         'schedule': 15.0,             # Run every 15 seconds (float or timedelta)
 99:         'args': (16, 16),             # Positional arguments for the task
100:     },
101:     # Executes tasks.send_report every minute
102:     'send-report-every-minute': {
103:         'task': 'tasks.send_report',
104:         'schedule': crontab(),        # Use crontab() for "every minute"
105:         'args': ('daily-summary',),   # Argument for the report name
106:         # Example using crontab for more specific timing:
107:         # 'schedule': crontab(hour=8, minute=0, day_of_week='fri'), # Every Friday at 8:00 AM
108:     },
109: }
110: ```
111: 
112: **Explanation:**
113: 
114: *   `from datetime import timedelta`: Used for simple interval schedules.
115: *   `from celery.schedules import crontab`: Used for cron-like scheduling.
116: *   `imports = ('tasks',)`: Ensures the worker and beat know about the tasks defined in `tasks.py`.
117: *   `beat_schedule = {...}`: This dictionary holds all your scheduled tasks.
118:     *   Each key (`'add-every-15-seconds'`, `'send-report-every-minute'`) is a unique name for the schedule entry.
119:     *   Each value is another dictionary describing the schedule:
120:         *   `'task'`: The full name of the task to run (e.g., `'module_name.task_name'`).
121:         *   `'schedule'`: Defines *when* to run.
122:             *   A `float` or `int`: number of seconds between runs.
123:             *   A `timedelta` object: the time interval between runs.
124:             *   A `crontab` object: for complex schedules (minute, hour, day_of_week, etc.). `crontab()` with no arguments means "every minute".
125:         *   `'args'`: A tuple of positional arguments to pass to the task.
126:         *   `'kwargs'`: (Optional) A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to the task.
127:         *   `'options'`: (Optional) A dictionary of execution options like `queue`, `priority`.
128: 
129: **2. Load the Configuration in Your App**
130: 
131: Make sure your `celery_app.py` loads this configuration:
132: 
133: ```python
134: # celery_app.py
135: from celery import Celery
136: 
137: # Create the app instance
138: app = Celery('tasks')
139: 
140: # Load configuration from the 'celeryconfig' module
141: app.config_from_object('celeryconfig')
142: 
143: # Tasks might be defined here, but we put them in tasks.py
144: # which is loaded via the 'imports' setting in celeryconfig.py
145: ```
146: 
147: **3. Run Celery Beat**
148: 
149: Now, open a terminal and run the Beat process. You need to tell it where your app is (`-A celery_app`):
150: 
151: ```bash
152: # In your terminal
153: celery -A celery_app beat --loglevel=info
154: ```
155: 
156: **Explanation:**
157: 
158: *   `celery`: The Celery command-line tool.
159: *   `-A celery_app`: Points to your app instance (in `celery_app.py`).
160: *   `beat`: Tells Celery to start the scheduler process.
161: *   `--loglevel=info`: Shows informational messages about what Beat is doing.
162: 
163: You'll see output similar to this:
164: 
165: ```text
166: celery beat v5.x.x is starting.
167: __    -    ... __   -        _
168: LocalTime -> 2023-10-27 11:00:00
169: Configuration ->
170:     . broker -> redis://localhost:6379/0
171:     . loader -> celery.loaders.app.AppLoader
172:     . scheduler -> celery.beat.PersistentScheduler
173:     . db -> celerybeat-schedule
174:     . logfile -> [stderr]@INFO
175:     . maxinterval -> 300.0s (5m0s)
176: celery beat v5.x.x has started.
177: ```
178: 
179: Beat is now running! It will check the schedule and:
180: *   Every 15 seconds, it will send a message to run `tasks.add(16, 16)`.
181: *   Every minute, it will send a message to run `tasks.send_report('daily-summary')`.
182: 
183: **4. Run a Worker (Crucial!)**
184: 
185: Beat only *sends* the task messages. You still need a [Worker](05_worker.md) running to actually *execute* the tasks. Open **another terminal** and start a worker:
186: 
187: ```bash
188: # In a SECOND terminal
189: celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info
190: ```
191: 
192: Now, watch the output in the **worker's terminal**. You should see logs appearing periodically as the worker receives and executes the tasks sent by Beat:
193: 
194: ```text
195: # Output in the WORKER terminal (example)
196: [2023-10-27 11:00:15,000: INFO/MainProcess] Task tasks.add[task-id-1] received
197: Task 'add' starting with (16, 16)
198: Task 'add' finished with result: 32
199: [2023-10-27 11:00:17,050: INFO/MainProcess] Task tasks.add[task-id-1] succeeded in 2.05s: 32
200: 
201: [2023-10-27 11:01:00,000: INFO/MainProcess] Task tasks.send_report[task-id-2] received
202: Task 'send_report' starting for report: daily-summary
203: [2023-10-27 11:01:00,000: INFO/MainProcess] Task tasks.add[task-id-3] received  # Another 'add' task might arrive while 'send_report' runs
204: Task 'add' starting with (16, 16)
205: Task 'add' finished with result: 32
206: [2023-10-27 11:01:02,050: INFO/MainProcess] Task tasks.add[task-id-3] succeeded in 2.05s: 32
207: Report 'daily-summary' supposedly sent.
208: [2023-10-27 11:01:05,100: INFO/MainProcess] Task tasks.send_report[task-id-2] succeeded in 5.10s: "Report daily-summary sent."
209: ... and so on ...
210: ```
211: 
212: You have successfully set up scheduled tasks!
213: 
214: ## How It Works Internally (Simplified)
215: 
216: 1.  **Startup:** You run `celery -A celery_app beat`. The Beat process starts.
217: 2.  **Load Config:** It loads the Celery app (`celery_app`) and reads its configuration, paying special attention to `beat_schedule`.
218: 3.  **Load State:** It opens the schedule file (e.g., `celerybeat-schedule`) to see when each task was last run. If the file doesn't exist, it creates it.
219: 4.  **Main Loop (Tick):** Beat enters its main loop (the "ticker").
220: 5.  **Calculate Due Tasks:** In each tick, Beat looks at every entry in `beat_schedule`. For each entry, it compares the current time with the task's `schedule` definition and its `last_run_at` time (from the schedule file). It calculates which tasks are due to run *right now*.
221: 6.  **Send Task Message:** If a task (e.g., `add-every-15-seconds`) is due, Beat constructs a task message (containing `'tasks.add'`, `args=(16, 16)`, etc.) just like `.delay()` would. It sends this message to the configured **Broker**.
222: 7.  **Update State:** Beat updates the `last_run_at` time for the task it just sent in its internal state and saves this back to the schedule file.
223: 8.  **Sleep:** Beat calculates the time until the *next* scheduled task is due and sleeps for that duration (or up to a maximum interval, `beat_max_loop_interval`, usually 5 minutes, whichever is shorter).
224: 9.  **Repeat:** Go back to step 5.
225: 
226: Meanwhile, a **Worker** process is connected to the same **Broker**, picks up the task messages sent by Beat, and executes them.

259: 
260: ## Code Dive: Where Beat Lives
261: 
262: *   **Command Line (`celery/bin/beat.py`):** Handles the `celery beat` command, parses arguments (`-A`, `-s`, `-S`, `--loglevel`), and creates/runs the `Beat` service object.
263: *   **Beat Service Runner (`celery/apps/beat.py`):** The `Beat` class sets up the environment, loads the app, initializes logging, creates the actual scheduler service (`celery.beat.Service`), installs signal handlers, and starts the service.
264: *   **Beat Service (`celery/beat.py:Service`):** This class manages the lifecycle of the scheduler. Its `start()` method contains the main loop that repeatedly calls `scheduler.tick()`. It loads the scheduler class specified in the configuration (defaulting to `PersistentScheduler`).
265: *   **Scheduler (`celery/beat.py:Scheduler` / `PersistentScheduler`):** This is the core logic.
266:     *   `Scheduler` is the base class. Its `tick()` method calculates the time until the next event, finds due tasks, calls `apply_entry` for due tasks, and returns the sleep interval.
267:     *   `PersistentScheduler` inherits from `Scheduler` and adds the logic to load/save the schedule state (last run times) using `shelve` (the `celerybeat-schedule` file). It overrides methods like `setup_schedule`, `sync`, `close`, and `schedule` property to interact with the `shelve` store (`self._store`).
268: *   **Schedule Types (`celery/schedules.py`):** Defines classes like `schedule` (for `timedelta` intervals) and `crontab`. These classes implement the `is_due(last_run_at)` method, which the `Scheduler.tick()` method uses to determine if a task entry should run.
269: 
270: A simplified conceptual look at the `beat_schedule` config structure:
271: 
272: ```python
273: # Example structure from celeryconfig.py
274: 
275: beat_schedule = {
276:     'schedule-name-1': {              # Unique name for this entry
277:         'task': 'my_app.tasks.task1',  # Task to run (module.task_name)
278:         'schedule': 30.0,             # When to run (e.g., seconds, timedelta, crontab)
279:         'args': (arg1, arg2),         # Optional: Positional arguments
280:         'kwargs': {'key': 'value'},   # Optional: Keyword arguments
281:         'options': {'queue': 'hipri'},# Optional: Execution options
282:     },
283:     'schedule-name-2': {
284:         'task': 'my_app.tasks.task2',
285:         'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour=0), # e.g., Run at midnight
286:         # ... other options ...
287:     },
288: }
289: ```
290: 
291: And a very simplified concept of the `Scheduler.tick()` method:
292: 
293: ```python
294: # Simplified conceptual logic of Scheduler.tick()
295: 
296: def tick(self):
297:     remaining_times = []

313: 
314:     # 4. Calculate minimum sleep time until next event
315:     return min(remaining_times + [self.max_interval])

318: ## Conclusion
319: 
320: Celery Beat is your tool for automating task execution within the Celery ecosystem.
321: 
322: *   It acts as a **scheduler**, like an alarm clock or `cron` for Celery tasks.
323: *   It runs as a **separate process** (`celery beat`).
324: *   You define the schedule using the `beat_schedule` setting in your configuration, specifying **what** tasks run, **when** (using intervals or crontabs), and with what **arguments**.
325: *   Beat **sends task messages** to the broker at the scheduled times.
326: *   Running **Workers** are still required to pick up and execute these tasks.
327: 
328: Beat allows you to reliably automate recurring background jobs, from simple periodic checks to complex, time-specific operations.
329: 
330: Now that we know how to run individual tasks, get their results, and schedule them automatically, what if we want to create more complex workflows involving multiple tasks that depend on each other? That's where Celery's Canvas comes in.

  8: # Chapter 8: Canvas (Signatures & Primitives) - Building Task Workflows
  9: 
 10: In the previous chapter, [Chapter 7: Beat (Scheduler)](07_beat__scheduler_.md), we learned how to schedule tasks to run automatically at specific times using Celery Beat. This is great for recurring jobs. But what if you need to run a sequence of tasks, where one task depends on the result of another? Or run multiple tasks in parallel and then collect their results?
 11: 
 12: Imagine you're building a feature where a user uploads an article, and you need to:
 13: 1.  Fetch the article content from a URL.
 14: 2.  Process the text to extract keywords.
 15: 3.  Process the text to detect the language.
 16: 4.  Once *both* processing steps are done, save the article and the extracted metadata to your database.
 17: 
 18: Simply running these tasks independently won't work. Keyword extraction and language detection can happen at the same time, but only *after* the content is fetched. Saving can only happen *after* both processing steps are complete. How do you orchestrate this multi-step workflow?
 19: 
 20: This is where **Celery Canvas** comes in. It provides the building blocks to design complex task workflows.
 21: 
 22: ## What Problem Does Canvas Solve?
 23: 
 24: Canvas helps you connect individual [Task](03_task.md)s together to form more sophisticated processes. It solves the problem of defining dependencies and flow control between tasks. Instead of just firing off tasks one by one and hoping they complete in the right order or manually checking results, Canvas lets you declare the desired workflow structure directly.
 25: 
 26: Think of it like having different types of Lego bricks:
 27: *   Some bricks represent a single task.
 28: *   Other bricks let you connect tasks end-to-end (run in sequence).
 29: *   Some let you stack bricks side-by-side (run in parallel).
 30: *   Others let you build a structure where several parallel steps must finish before the next piece is added.
 31: 
 32: Canvas gives you these connecting bricks for your Celery tasks.
 33: 
 34: ## Key Concepts: Signatures and Primitives
 35: 
 36: The core ideas in Canvas are **Signatures** and **Workflow Primitives**.
 37: 
 38: 1.  **Signature (`signature` or `.s()`): The Basic Building Block**
 39:     *   A `Signature` wraps up everything needed to call a single task: the task's name, the arguments (`args`), the keyword arguments (`kwargs`), and any execution options (like `countdown`, `eta`, queue name).
 40:     *   Think of it as a **pre-filled request form** or a **recipe card** for a specific task execution. It doesn't *run* the task immediately; it just holds the plan for running it.
 41:     *   The easiest way to create a signature is using the `.s()` shortcut on a task function.
 42: 
 43:     ```python
 44:     # tasks.py
 45:     from celery_app import app # Assuming app is defined in celery_app.py
 46: 
 47:     @app.task
 48:     def add(x, y):
 49:         return x + y
 50: 
 51:     # Create a signature for add(2, 3)
 52:     add_sig = add.s(2, 3)
 53: 
 54:     # add_sig now holds the 'plan' to run add(2, 3)
 55:     print(f"Signature: {add_sig}")
 56:     print(f"Task name: {add_sig.task}")
 57:     print(f"Arguments: {add_sig.args}")
 58: 
 59:     # To actually run it, you call .delay() or .apply_async() ON the signature
 60:     # result_promise = add_sig.delay()
 61:     ```
 62: 
 63:     **Output:**
 64:     ```text
 65:     Signature: tasks.add(2, 3)
 66:     Task name: tasks.add
 67:     Arguments: (2, 3)
 68:     ```
 69: 
 70: 2.  **Primitives: Connecting the Blocks**
 71:     Canvas provides several functions (primitives) to combine signatures into workflows:
 72: 
 73:     *   **`chain`:** Links tasks sequentially. The result of the first task is passed as the first argument to the second task, and so on.
 74:         *   Analogy: An assembly line where each station passes its output to the next.
 75:         *   Syntax: `(sig1 | sig2 | sig3)` or `chain(sig1, sig2, sig3)`
 76: 
 77:     *   **`group`:** Runs a list of tasks in parallel. It returns a special result object that helps track the group.
 78:         *   Analogy: Hiring several workers to do similar jobs independently at the same time.
 79:         *   Syntax: `group(sig1, sig2, sig3)`
 80: 
 81:     *   **`chord`:** Runs a group of tasks in parallel (the "header"), and *then*, once *all* tasks in the group have finished successfully, it runs a single callback task (the "body") with the results of the header tasks.
 82:         *   Analogy: A team of researchers works on different parts of a project in parallel. Once everyone is done, a lead researcher collects all the findings to write the final report.
 83:         *   Syntax: `chord(group(header_sigs), body_sig)`
 84: 
 85: There are other primitives like `chunks`, `xmap`, and `starmap`, but `chain`, `group`, and `chord` are the most fundamental ones for building workflows.
 86: 
 87: ## How to Use Canvas: Building the Article Processing Workflow
 88: 
 89: Let's build the workflow we described earlier: Fetch -> (Process Keywords & Detect Language in parallel) -> Save.
 90: 
 91: **1. Define the Tasks**
 92: 
 93: First, we need our basic tasks. Let's create dummy versions in `tasks.py`:
 94: 
 95: ```python
 96: # tasks.py
 97: from celery_app import app
 98: import time
 99: import random
100: 
101: @app.task
102: def fetch_data(url):
103:     print(f"Fetching data from {url}...")
104:     time.sleep(1)
105:     # Simulate fetching some data
106:     data = f"Content from {url} - {random.randint(1, 100)}"
107:     print(f"Fetched: {data}")
108:     return data
109: 
110: @app.task
111: def process_part_a(data):
112:     print(f"Processing Part A for: {data}")
113:     time.sleep(2)
114:     result_a = f"Keywords for '{data}'"
115:     print("Part A finished.")
116:     return result_a
117: 
118: @app.task
119: def process_part_b(data):
120:     print(f"Processing Part B for: {data}")
121:     time.sleep(3) # Simulate slightly longer processing
122:     result_b = f"Language for '{data}'"
123:     print("Part B finished.")
124:     return result_b
125: 
126: @app.task
127: def combine_results(results):
128:     # 'results' will be a list containing the return values
129:     # of process_part_a and process_part_b
130:     print(f"Combining results: {results}")
131:     time.sleep(1)
132:     final_output = f"Combined: {results[0]} | {results[1]}"
133:     print(f"Final Output: {final_output}")
134:     return final_output
135: ```
136: 
137: **2. Define the Workflow Using Canvas**
138: 
139: Now, in a separate script or Python shell, let's define the workflow using signatures and primitives.
140: 
141: ```python
142: # run_workflow.py
143: from celery import chain, group, chord
144: from tasks import fetch_data, process_part_a, process_part_b, combine_results
145: 
146: # The URL we want to process
147: article_url = "http://example.com/article1"
148: 
149: # Create the workflow structure
150: # 1. Fetch data. The result (data) is passed to the next step.
151: # 2. The next step is a chord:
152: #    - Header: A group running process_part_a and process_part_b in parallel.
153: #              Both tasks receive the 'data' from fetch_data.
154: #    - Body: combine_results receives a list of results from the group.
155: 
156: workflow = chain(
157:     fetch_data.s(article_url),              # Step 1: Fetch
158:     chord(                                  # Step 2: Chord
159:         group(process_part_a.s(), process_part_b.s()), # Header: Parallel processing
160:         combine_results.s()                            # Body: Combine results
161:     )
162: )
163: 
164: print(f"Workflow definition:\n{workflow}")
165: 
166: # Start the workflow
167: print("\nSending workflow to Celery...")
168: result_promise = workflow.apply_async()
169: 
170: print(f"Workflow sent! Final result ID: {result_promise.id}")
171: print("Run a Celery worker to execute the tasks.")
172: # You can optionally wait for the final result:
173: # final_result = result_promise.get()
174: # print(f"\nWorkflow finished! Final result: {final_result}")
175: ```
176: 
177: **Explanation:**
178: 
179: *   We import `chain`, `group`, `chord` from `celery`.
180: *   We import our task functions.
181: *   `fetch_data.s(article_url)`: Creates a signature for the first step.
182: *   `process_part_a.s()` and `process_part_b.s()`: Create signatures for the parallel tasks. Note that we *don't* provide the `data` argument here. `chain` automatically passes the result of `fetch_data` to the *next* task in the sequence. Since the next task is a `chord` containing a `group`, Celery cleverly passes the `data` to *each* task within that group.
183: *   `combine_results.s()`: Creates the signature for the final step (the chord's body). It doesn't need arguments initially because the `chord` will automatically pass the list of results from the header group to it.
184: *   `chain(...)`: Connects `fetch_data` to the `chord`.
185: *   `chord(group(...), ...)`: Defines that the group must finish before `combine_results` is called.
186: *   `group(...)`: Defines that `process_part_a` and `process_part_b` run in parallel.
187: *   `workflow.apply_async()`: This sends the *first* task (`fetch_data`) to the broker. The rest of the workflow is encoded in the task's options (like `link` or `chord` information) so that Celery knows what to do next after each step completes.
188: 
189: If you run this script (and have a [Worker](05_worker.md) running), you'll see the tasks execute in the worker logs, respecting the defined dependencies and parallelism. `fetch_data` runs first, then `process_part_a` and `process_part_b` run concurrently, and finally `combine_results` runs after both A and B are done.
190: 
191: ## How It Works Internally (Simplified Walkthrough)
192: 
193: Let's trace a simpler workflow: `my_chain = (add.s(2, 2) | add.s(4))`
194: 
195: 1.  **Workflow Definition:** When you create `my_chain`, Celery creates a `chain` object containing the signatures `add.s(2, 2)` and `add.s(4)`.
196: 2.  **Sending (`my_chain.apply_async()`):**
197:     *   Celery looks at the first task in the chain: `add.s(2, 2)`.
198:     *   It prepares to send this task message to the [Broker Connection (AMQP)](04_broker_connection__amqp_.md).
199:     *   Crucially, it adds a special option to the message, often called `link` (or uses the `chain` field in newer protocols). This option contains the *signature* of the next task in the chain: `add.s(4)`.
200:     *   The message for `add(2, 2)` (with the link to `add(4)`) is sent to the broker.
201: 3.  **Worker 1 Executes First Task:**
202:     *   A [Worker](05_worker.md) picks up the message for `add(2, 2)`.
203:     *   It runs the `add` function with arguments `(2, 2)`. The result is `4`.
204:     *   The worker stores the result `4` in the [Result Backend](06_result_backend.md) (if configured).
205:     *   The worker notices the `link` option in the original message, pointing to `add.s(4)`.
206: 4.  **Worker 1 Sends Second Task:**
207:     *   The worker takes the result of the first task (`4`).
208:     *   It uses the linked signature `add.s(4)`.
209:     *   It *prepends* the result (`4`) to the arguments of the linked signature, making it effectively `add.s(4, 4)`. *(Note: The original `4` in `add.s(4)` came from the chain definition, the first `4` is the result)*.
210:     *   It sends a *new* message to the broker for `add(4, 4)`.
211: 5.  **Worker 2 Executes Second Task:**
212:     *   Another (or the same) worker picks up the message for `add(4, 4)`.
213:     *   It runs `add(4, 4)`. The result is `8`.
214:     *   It stores the result `8` in the backend.
215:     *   There are no more links, so the chain is complete.
216: 
217: `group` works by sending all task messages in the group concurrently. `chord` is more complex; it involves the workers coordinating via the [Result Backend](06_result_backend.md) to count completed tasks in the header before the callback task is finally sent.

247: ```
248: 
249: ## Code Dive: Canvas Implementation
250: 
251: The logic for signatures and primitives resides primarily in `celery/canvas.py`.
252: 
253: *   **`Signature` Class:**
254:     *   Defined in `celery/canvas.py`. It's essentially a dictionary subclass holding `task`, `args`, `kwargs`, `options`, etc.
255:     *   The `.s()` method on a `Task` instance (in `celery/app/task.py`) is a shortcut to create a `Signature`.
256:     *   `apply_async`: Prepares arguments/options by calling `_merge` and then delegates to `self.type.apply_async` (the task's method) or `app.send_task`.
257:     *   `link`, `link_error`: Methods that modify the `options` dictionary to add callbacks.
258:     *   `__or__`: The pipe operator (`|`) overload. It checks the type of the right-hand operand (`other`) and constructs a `_chain` object accordingly.
259: 
260:     ```python
261:     # Simplified from celery/canvas.py
262:     class Signature(dict):
263:         # ... methods like __init__, clone, set, apply_async ...
264: 
265:         def link(self, callback):
266:             # Appends callback signature to the 'link' list in options
267:             return self.append_to_list_option('link', callback)
268: 
269:         def link_error(self, errback):
270:             # Appends errback signature to the 'link_error' list in options
271:             return self.append_to_list_option('link_error', errback)
272: 
273:         def __or__(self, other):
274:             # Called when you use the pipe '|' operator
275:             if isinstance(other, Signature):
276:                 # task | task -> chain
277:                 return _chain(self, other, app=self._app)
278:             # ... other cases for group, chain ...
279:             return NotImplemented
280:     ```
281: 
282: *   **`_chain` Class:**
283:     *   Also in `celery/canvas.py`, inherits from `Signature`. Its `task` name is hardcoded to `'celery.chain'`. The actual task signatures are stored in `kwargs['tasks']`.
284:     *   `apply_async` / `run`: Contains the logic to handle sending the first task with the rest of the chain embedded in the options (either via `link` for protocol 1 or the `chain` message property for protocol 2).
285:     *   `prepare_steps`: This complex method recursively unwraps nested primitives (like a chain within a chain, or a group that needs to become a chord) and sets up the linking between steps.
286: 
287:     ```python
288:     # Simplified concept from celery/canvas.py (chain execution)
289:     class _chain(Signature):
290:         # ... __init__, __or__ ...
291: 
292:         def apply_async(self, args=None, kwargs=None, **options):
293:             # ... handle always_eager ...
294:             return self.run(args, kwargs, app=self.app, **options)
295: 
296:         def run(self, args=None, kwargs=None, app=None, **options):
297:             # ... setup ...
298:             tasks, results = self.prepare_steps(...) # Unroll and freeze tasks
299: 
300:             if results: # If there are tasks to run
301:                 first_task = tasks.pop() # Get the first task (list is reversed)
302:                 remaining_chain = tasks if tasks else None
303: 
304:                 # Determine how to pass the chain info (link vs. message field)
305:                 use_link = self._use_link # ... logic to decide ...
306: 
307:                 if use_link:
308:                     # Protocol 1: Link first task to the second task
309:                     if remaining_chain:
310:                          first_task.link(remaining_chain.pop())
311:                          # (Worker handles subsequent links)
312:                     options_to_apply = options # Pass original options
313:                 else:
314:                     # Protocol 2: Embed the rest of the reversed chain in options
315:                     options_to_apply = ChainMap({'chain': remaining_chain}, options)
316: 
317:                 # Send the *first* task only
318:                 result_from_apply = first_task.apply_async(**options_to_apply)
319:                 # Return AsyncResult of the *last* task in the original chain
320:                 return results[0]
321:     ```
322: 
323: *   **`group` Class:**
324:     *   In `celery/canvas.py`. Its `task` name is `'celery.group'`.
325:     *   `apply_async`: Iterates through its `tasks`, freezes each one (assigning a common `group_id`), sends their messages, and collects the `AsyncResult` objects into a `GroupResult`. It uses a `barrier` (from the `vine` library) to track completion.
326: *   **`chord` Class:**
327:     *   In `celery/canvas.py`. Its `task` name is `'celery.chord'`.
328:     *   `apply_async` / `run`: Coordinates with the result backend (`backend.apply_chord`). It typically runs the header `group` first, configuring it to notify the backend upon completion. The backend then triggers the `body` task once the count is reached.
329: 
330: ## Conclusion
331: 
332: Celery Canvas transforms simple tasks into powerful workflow components.
333: 
334: *   A **Signature** (`task.s()`) captures the details for a single task call without running it.
335: *   Primitives like **`chain`** (`|`), **`group`**, and **`chord`** combine signatures to define complex execution flows:
336:     *   `chain`: Sequence (output of one to input of next).
337:     *   `group`: Parallel execution.
338:     *   `chord`: Parallel execution followed by a callback with all results.
339: *   You compose these primitives like building with Lego bricks to model your application's logic.
340: *   Calling `.apply_async()` on a workflow primitive starts the process by sending the first task(s), embedding the rest of the workflow logic in the task options or using backend coordination.
341: 
342: Canvas allows you to move complex orchestration logic out of your application code and into Celery, making your tasks more modular and your overall system more robust.
343: 
344: Now that you can build and run complex workflows, how do you monitor what's happening inside Celery? How do you know when tasks start, finish, or fail in real-time?

  8: # Chapter 9: Events - Listening to Celery's Heartbeat
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 8: Canvas (Signatures & Primitives)](08_canvas__signatures___primitives_.md), we saw how to build complex workflows by chaining tasks together or running them in parallel. But as your Celery system gets busier, you might wonder: "What are my workers doing *right now*? Which tasks have started? Which ones finished successfully or failed?"
 11: 
 12: Imagine you're running an important data processing job involving many tasks. Wouldn't it be great to have a live dashboard showing the progress, or get immediate notifications if something goes wrong? This is where **Celery Events** come in.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Do Events Solve?
 15: 
 16: Celery Events provide a **real-time monitoring system** for your tasks and workers. Think of it like a live activity log or a notification system built into Celery.
 17: 
 18: Without events, finding out what happened requires checking logs or querying the [Result Backend](06_result_backend.md) for each task individually. This isn't ideal for getting a live overview of the entire cluster.
 19: 
 20: Events solve this by having workers broadcast messages (events) about important actions they take, such as:
 21: *   A worker coming online or going offline.
 22: *   A worker receiving a task.
 23: *   A worker starting to execute a task.
 24: *   A task succeeding or failing.
 25: *   A worker sending out a heartbeat signal.
 26: 
 27: Other programs can then listen to this stream of event messages to monitor the health and activity of the Celery cluster in real-time, build dashboards (like the popular tool Flower), or trigger custom alerts.
 28: 
 29: ## Key Concepts
 30: 
 31: 1.  **Events:** Special messages sent by workers (and sometimes clients) describing an action. Each event has a `type` (e.g., `task-received`, `worker-online`) and contains details relevant to that action (like the task ID, worker hostname, timestamp).
 32: 2.  **Event Exchange:** Events aren't sent to the regular task queues. They are published to a dedicated, named exchange on the [Broker Connection (AMQP)](04_broker_connection__amqp_.md). Think of it as a separate broadcast channel just for monitoring messages.
 33: 3.  **Event Sender (`EventDispatcher`):** A component within the [Worker](05_worker.md) responsible for creating and sending event messages to the broker's event exchange. This is usually disabled by default for performance reasons.
 34: 4.  **Event Listener (`EventReceiver`):** Any program that connects to the event exchange on the broker and consumes the stream of event messages. This could be the `celery events` command-line tool, Flower, or your own custom monitoring script.
 35: 5.  **Event Types:** Celery defines many event types. Some common ones include:
 36:     *   `worker-online`, `worker-offline`, `worker-heartbeat`: Worker status updates.
 37:     *   `task-sent`: Client sent a task request (requires `task_send_sent_event` setting).
 38:     *   `task-received`: Worker received the task message.
 39:     *   `task-started`: Worker started executing the task code.
 40:     *   `task-succeeded`: Task finished successfully.
 41:     *   `task-failed`: Task failed with an error.
 42:     *   `task-retried`: Task is being retried.
 43:     *   `task-revoked`: Task was cancelled/revoked.
 44: 
 45: ## How to Use Events: Simple Monitoring
 46: 
 47: Let's see how to enable events and watch the live stream using Celery's built-in tool.
 48: 
 49: **1. Enable Events in the Worker**
 50: 
 51: By default, workers don't send events to save resources. You need to explicitly tell them to start sending. You can do this in two main ways:
 52: 
 53: *   **Command-line flag (`-E`):** When starting your worker, add the `-E` flag.
 54: 
 55:     ```bash
 56:     # Start a worker AND enable sending events
 57:     celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info -E
 58:     ```
 59: 
 60: *   **Configuration Setting:** Set `worker_send_task_events = True` in your Celery configuration ([Chapter 2: Configuration](02_configuration.md)). This is useful if you always want events enabled for workers using that configuration. You can also enable worker-specific events (`worker-online`, `worker-heartbeat`) with `worker_send_worker_events = True` (which defaults to True).
 61: 
 62:     ```python
 63:     # celeryconfig.py (example)
 64:     broker_url = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
 65:     result_backend = 'redis://localhost:6379/1'
 66:     imports = ('tasks',)
 67: 
 68:     # Enable sending task-related events
 69:     task_send_sent_event = False # Optional: If you want task-sent events too
 70:     worker_send_task_events = True
 71:     worker_send_worker_events = True # Usually True by default
 72:     ```
 73: 
 74: Now, any worker started with this configuration (or the `-E` flag) will publish events to the broker.
 75: 
 76: **2. Watch the Event Stream**
 77: 
 78: Celery provides a command-line tool called `celery events` that acts as a simple event listener and prints the events it receives to your console.
 79: 
 80: Open **another terminal** (while your worker with events enabled is running) and run:
 81: 
 82: ```bash
 83: # Watch for events associated with your app
 84: celery -A celery_app events
 85: ```
 86: 
 87: Alternatively, you can use the more descriptive (but older) command `celery control enable_events` to tell already running workers to start sending events, and `celery control disable_events` to stop them.
 88: 
 89: **What You'll See:**
 90: 
 91: Initially, `celery events` might show nothing. Now, try sending a task from another script or shell (like the `run_tasks.py` from [Chapter 3: Task](03_task.md)):
 92: 
 93: ```python
 94: # In a third terminal/shell
 95: from tasks import add
 96: result = add.delay(5, 10)
 97: print(f"Sent task {result.id}")
 98: ```
 99: 
100: Switch back to the terminal running `celery events`. You should see output similar to this (details and timestamps will vary):
101: 
102: ```text
103: -> celery events v5.x.x
104: -> connected to redis://localhost:6379/0
105:

130:     timestamp:1666872004.2
131:     pid:12345
132:     ...
133: ```
134: 
135: **Explanation:**
136: 
137: *   `celery events` connects to the broker defined in `celery_app`.
138: *   It listens for messages on the event exchange.
139: *   As the worker processes the `add(5, 10)` task, it sends `task-received`, `task-started`, and `task-succeeded` events.
140: *   `celery events` receives these messages and prints their details.
141: 
142: This gives you a raw, real-time feed of what's happening in your Celery cluster!
143: 
144: **Flower: A Visual Monitor**
145: 
146: While `celery events` is useful, it's quite basic. A very popular tool called **Flower** uses the same event stream to provide a web-based dashboard for monitoring your Celery cluster. It shows running tasks, completed tasks, worker status, task details, and more, all updated in real-time thanks to Celery Events. You can typically install it (`pip install flower`) and run it (`celery -A celery_app flower`).
147: 
148: ## How It Works Internally (Simplified)
149: 
150: 1.  **Worker Action:** A worker performs an action (e.g., starts executing task `T1`).
151: 2.  **Event Dispatch:** If events are enabled, the worker's internal `EventDispatcher` component is notified.
152: 3.  **Create Event Message:** The `EventDispatcher` creates a dictionary representing the event (e.g., `{'type': 'task-started', 'uuid': 'T1', 'hostname': 'worker1', ...}`).
153: 4.  **Publish to Broker:** The `EventDispatcher` uses its connection to the [Broker Connection (AMQP)](04_broker_connection__amqp_.md) to publish this event message to a specific **event exchange** (usually named `celeryev`). It uses a routing key based on the event type (e.g., `task.started`).
154: 5.  **Listener Connects:** A monitoring tool (like `celery events` or Flower) starts up. It creates an `EventReceiver`.
155: 6.  **Declare Queue:** The `EventReceiver` connects to the same broker and declares a temporary, unique queue bound to the event exchange (`celeryev`), often configured to receive all event types (`#` routing key).
156: 7.  **Consume Events:** The `EventReceiver` starts consuming messages from its dedicated queue.
157: 8.  **Process Event:** When an event message (like the `task-started` message for `T1`) arrives from the broker, the `EventReceiver` decodes it and passes it to a handler (e.g., `celery events` prints it, Flower updates its web UI).

180: 
181: ## Code Dive: Sending and Receiving Events
182: 
183: *   **Enabling Events (`celery/worker/consumer/events.py`):** The `Events` bootstep in the worker process is responsible for initializing the `EventDispatcher`. The `-E` flag or configuration settings control whether this bootstep actually enables the dispatcher.
184: 
185:     ```python
186:     # Simplified from worker/consumer/events.py
187:     class Events(bootsteps.StartStopStep):
188:         requires = (Connection,)
189: 
190:         def __init__(self, c, task_events=True, # Controlled by config/flags
191:                      # ... other flags ...
192:                      **kwargs):
193:             self.send_events = task_events # or other flags
194:             self.enabled = self.send_events
195:             # ...
196:             super().__init__(c, **kwargs)
197: 
198:         def start(self, c):
199:             # ... gets connection ...
200:             # Creates the actual dispatcher instance
201:             dis = c.event_dispatcher = c.app.events.Dispatcher(
202:                 c.connection_for_write(),
203:                 hostname=c.hostname,
204:                 enabled=self.send_events, # Only sends if enabled
205:                 # ... other options ...
206:             )
207:             # ... flush buffer ...
208:     ```
209: 
210: *   **Sending Events (`celery/events/dispatcher.py`):** The `EventDispatcher` class has the `send` method, which creates the event dictionary and calls `publish`.
211: 
212:     ```python
213:     # Simplified from events/dispatcher.py
214:     class EventDispatcher:
215:         # ... __init__ setup ...
216: 
217:         def send(self, type, blind=False, ..., **fields):
218:             if self.enabled:
219:                 groups, group = self.groups, group_from(type)
220:                 if groups and group not in groups:
221:                      return # Don't send if this group isn't enabled
222: 
223:                 # ... potential buffering logic (omitted) ...
224: 
225:                 # Call publish to actually send
226:                 return self.publish(type, fields, self.producer, blind=blind,
227:                                     Event=Event, ...)
228: 
229:         def publish(self, type, fields, producer, blind=False, Event=Event, **kwargs):
230:             # Create the event dictionary
231:             clock = None if blind else self.clock.forward()
232:             event = Event(type, hostname=self.hostname, utcoffset=utcoffset(),
233:                           pid=self.pid, clock=clock, **fields)
234: 
235:             # Publish using the underlying Kombu producer
236:             with self.mutex:
237:                 return self._publish(event, producer,
238:                                      routing_key=type.replace('-', '.'), **kwargs)
239: 
240:         def _publish(self, event, producer, routing_key, **kwargs):
241:             exchange = self.exchange # The dedicated event exchange
242:             try:
243:                 # Kombu's publish method sends the message
244:                 producer.publish(
245:                     event, # The dictionary payload
246:                     routing_key=routing_key,
247:                     exchange=exchange.name,
248:                     declare=[exchange], # Ensure exchange exists
249:                     serializer=self.serializer, # e.g., 'json'
250:                     headers=self.headers,
251:                     delivery_mode=self.delivery_mode, # e.g., transient
252:                     **kwargs
253:                 )
254:             except Exception as exc:
255:                 # ... error handling / buffering ...
256:                 raise
257:     ```
258: 
259: *   **Receiving Events (`celery/events/receiver.py`):** The `EventReceiver` class (used by tools like `celery events`) sets up a consumer to listen for messages on the event exchange.
260: 
261:     ```python
262:     # Simplified from events/receiver.py
263:     class EventReceiver(ConsumerMixin): # Uses Kombu's ConsumerMixin
264: 
265:         def __init__(self, channel, handlers=None, routing_key='#', ...):
266:             # ... setup app, channel, handlers ...
267:             self.exchange = get_exchange(..., name=self.app.conf.event_exchange)
268:             self.queue = Queue( # Create a unique, auto-deleting queue
269:                 '.'.join([self.queue_prefix, self.node_id]),
270:                 exchange=self.exchange,
271:                 routing_key=routing_key, # Often '#' to get all events
272:                 auto_delete=True, durable=False,
273:                 # ... other queue options ...
274:             )
275:             # ...
276: 
277:         def get_consumers(self, Consumer, channel):
278:             # Tell ConsumerMixin to consume from our event queue
279:             return [Consumer(queues=[self.queue],
280:                              callbacks=[self._receive], # Method to call on message
281:                              no_ack=True, # Events usually don't need explicit ack
282:                              accept=self.accept)]
283: 
284:         # This method is registered as the callback for new messages
285:         def _receive(self, body, message):
286:             # Decode message body (can be single event or list in newer Celery)
287:             if isinstance(body, list):
288:                 process, from_message = self.process, self.event_from_message
289:                 [process(*from_message(event)) for event in body]
290:             else:
291:                 self.process(*self.event_from_message(body))
292: 
293:         # process() calls the appropriate handler from self.handlers
294:         def process(self, type, event):
295:             """Process event by dispatching to configured handler."""
296:             handler = self.handlers.get(type) or self.handlers.get('*')
297:             handler and handler(event) # Call the handler function
298:     ```

300: ## Conclusion
301: 
302: Celery Events provide a powerful mechanism for **real-time monitoring** of your distributed task system.
303: 
304: *   Workers (when enabled via `-E` or configuration) send **event messages** describing their actions (like task start/finish, worker online).
305: *   These messages go to a dedicated **event exchange** on the broker.
306: *   Tools like `celery events` or Flower act as **listeners** (`EventReceiver`), consuming this stream to provide insights into the cluster's activity.
307: *   Events are the foundation for building dashboards, custom monitoring, and diagnostic tools.
308: 
309: Understanding events helps you observe and manage your Celery application more effectively.
310: 
311: So far, we've explored the major components and concepts of Celery. But how does a worker actually start up? How does it initialize all these different parts like the connection, the consumer, the event dispatcher, and the execution pool in the right order? That's orchestrated by a system called Bootsteps.

  8: # Chapter 10: Bootsteps - How Celery Workers Start Up
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 9: Events](09_events.md), we learned how to monitor the real-time activity within our Celery system. We've now covered most of the key parts of Celery: the [Celery App](01_celery_app.md), [Task](03_task.md)s, the [Broker Connection (AMQP)](04_broker_connection__amqp_.md), the [Worker](05_worker.md), the [Result Backend](06_result_backend.md), [Beat (Scheduler)](07_beat__scheduler_.md), [Canvas (Signatures & Primitives)](08_canvas__signatures___primitives_.md), and [Events](09_events.md).
 11: 
 12: But have you ever wondered how the Celery worker manages to get all these different parts working together when you start it? When you run `celery worker`, it needs to connect to the broker, set up the execution pool, start listening for tasks, maybe start the event dispatcher, and possibly even start an embedded Beat scheduler. How does it ensure all these things happen in the correct order? That's where **Bootsteps** come in.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Do Bootsteps Solve?
 15: 
 16: Imagine you're assembling a complex piece of furniture. You have many parts and screws, and the instructions list a specific sequence of steps. You can't attach the tabletop before you've built the legs! Similarly, a Celery worker has many internal components that need to be initialized and started in a precise order.
 17: 
 18: For example, the worker needs to:
 19: 1.  Establish a connection to the [Broker Connection (AMQP)](04_broker_connection__amqp_.md).
 20: 2.  *Then*, start the consumer logic that uses this connection to fetch tasks.
 21: 3.  Set up the execution pool (like prefork or eventlet) that will actually run the tasks.
 22: 4.  Start optional components like the [Events](09_events.md) dispatcher or the embedded [Beat (Scheduler)](07_beat__scheduler_.md).
 23: 
 24: If these steps happen out of order (e.g., trying to fetch tasks before connecting to the broker), the worker will fail.
 25: 
 26: **Bootsteps** provide a framework within Celery to define this startup (and shutdown) sequence. It's like the assembly instructions or a detailed checklist for the worker. Each major component or initialization phase is defined as a "step," and steps can declare dependencies on each other (e.g., "Step B requires Step A to be finished"). Celery uses this information to automatically figure out the correct order to start everything up and, just as importantly, the correct reverse order to shut everything down cleanly.
 27: 
 28: This makes the worker's internal structure more organized, modular, and easier for Celery developers to extend with new features. As a user, you generally don't write bootsteps yourself, but understanding the concept helps demystify the worker's startup process.
 29: 
 30: ## Key Concepts
 31: 
 32: 1.  **Step (`Step`):** A single, distinct part of the worker's startup or shutdown logic. Think of it as one instruction in the assembly manual. Examples include initializing the broker connection, starting the execution pool, or starting the component that listens for task messages (the consumer).
 33: 2.  **Blueprint (`Blueprint`):** A collection of related steps that manage a larger component. For instance, the main "Consumer" component within the worker has its own blueprint defining steps for connection, event handling, task fetching, etc.
 34: 3.  **Dependencies (`requires`):** A step can declare that it needs other steps to be completed first. For example, the step that starts fetching tasks (`Tasks`) *requires* the step that establishes the broker connection (`Connection`).
 35: 4.  **Order:** Celery analyzes the `requires` declarations of all steps within a blueprint (and potentially across blueprints) to build a dependency graph. It then sorts this graph to determine the exact order in which steps must be started. Shutdown usually happens in the reverse order.
 36: 
 37: ## How It Works: The Worker Startup Sequence
 38: 
 39: You don't typically interact with bootsteps directly, but you see their effect every time you start a worker.
 40: 
 41: When you run:
 42: `celery -A your_app worker --loglevel=info`
 43: 
 44: Celery initiates the **Worker Controller** (`WorkController`). This controller uses the Bootstep framework, specifically a main **Blueprint**, to manage its initialization.
 45: 
 46: Here's a simplified idea of what happens under the hood, orchestrated by Bootsteps:
 47: 
 48: 1.  **Load Blueprint:** The `WorkController` loads its main blueprint, which includes steps for core functionalities.
 49: 2.  **Build Graph:** Celery looks at all the steps defined in the blueprint (e.g., `Connection`, `Pool`, `Consumer`, `Timer`, `Events`, potentially `Beat`) and their `requires` attributes. It builds a dependency graph.
 50: 3.  **Determine Order:** It calculates the correct startup order from the graph (a "topological sort"). For example, it determines that `Connection` must start before `Consumer`, and `Pool` must start before `Consumer` can start dispatching tasks to it.
 51: 4.  **Execute Steps:** The `WorkController` iterates through the steps in the determined order and calls each step's `start` method.
 52:     *   The `Connection` step establishes the link to the broker.
 53:     *   The `Timer` step sets up internal timers.
 54:     *   The `Pool` step initializes the execution pool (e.g., starts prefork child processes).
 55:     *   The `Events` step starts the event dispatcher (if `-E` was used).
 56:     *   The `Consumer` step (usually last) starts the main loop that fetches tasks from the broker and dispatches them to the pool.
 57: 5.  **Worker Ready:** Once all essential bootsteps have successfully started, the worker prints the "ready" message and begins processing tasks.
 58: 
 59: When you stop the worker (e.g., with Ctrl+C), a similar process happens in reverse using the steps' `stop` or `terminate` methods, ensuring connections are closed, pools are shut down, etc., in the correct order.

 61: ## Internal Implementation Walkthrough

 87:     WorkerMain->>WorkerMain: Worker is Ready
 88: ```
 89: 
 90: The Bootstep framework relies on classes defined mainly in `celery/bootsteps.py`.
 91: 
 92: ## Code Dive: Anatomy of a Bootstep
 93: 
 94: Bootsteps are defined as classes inheriting from `Step` or `StartStopStep`.
 95: 
 96: *   **Defining a Step:** A step class defines its logic and dependencies.
 97: 
 98:     ```python
 99:     # Simplified concept from celery/bootsteps.py
100: 
101:     # Base class for all steps
102:     class Step:
103:         # List of other Step classes needed before this one runs
104:         requires = ()
105: 
106:         def __init__(self, parent, **kwargs):
107:             # Called when the blueprint is applied to the parent (e.g., Worker)
108:             # Can be used to set initial attributes on the parent.
109:             pass
110: 
111:         def create(self, parent):
112:             # Create the service/component managed by this step.
113:             # Often returns an object to be stored.
114:             pass
115: 
116:         def include(self, parent):
117:             # Logic to add this step to the parent's step list.
118:             # Called after __init__.
119:             if self.should_include(parent):
120:                  self.obj = self.create(parent) # Store created object if needed
121:                  parent.steps.append(self)
122:                  return True
123:             return False
124: 
125:     # A common step type with start/stop/terminate methods
126:     class StartStopStep(Step):
127:         obj = None # Holds the object created by self.create
128: 
129:         def start(self, parent):
130:             # Logic to start the component/service
131:             if self.obj and hasattr(self.obj, 'start'):
132:                 self.obj.start()
133: 
134:         def stop(self, parent):
135:             # Logic to stop the component/service gracefully
136:             if self.obj and hasattr(self.obj, 'stop'):
137:                 self.obj.stop()
138: 
139:         def terminate(self, parent):
140:             # Logic to force shutdown (if different from stop)
141:             if self.obj:
142:                 term_func = getattr(self.obj, 'terminate', None) or getattr(self.obj, 'stop', None)
143:                 if term_func:
144:                     term_func()
145: 
146:         # include() method adds self to parent.steps if created
147:     ```
148:     **Explanation:**
149:     *   `requires`: A tuple of other Step classes that must be fully started *before* this step's `start` method is called. This defines the dependencies.
150:     *   `__init__`, `create`, `include`: Methods involved in setting up the step and potentially creating the component it manages.
151:     *   `start`, `stop`, `terminate`: Methods called during the worker's lifecycle (startup, graceful shutdown, forced shutdown).
152: 
153: *   **Blueprint:** Manages a collection of steps.
154: 
155:     ```python
156:     # Simplified concept from celery/bootsteps.py
157:     from celery.utils.graph import DependencyGraph
158: 
159:     class Blueprint:
160:         # Set of default step classes (or string names) included in this blueprint
161:         default_steps = set()
162: 
163:         def __init__(self, steps=None, name=None, **kwargs):
164:             self.name = name or self.__class__.__name__
165:             # Combine default steps with any provided steps
166:             self.types = set(steps or []) | set(self.default_steps)
167:             self.steps = {} # Will hold step instances
168:             self.order = [] # Will hold sorted step instances
169:             # ... other callbacks ...
170: 
171:         def apply(self, parent, **kwargs):
172:             # 1. Load step classes from self.types
173:             step_classes = self.claim_steps() # {name: StepClass, ...}
174: 
175:             # 2. Build the dependency graph
176:             self.graph = DependencyGraph(
177:                 ((Cls, Cls.requires) for Cls in step_classes.values()),
178:                 # ... formatter options ...
179:             )
180: 
181:             # 3. Get the topologically sorted order
182:             sorted_classes = self.graph.topsort()
183: 
184:             # 4. Instantiate and include each step
185:             self.order = []
186:             for S in sorted_classes:
187:                 step = S(parent, **kwargs) # Call Step.__init__
188:                 self.steps[step.name] = step
189:                 self.order.append(step)
190:             for step in self.order:
191:                 step.include(parent) # Call Step.include -> Step.create
192: 
193:             return self
194: 
195:         def start(self, parent):
196:             # Called by the parent (e.g., Worker) to start all steps
197:             for step in self.order: # Use the sorted order
198:                 if hasattr(step, 'start'):
199:                     step.start(parent)
200: 
201:         def stop(self, parent):
202:             # Called by the parent to stop all steps (in reverse order)
203:             for step in reversed(self.order):
204:                  if hasattr(step, 'stop'):
205:                     step.stop(parent)
206:         # ... other methods like close, terminate, restart ...
207:     ```
208:     **Explanation:**
209:     *   `default_steps`: Defines the standard components managed by this blueprint.
210:     *   `apply`: The core method that takes the step definitions, builds the `DependencyGraph` based on `requires`, gets the sorted execution `order`, and then instantiates and includes each step.
211:     *   `start`/`stop`: Iterate through the calculated `order` (or its reverse) to start/stop the components managed by each step.
212: 
213: *   **Example Usage (Worker Components):** The worker's main components are defined as bootsteps in `celery/worker/components.py`. You can see classes like `Pool`, `Consumer`, `Timer`, `Beat`, each inheriting from `bootsteps.Step` or `bootsteps.StartStopStep` and potentially defining `requires`. The `Consumer` blueprint in `celery/worker/consumer/consumer.py` then lists many of these (`Connection`, `Events`, `Tasks`, etc.) in its `default_steps`.
214: 
215: ## Conclusion
216: 
217: You've learned about Bootsteps, the underlying framework that brings order to the Celery worker's startup and shutdown procedures.
218: 
219: *   They act as an **assembly guide** or **checklist** for the worker.
220: *   Each core function (connecting, starting pool, consuming tasks) is a **Step**.
221: *   Steps declare **Dependencies** (`requires`) on each other.
222: *   A **Blueprint** groups related steps.
223: *   Celery uses a **Dependency Graph** to determine the correct **order** to start and stop steps.
224: *   This ensures components like the [Broker Connection (AMQP)](04_broker_connection__amqp_.md), [Worker](05_worker.md) pool, and task consumer initialize and terminate predictably.
225: 
226: While you typically don't write bootsteps as an end-user, understanding their role clarifies how the complex machinery of a Celery worker reliably comes to life and shuts down.
227: 
228: ---
229: 
230: This concludes our introductory tour of Celery's core concepts! We hope these chapters have given you a solid foundation for understanding how Celery works and how you can use it to build robust and scalable distributed applications. Happy tasking!

12: Celery<sup>[View Repo](https://github.com/celery/celery/tree/d1c35bbdf014f13f4ab698d75e3ea381a017b090/celery)</sup> is a system for running **distributed tasks** *asynchronously*. You define *units of work* (Tasks) in your Python code. When you want a task to run, you send a message using a **message broker** (like RabbitMQ or Redis). One or more **Worker** processes are running in the background, listening for these messages. When a worker receives a message, it executes the corresponding task. Optionally, the task's result (or any error) can be stored in a **Result Backend** (like Redis or a database) so you can check its status or retrieve the output later. Celery helps manage this whole process, making it easier to handle background jobs, scheduled tasks, and complex workflows.

  8: # Chapter 1: Commands and Groups: The Building Blocks
  9: 
 10: Welcome to your first step in learning Click! Imagine you want to create your own command-line tool, maybe something like `git` or `docker`. How do you tell your program what to do when someone types `git commit` or `docker build`? That's where **Commands** and **Groups** come in. They are the fundamental building blocks for any Click application.
 11: 
 12: Think about a simple tool. Maybe you want a program that can greet someone. You'd type `greet Alice` in your terminal, and it would print "Hello Alice!". In Click, this single action, "greet", would be represented by a `Command`.
 13: 
 14: Now, what if your tool needed to do *more* than one thing? Maybe besides greeting, it could also say goodbye. You might want to type `mytool greet Alice` or `mytool goodbye Bob`. The main `mytool` part acts like a container or a menu, holding the different actions (`greet`, `goodbye`). This container is what Click calls a `Group`.
 15: 
 16: So:
 17: 
 18: *   `Command`: Represents a single action your tool can perform.
 19: *   `Group`: Represents a collection of related actions (Commands or other Groups).
 20: 
 21: Let's dive in and see how to create them!
 22: 
 23: ## Your First Command
 24: 
 25: Creating a command in Click is surprisingly simple. You basically write a normal Python function and then "decorate" it to tell Click it's a command-line command.
 26: 
 27: Let's make a command that just prints "Hello World!".
 28: 
 29: ```python
 30: # hello_app.py
 31: import click
 32: 
 33: @click.command()
 34: def hello():
 35:   """A simple command that says Hello World"""
 36:   print("Hello World!")
 37: 
 38: if __name__ == '__main__':
 39:   hello()
 40: ```
 41: 
 42: Let's break this down:
 43: 
 44: 1.  `import click`: We need to import the Click library first.
 45: 2.  `@click.command()`: This is the magic part! It's called a decorator. It transforms the Python function `hello()` right below it into a Click `Command` object. We'll learn more about [Decorators](02_decorators.md) in the next chapter, but for now, just know this line turns `hello` into something Click understands as a command.
 46: 3.  `def hello(): ...`: This is a standard Python function. The code inside this function is what will run when you execute the command from your terminal.
 47: 4.  `"""A simple command that says Hello World"""`: This is a docstring. Click cleverly uses the function's docstring as the help text for the command!
 48: 5.  `if __name__ == '__main__': hello()`: This standard Python construct checks if the script is being run directly. If it is, it calls our `hello` command function (which is now actually a Click `Command` object).
 49: 
 50: **Try running it!** Save the code above as `hello_app.py`. Open your terminal in the same directory and run:
 51: 
 52: ```bash
 53: $ python hello_app.py
 54: Hello World!
 55: ```
 56: 
 57: It works! You just created your first command-line command with Click.
 58: 
 59: **Bonus: Automatic Help!**
 60: 
 61: Click automatically generates help screens for you. Try running your command with `--help`:
 62: 
 63: ```bash
 64: $ python hello_app.py --help
 65: Usage: hello_app.py [OPTIONS]
 66: 
 67:   A simple command that says Hello World
 68: 
 69: Options:
 70:   --help  Show this message and exit.
 71: ```
 72: 
 73: See? Click used the docstring we wrote (`A simple command that says Hello World`) and added a standard `--help` option for free!
 74: 
 75: ## Grouping Commands
 76: 
 77: Okay, one command is nice, but real tools often have multiple commands. Like `git` has `commit`, `pull`, `push`, etc. Let's say we want our tool to have two commands: `hello` and `goodbye`.
 78: 
 79: We need a way to group these commands together. That's what `click.group()` is for. A `Group` acts as the main entry point and can have other commands attached to it.
 80: 
 81: ```python
 82: # multi_app.py
 83: import click
 84: 
 85: # 1. Create the main group
 86: @click.group()
 87: def cli():
 88:   """A simple tool with multiple commands."""
 89:   pass # The group function itself doesn't need to do anything
 90: 
 91: # 2. Define the 'hello' command
 92: @click.command()
 93: def hello():
 94:   """Says Hello World"""
 95:   print("Hello World!")
 96: 
 97: # 3. Define the 'goodbye' command
 98: @click.command()
 99: def goodbye():
100:   """Says Goodbye World"""
101:   print("Goodbye World!")
102: 
103: # 4. Attach the commands to the group
104: cli.add_command(hello)
105: cli.add_command(goodbye)
106: 
107: if __name__ == '__main__':
108:   cli() # Run the main group
109: ```
110: 
111: What's changed?
112: 
113: 1.  We created a function `cli` and decorated it with `@click.group()`. This makes `cli` our main entry point, a container for other commands. Notice the function body is just `pass` – often, the group function itself doesn't need logic; its job is to hold other commands.
114: 2.  We defined `hello` and `goodbye` just like before, using `@click.command()`.
115: 3.  Crucially, we *attached* our commands to the group: `cli.add_command(hello)` and `cli.add_command(goodbye)`. This tells Click that `hello` and `goodbye` are subcommands of `cli`.
116: 4.  Finally, in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, we run `cli()`, our main group.
117: 
118: **Let's run this!** Save it as `multi_app.py`.
119: 
120: First, check the main help screen:
121: 
122: ```bash
123: $ python multi_app.py --help
124: Usage: multi_app.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
125: 
126:   A simple tool with multiple commands.
127: 
128: Options:
129:   --help  Show this message and exit.
130: 
131: Commands:
132:   goodbye  Says Goodbye World
133:   hello    Says Hello World
134: ```
135: 
136: Look! Click now lists `goodbye` and `hello` under "Commands". It automatically figured out their names from the function names (`goodbye`, `hello`) and their help text from their docstrings.
137: 
138: Now, run the specific commands:
139: 
140: ```bash
141: $ python multi_app.py hello
142: Hello World!
143: 
144: $ python multi_app.py goodbye
145: Goodbye World!
146: ```
147: 
148: You've successfully created a multi-command CLI tool!
149: 
150: *(Self-promotion: There's an even shorter way to attach commands using decorators directly on the group, which we'll see in [Decorators](02_decorators.md)!)*
151: 
152: ## How It Works Under the Hood
153: 
154: What's really happening when you use `@click.command()` or `@click.group()`?
155: 
156: 1.  **Decoration:** The decorator (`@click.command` or `@click.group`) takes your Python function (`hello`, `goodbye`, `cli`). It wraps this function inside a Click object – either a `Command` instance or a `Group` instance (which is actually a special type of `Command`). These objects store your original function as the `callback` to be executed later. They also store metadata like the command name (derived from the function name) and the help text (from the docstring). You can find the code for these decorators in `decorators.py` and the `Command`/`Group` classes in `core.py`.
157: 
158: 2.  **Execution:** When you run `python multi_app.py hello`, Python executes the `cli()` call at the bottom. Since `cli` is a `Group` object created by Click, it knows how to parse the command-line arguments (`hello` in this case).
159: 
160: 3.  **Parsing & Dispatch:** The `cli` group looks at the first argument (`hello`). It checks its list of registered subcommands (which we added using `cli.add_command`). It finds a match with the `hello` command object.
161: 
162: 4.  **Callback:** The `cli` group then invokes the `hello` command object. The `hello` command object, in turn, calls the original Python function (`hello()`) that it stored earlier as its `callback`.
163: 
164: Here's a simplified view of what happens when you run `python multi_app.py hello`:
165: 
166: ```mermaid
167: sequenceDiagram
168:     participant User
169:     participant Terminal
170:     participant PythonScript (multi_app.py)
171:     participant ClickRuntime
172:     participant cli_Group as cli (Group Object)
173:     participant hello_Command as hello (Command Object)
174: 
175:     User->>Terminal: python multi_app.py hello
176:     Terminal->>PythonScript: Executes script with args ["hello"]
177:     PythonScript->>ClickRuntime: Calls cli() entry point
178:     ClickRuntime->>cli_Group: Asks to handle args ["hello"]
179:     cli_Group->>cli_Group: Parses args, identifies "hello" as subcommand
180:     cli_Group->>hello_Command: Invokes the 'hello' command
181:     hello_Command->>hello_Command: Executes its callback (the original hello() function)
182:     hello_Command-->>PythonScript: Prints "Hello World!"
183:     PythonScript-->>Terminal: Shows output
184:     Terminal-->>User: Displays "Hello World!"
185: ```
186: 
187: This process of parsing arguments and calling the right function based on the command structure is the core job of Click, making it easy for *you* to just focus on writing the functions for each command.
188: 
189: ## Conclusion
190: 
191: You've learned about the two most fundamental concepts in Click:
192: 
193: *   `Command`: Represents a single action, created by decorating a function with `@click.command()`.
194: *   `Group`: Acts as a container for multiple commands (or other groups), created with `@click.group()`. Groups allow you to structure your CLI application logically.
195: 
196: We saw how Click uses decorators to transform simple Python functions into powerful command-line interface components, automatically handling things like help text generation and command dispatching.
197: 
198: Commands and Groups form the basic structure, but how do we pass information *into* our commands (like `git commit -m "My message"`)? And what other cool things can decorators do? We'll explore that starting with a deeper look at decorators in the next chapter!

  8: # Chapter 2: Decorators: Magic Wands for Your Functions
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: Commands and Groups](01_command___group.md), we learned how to create basic command-line actions (`Command`) and group them together (`Group`). You might have noticed those strange `@click.command()` and `@click.group()` lines above our functions. What are they, and why do we use them?
 11: 
 12: Those are **Decorators**, and they are the heart of how you build Click applications! Think of them as special annotations or modifiers you place *on top* of your Python functions to give them command-line superpowers.
 13: 
 14: ## Why Decorators? Making Life Easier
 15: 
 16: Imagine you didn't have decorators. To create a simple command like `hello` from Chapter 1, you might have to write something like this (this is *not* real Click code, just an illustration):
 17: 
 18: ```python
 19: # NOT how Click works, but imagine...
 20: import click
 21: 
 22: def hello_logic():
 23:   """My command's help text"""
 24:   print("Hello World!")
 25: 
 26: # Manually create a Command object
 27: hello_command = click.Command(
 28:   name='hello',      # Give it a name
 29:   callback=hello_logic, # Tell it which function to run
 30:   help=hello_logic.__doc__ # Copy the help text
 31: )
 32: 
 33: if __name__ == '__main__':
 34:   # Manually parse arguments and run
 35:   # (This part would be complex!)
 36:   pass
 37: ```
 38: 
 39: That looks like a lot more work! You have to:
 40: 
 41: 1.  Write the function (`hello_logic`).
 42: 2.  Manually create a `Command` object.
 43: 3.  Explicitly tell the `Command` object its name, which function to run (`callback`), and its help text.
 44: 
 45: Now, let's remember the Click way from Chapter 1:
 46: 
 47: ```python
 48: # The actual Click way
 49: import click
 50: 
 51: @click.command() # <-- The Decorator!
 52: def hello():
 53:   """A simple command that says Hello World"""
 54:   print("Hello World!")
 55: 
 56: if __name__ == '__main__':
 57:   hello()
 58: ```
 59: 
 60: Much cleaner, right? The `@click.command()` decorator handles creating the `Command` object, figuring out the name (`hello`), and grabbing the help text from the docstring (`"""..."""`) all automatically!
 61: 
 62: Decorators let you *declare* what you want ("this function is a command") right next to the function's code, making your CLI definition much more readable and concise.
 63: 
 64: ## What is a Decorator in Python? (A Quick Peek)
 65: 
 66: Before diving deeper into Click's decorators, let's understand what a decorator *is* in Python itself.
 67: 
 68: In Python, a decorator is essentially a function that takes another function as input and returns a *modified* version of that function. It's like wrapping a gift: you still have the original gift inside, but the wrapping adds something extra.
 69: 
 70: The `@` symbol is just syntactic sugar – a shortcut – for applying a decorator.
 71: 
 72: Here's a super simple example (not using Click):
 73: 
 74: ```python
 75: # A simple Python decorator
 76: def simple_decorator(func):
 77:   def wrapper():
 78:     print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
 79:     func() # Call the original function
 80:     print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
 81:   return wrapper # Return the modified function
 82: 
 83: @simple_decorator # Apply the decorator
 84: def say_whee():
 85:   print("Whee!")
 86: 
 87: # Now, when we call say_whee...
 88: say_whee()
 89: ```
 90: 
 91: Running this would print:
 92: 
 93: ```
 94: Something is happening before the function is called.
 95: Whee!
 96: Something is happening after the function is called.
 97: ```
 98: 
 99: See? `simple_decorator` took our `say_whee` function and wrapped it with extra print statements. The `@simple_decorator` line is equivalent to writing `say_whee = simple_decorator(say_whee)` after defining `say_whee`.
100: 
101: Click's decorators (`@click.command`, `@click.group`, etc.) do something similar, but instead of just printing, they wrap your function inside Click's `Command` or `Group` objects and configure them.
102: 
103: ## Click's Main Decorators
104: 
105: Click provides several decorators. The most common ones you'll use are:
106: 
107: *   `@click.command()`: Turns a function into a single CLI command.
108: *   `@click.group()`: Turns a function into a container for other commands.
109: *   `@click.option()`: Adds an *option* (like `--name` or `-v`) to your command. Options are typically optional parameters.
110: *   `@click.argument()`: Adds an *argument* (like a required filename) to your command. Arguments are typically required and positional.
111: 
112: We already saw `@click.command` and `@click.group` in Chapter 1. Let's focus on how decorators streamline adding commands to groups and introduce options.
113: 
114: ## Decorators in Action: Simplifying Groups and Adding Options
115: 
116: Remember the `multi_app.py` example from Chapter 1? We had to define the group `cli` and the commands `hello` and `goodbye` separately, then manually attach them using `cli.add_command()`.
117: 
118: ```python
119: # multi_app_v1.py (from Chapter 1)
120: import click
121: 
122: @click.group()
123: def cli():
124:   """A simple tool with multiple commands."""
125:   pass
126: 
127: @click.command()
128: def hello():
129:   """Says Hello World"""
130:   print("Hello World!")
131: 
132: @click.command()
133: def goodbye():
134:   """Says Goodbye World"""
135:   print("Goodbye World!")
136: 
137: # Manual attachment
138: cli.add_command(hello)
139: cli.add_command(goodbye)
140: 
141: if __name__ == '__main__':
142:   cli()
143: ```
144: 
145: Decorators provide a more elegant way! If you have a `@click.group()`, you can use *its* `.command()` method as a decorator to automatically attach the command.
146: 
147: Let's rewrite `multi_app.py` using this decorator pattern and also add a simple name option to the `hello` command using `@click.option`:
148: 
149: ```python
150: # multi_app_v2.py (using decorators more effectively)
151: import click
152: 
153: # 1. Create the main group
154: @click.group()
155: def cli():
156:   """A simple tool with multiple commands."""
157:   pass # Group function still doesn't need to do much
158: 
159: # 2. Define 'hello' and attach it to 'cli' using a decorator
160: @cli.command() # <-- Decorator from the 'cli' group object!
161: @click.option('--name', default='World', help='Who to greet.')
162: def hello(name): # The 'name' parameter matches the option
163:   """Says Hello"""
164:   print(f"Hello {name}!")
165: 
166: # 3. Define 'goodbye' and attach it to 'cli' using a decorator
167: @cli.command() # <-- Decorator from the 'cli' group object!
168: def goodbye():
169:   """Says Goodbye"""
170:   print("Goodbye World!")
171: 
172: # No need for cli.add_command() anymore!
173: 
174: if __name__ == '__main__':
175:   cli()
176: ```
177: 
178: What changed?
179: 
180: 1.  Instead of `@click.command()`, we used `@cli.command()` above `hello` and `goodbye`. This tells Click, "This function is a command, *and* it belongs to the `cli` group." No more manual `cli.add_command()` needed!
181: 2.  We added `@click.option('--name', default='World', help='Who to greet.')` right below `@cli.command()` for the `hello` function. This adds a command-line option named `--name`.
182: 3.  The `hello` function now accepts an argument `name`. Click automatically passes the value provided via the `--name` option to this function parameter. If the user doesn't provide `--name`, it uses the `default='World'`.
183: 
184: **Let's run this new version:**
185: 
186: Check the help for the main command:
187: 
188: ```bash
189: $ python multi_app_v2.py --help
190: Usage: multi_app_v2.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
191: 
192:   A simple tool with multiple commands.
193: 
194: Options:
195:   --help  Show this message and exit.
196: 
197: Commands:
198:   goodbye  Says Goodbye
199:   hello    Says Hello
200: ```
201: 
202: Now check the help for the `hello` subcommand:
203: 
204: ```bash
205: $ python multi_app_v2.py hello --help
206: Usage: multi_app_v2.py hello [OPTIONS]
207: 
208:   Says Hello
209: 
210: Options:
211:   --name TEXT  Who to greet.  [default: World]
212:   --help       Show this message and exit.
213: ```
214: 
215: See? The `--name` option is listed, along with its help text and default value!
216: 
217: Finally, run `hello` with and without the option:
218: 
219: ```bash
220: $ python multi_app_v2.py hello
221: Hello World!
222: 
223: $ python multi_app_v2.py hello --name Alice
224: Hello Alice!
225: ```
226: 
227: It works! Decorators made adding the command to the group cleaner, and adding the option was as simple as adding another decorator line and a function parameter. We'll learn much more about configuring options and arguments in the next chapter, [Parameter (Option / Argument)](03_parameter__option___argument_.md).
228: 
229: ## How Click Decorators Work (Under the Hood)
230: 
231: So what's the "magic" behind these `@` symbols in Click?
232: 
233: 1.  **Decorator Functions:** When you write `@click.command()` or `@click.option()`, you're calling functions defined in Click (specifically in `decorators.py`). These functions are designed to *return another function* (the actual decorator).
234: 2.  **Wrapping the User Function:** Python takes the function you defined (e.g., `hello`) and passes it to the decorator function returned in step 1.
235: 3.  **Attaching Information:**
236:     *   `@click.option` / `@click.argument`: These decorators typically don't create the final `Command` object immediately. Instead, they attach the parameter information (like the option name `--name`, type, default value) to your function object itself, often using a special temporary attribute (like `__click_params__`). They then return the *original function*, but now with this extra metadata attached.
237:     *   `@click.command` / `@click.group`: This decorator usually runs *last* (decorators are applied bottom-up). It looks for any parameter information attached by previous `@option` or `@argument` decorators (like `__click_params__`). It then creates the actual `Command` or `Group` object (defined in `core.py`), configures it with the command name, help text (from the docstring), the attached parameters, and stores your original function as the `callback` to be executed. It returns this newly created `Command` or `Group` object, effectively replacing your original function definition with the Click object.
238: 4.  **Group Attachment:** When you use `@cli.command()`, the `@cli.command()` decorator not only creates the `Command` object but also automatically calls `cli.add_command()` to register the new command with the `cli` group object.
239: 
240: Here's a simplified sequence diagram showing what happens when you define the `hello` command in `multi_app_v2.py`:
241: 
242: ```mermaid
243: sequenceDiagram
244:     participant PythonInterpreter
245:     participant click_option as @click.option('--name')
246:     participant hello_func as hello(name)
247:     participant cli_command as @cli.command()
248:     participant cli_Group as cli (Group Object)
249:     participant hello_Command as hello (New Command Object)
250: 
251:     Note over PythonInterpreter, hello_func: Python processes decorators bottom-up
252:     PythonInterpreter->>click_option: Processes @click.option('--name', ...) decorator
253:     click_option->>hello_func: Attaches Option info (like in __click_params__)
254:     click_option-->>PythonInterpreter: Returns original hello_func (with attached info)
255: 
256:     PythonInterpreter->>cli_command: Processes @cli.command() decorator
257:     cli_command->>hello_func: Reads function name, docstring, attached params (__click_params__)
258:     cli_command->>hello_Command: Creates new Command object for 'hello'
259:     cli_command->>cli_Group: Calls cli.add_command(hello_Command)
260:     cli_command-->>PythonInterpreter: Returns the new hello_Command object
261: 
262:     Note over PythonInterpreter: 'hello' in the code now refers to the Command object
263: ```
264: 
265: The key takeaway is that decorators allow Click to gather all the necessary information (function logic, command name, help text, options, arguments) right where you define the function, and build the corresponding Click objects behind the scenes. You can find the implementation details in `click/decorators.py` and `click/core.py`. The `_param_memo` helper function in `decorators.py` is often used internally by `@option` and `@argument` to attach parameter info to the function before `@command` processes it.
266: 
267: ## Conclusion
268: 
269: Decorators are fundamental to Click's design philosophy. They provide a clean, readable, and *declarative* way to turn your Python functions into powerful command-line interface components.
270: 
271: You've learned:
272: 
273: *   Decorators are Python features (`@`) that modify functions.
274: *   Click uses decorators like `@click.command`, `@click.group`, `@click.option`, and `@click.argument` extensively.
275: *   Decorators handle the creation and configuration of `Command`, `Group`, `Option`, and `Argument` objects for you.
276: *   Using decorators like `@group.command()` automatically attaches commands to groups.
277: *   They make defining your CLI structure intuitive and keep related code together.
278: 
279: We've only scratched the surface of `@click.option` and `@click.argument`. How do you make options required? How do you handle different data types (numbers, files)? How do you define arguments that take multiple values? We'll explore all of this in the next chapter!

  8: # Chapter 3: Parameter (Option / Argument) - Giving Your Commands Input
  9: 
 10: In the last chapter, [Decorators](02_decorators.md), we saw how decorators like `@click.command()` and `@click.option()` act like magic wands, transforming our Python functions into CLI commands and adding features like command-line options.
 11: 
 12: But how do our commands actually *receive* information from the user? If we have a command `greet`, how do we tell it *who* to greet, like `greet --name Alice`? Or if we have a `copy` command, how do we specify the source and destination files, like `copy report.txt backup.txt`?
 13: 
 14: This is where **Parameters** come in. Parameters define the inputs your commands can accept, just like arguments define the inputs for a regular Python function. Click handles parsing these inputs from the command line, validating them, and making them available to your command function.
 15: 
 16: There are two main types of parameters in Click:
 17: 
 18: 1.  **Options:** These are usually preceded by flags like `--verbose` or `-f`. They are often optional and can either take a value (like `--name Alice`) or act as simple on/off switches (like `--verbose`). You define them using the `@click.option()` decorator.
 19: 2.  **Arguments:** These are typically positional values that come *after* any options. They often represent required inputs, like a filename (`report.txt`). You define them using the `@click.argument()` decorator.
 20: 
 21: Let's see how to use them!
 22: 
 23: ## Options: The Named Inputs (`@click.option`)
 24: 
 25: Think of options like keyword arguments in Python functions. In `def greet(name="World"):`, `name` is a keyword argument with a default value. Options serve a similar purpose for your CLI.
 26: 
 27: Let's modify our `hello` command from the previous chapter to accept a `--name` option.
 28: 
 29: ```python
 30: # greet_app.py
 31: import click
 32: 
 33: @click.group()
 34: def cli():
 35:   """A simple tool with a greeting command."""
 36:   pass
 37: 
 38: @cli.command()
 39: @click.option('--name', default='World', help='Who to greet.')
 40: def hello(name): # <-- The 'name' parameter matches the option
 41:   """Greets the person specified by the --name option."""
 42:   print(f"Hello {name}!")
 43: 
 44: if __name__ == '__main__':
 45:   cli()
 46: ```
 47: 
 48: Let's break down the new parts:
 49: 
 50: 1.  `@click.option('--name', default='World', help='Who to greet.')`: This decorator defines an option.
 51:     *   `'--name'`: This is the primary name of the option on the command line.
 52:     *   `default='World'`: If the user doesn't provide the `--name` option, the value `World` will be used.
 53:     *   `help='Who to greet.'`: This text will appear in the help message for the `hello` command.
 54: 2.  `def hello(name):`: Notice how the `hello` function now accepts an argument named `name`. Click cleverly matches the option name (`name`) to the function parameter name and passes the value automatically!
 55: 
 56: **Try running it!**
 57: 
 58: First, check the help message for the `hello` command:
 59: 
 60: ```bash
 61: $ python greet_app.py hello --help
 62: Usage: greet_app.py hello [OPTIONS]
 63: 
 64:   Greets the person specified by the --name option.
 65: 
 66: Options:
 67:   --name TEXT  Who to greet.  [default: World]
 68:   --help       Show this message and exit.
 69: ```
 70: 
 71: See? Click added our `--name` option to the help screen, including the help text and default value we provided. The `TEXT` part indicates the type of value expected (we'll cover types in [ParamType](04_paramtype.md)).
 72: 
 73: Now, run it with and without the option:
 74: 
 75: ```bash
 76: $ python greet_app.py hello
 77: Hello World!
 78: 
 79: $ python greet_app.py hello --name Alice
 80: Hello Alice!
 81: ```
 82: 
 83: It works perfectly! Click parsed the `--name Alice` option and passed `"Alice"` to our `hello` function's `name` parameter. When we didn't provide the option, it used the default value `"World"`.
 84: 
 85: ### Option Flavors: Short Names and Flags
 86: 
 87: Options can have variations:
 88: 
 89: *   **Short Names:** You can provide shorter aliases, like `-n` for `--name`.
 90: *   **Flags:** Options that don't take a value but act as switches (e.g., `--verbose`).
 91: 
 92: Let's add a short name `-n` to our `--name` option and a `--shout` flag to make the greeting uppercase.
 93: 
 94: ```python
 95: # greet_app_v2.py
 96: import click
 97: 
 98: @click.group()
 99: def cli():
100:   """A simple tool with a greeting command."""
101:   pass
102: 
103: @cli.command()
104: @click.option('--name', '-n', default='World', help='Who to greet.') # Added '-n'
105: @click.option('--shout', is_flag=True, help='Greet loudly.')        # Added '--shout' flag
106: def hello(name, shout): # <-- Function now accepts 'shout' too
107:   """Greets the person, optionally shouting."""
108:   greeting = f"Hello {name}!"
109:   if shout:
110:     greeting = greeting.upper()
111:   print(greeting)
112: 
113: if __name__ == '__main__':
114:   cli()
115: ```
116: 
117: Changes:
118: 
119: 1.  `@click.option('--name', '-n', ...)`: We added `'-n'` as the second argument to the decorator. Now, both `--name` and `-n` work.
120: 2.  `@click.option('--shout', is_flag=True, ...)`: This defines a flag. `is_flag=True` tells Click this option doesn't take a value; its presence makes the corresponding parameter `True`, otherwise it's `False`.
121: 3.  `def hello(name, shout):`: The function signature is updated to accept the `shout` parameter.
122: 
123: **Run it again!**
124: 
125: ```bash
126: $ python greet_app_v2.py hello -n Bob
127: Hello Bob!
128: 
129: $ python greet_app_v2.py hello --name Carol --shout
130: HELLO CAROL!
131: 
132: $ python greet_app_v2.py hello --shout
133: HELLO WORLD!
134: ```
135: 
136: Flags and short names make your CLI more flexible and conventional!
137: 
138: ## Arguments: The Positional Inputs (`@click.argument`)
139: 
140: Arguments are like positional arguments in Python functions. In `def copy(src, dst):`, `src` and `dst` are required positional arguments. Click arguments usually represent mandatory inputs that follow the command and any options.
141: 
142: Let's create a simple command that takes two arguments, `SRC` and `DST`, representing source and destination files (though we'll just print them for now).
143: 
144: ```python
145: # copy_app.py
146: import click
147: 
148: @click.command()
149: @click.argument('src')  # Defines the first argument
150: @click.argument('dst')  # Defines the second argument
151: def copy(src, dst):     # Function parameters match argument names
152:   """Copies SRC file to DST."""
153:   print(f"Pretending to copy '{src}' to '{dst}'")
154: 
155: if __name__ == '__main__':
156:   copy()
157: ```
158: 
159: What's happening here?
160: 
161: 1.  `@click.argument('src')`: Defines a positional argument named `src`. By default, arguments are required. The name `'src'` is used both internally and often capitalized (`SRC`) in help messages by convention.
162: 2.  `@click.argument('dst')`: Defines the second required positional argument.
163: 3.  `def copy(src, dst):`: The function parameters `src` and `dst` receive the values provided on the command line in the order they appear.
164: 
165: **Let's try it!**
166: 
167: First, see what happens if we forget the arguments:
168: 
169: ```bash
170: $ python copy_app.py
171: Usage: copy_app.py [OPTIONS] SRC DST
172: Try 'copy_app.py --help' for help.
173: 
174: Error: Missing argument 'SRC'.
175: ```
176: 
177: Click automatically detects the missing argument and gives a helpful error message!
178: 
179: Now, provide the arguments:
180: 
181: ```bash
182: $ python copy_app.py report.txt backup/report.txt
183: Pretending to copy 'report.txt' to 'backup/report.txt'
184: ```
185: 
186: Click correctly captured the positional arguments and passed them to our `copy` function.
187: 
188: Arguments are essential for inputs that are fundamental to the command's operation, like the files to operate on. Options are better suited for modifying the command's behavior.
189: 
190: *(Note: Arguments can also be made optional or accept variable numbers of inputs, often involving the `required` and `nargs` settings, which tie into concepts we'll explore more in [ParamType](04_paramtype.md).)*
191: 
192: ## How Parameters Work Together
193: 
194: When you run a command like `python greet_app_v2.py hello --shout -n Alice`, Click performs a sequence of steps:
195: 
196: 1.  **Parsing:** Click looks at the command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) provided by the operating system: `['greet_app_v2.py', 'hello', '--shout', '-n', 'Alice']`.
197: 2.  **Command Identification:** It identifies `hello` as the command to execute.
198: 3.  **Parameter Matching:** It scans the remaining arguments (`['--shout', '-n', 'Alice']`).
199:     *   It sees `--shout`. It looks up the parameters defined for the `hello` command (using the `@click.option` and `@click.argument` decorators). It finds the `shout` option definition (which has `is_flag=True`). It marks the value for `shout` as `True`.
200:     *   It sees `-n`. It finds the `name` option definition (which includes `-n` as an alias and expects a value).
201:     *   It sees `Alice`. Since the previous token (`-n`) expected a value, Click associates `"Alice"` with the `-n` (and thus `--name`) option. It marks the value for `name` as `"Alice"`.
202: 4.  **Validation & Conversion:** Click checks if all required parameters are present (they are). It also performs type conversion (though in this case, the default is string, which matches "Alice"). We'll see more complex conversions in the next chapter.
203: 5.  **Function Call:** Finally, Click calls the command's underlying Python function (`hello`) with the collected values as keyword arguments: `hello(name='Alice', shout=True)`.
204: 
205: Here's a simplified view of the process:
206: 
207: ```mermaid
208: sequenceDiagram

221:     ClickRuntime->>ClickRuntime: Consumes 'Alice' as value for '-n'/'name' parameter (value="Alice")
222:     ClickRuntime->>ClickRuntime: Validates parameters, performs type conversion
223:     ClickRuntime->>hello_func: Calls callback: hello(name="Alice", shout=True)
224:     hello_func-->>PythonScript: Prints "HELLO ALICE!"
225:     PythonScript-->>Terminal: Shows output
226:     Terminal-->>User: Displays "HELLO ALICE!"
227: ```
228: 
229: ## Under the Hood: Decorators and Parameter Objects
230: 
231: How do `@click.option` and `@click.argument` actually work with `@click.command`?
232: 
233: 1.  **Parameter Definition (`decorators.py`, `core.py`):** When you use `@click.option(...)` or `@click.argument(...)`, these functions (defined in `click/decorators.py`) create instances of the `Option` or `Argument` classes (defined in `click/core.py`). These objects store all the configuration you provided (like `--name`, `-n`, `default='World'`, `is_flag=True`, etc.).
234: 2.  **Attaching to Function (`decorators.py`):** Crucially, these decorators don't immediately add the parameters to a command. Instead, they attach the created `Option` or `Argument` object to the function they are decorating. Click uses a helper mechanism (like the internal `_param_memo` function which adds to a `__click_params__` list) to store these parameter objects *on* the function object temporarily.
235: 3.  **Command Creation (`decorators.py`, `core.py`):** The `@click.command()` decorator (or `@group.command()`) runs *after* all the `@option` and `@argument` decorators for that function. It looks for the attached parameter objects (the `__click_params__` list). It gathers these objects and passes them to the constructor of the `Command` (or `Group`) object it creates. The `Command` object stores these parameters in its `params` attribute.
236: 4.  **Parsing (`parser.py`, `core.py`):** When the command is invoked, the `Command` object uses its `params` list to configure an internal parser (historically based on Python's `optparse`, see `click/parser.py`). This parser processes the command-line string (`sys.argv`) according to the rules defined by the `Option` and `Argument` objects in the `params` list.
237: 5.  **Callback Invocation (`core.py`):** After parsing and validation, Click takes the resulting values and calls the original Python function (stored as the `Command.callback`), passing the values as arguments.
238: 
239: So, the decorators work together: `@option`/`@argument` define the parameters and temporarily attach them to the function, while `@command` collects these definitions and builds the final `Command` object, ready for parsing.
240: 
241: ## Conclusion
242: 
243: You've learned how to make your Click commands interactive by defining inputs using **Parameters**:
244: 
245: *   **Options (`@click.option`):** Named inputs, often optional, specified with flags (`--name`, `-n`). Great for controlling behavior (like `--verbose`, `--shout`) or providing specific pieces of data (`--output file.txt`).
246: *   **Arguments (`@click.argument`):** Positional inputs, often required, that follow options (`input.csv`). Ideal for core data the command operates on (like source/destination files).
247: 
248: You saw how Click uses decorators to define these parameters and automatically handles parsing the command line, providing default values, generating help messages, and passing the final values to your Python function.
249: 
250: But what if you want an option to accept only numbers? Or a choice from a predefined list? Or maybe an argument that represents a file path that must exist? Click handles this through **Parameter Types**. Let's explore those next!

  8: # Chapter 4: ParamType - Checking and Converting Inputs
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 3: Parameter (Option / Argument)](03_parameter__option___argument_.md), we learned how to define inputs for our commands using `@click.option` and `@click.argument`. Our `greet` command could take a `--name` option, and our `copy` command took `SRC` and `DST` arguments.
 11: 
 12: But what if we need more control? What if our command needs a *number* as input, like `--count 3`? Or what if an option should only accept specific words, like `--level easy` or `--level hard`? Right now, Click treats most inputs as simple text strings.
 13: 
 14: This is where **ParamType** comes in! Think of `ParamType`s as the **gatekeepers** and **translators** for your command-line inputs. They:
 15: 
 16: 1.  **Validate:** Check if the user's input looks correct (e.g., "Is this actually a number?").
 17: 2.  **Convert:** Change the input text (which is always initially a string) into the Python type you need (e.g., the string `"3"` becomes the integer `3`).
 18: 
 19: `ParamType`s make your commands more robust by catching errors early and giving your Python code the data types it expects.
 20: 
 21: ## Why Do We Need ParamTypes?
 22: 
 23: Imagine you're writing a command to repeat a message multiple times:
 24: 
 25: ```bash
 26: repeat --times 5 "Hello!"
 27: ```
 28: 
 29: Inside your Python function, you want the `times` variable to be an integer so you can use it in a loop. If the user types `repeat --times five "Hello!"`, your code might crash if it tries to use the string `"five"` like a number.
 30: 
 31: `ParamType` solves this. By telling Click that the `--times` option expects an integer, Click will automatically:
 32: 
 33: *   Check if the input (`"5"`) can be turned into an integer.
 34: *   If yes, convert it to the integer `5` and pass it to your function.
 35: *   If no (like `"five"`), stop immediately and show the user a helpful error message *before* your function even runs!
 36: 
 37: ## Using Built-in ParamTypes
 38: 
 39: Click provides several ready-to-use `ParamType`s. You specify which one to use with the `type` argument in `@click.option` or `@click.argument`.
 40: 
 41: Let's modify an example to use `click.INT`.
 42: 
 43: ```python
 44: # count_app.py
 45: import click
 46: 
 47: @click.command()
 48: @click.option('--count', default=1, type=click.INT, help='Number of times to print.')
 49: @click.argument('message')
 50: def repeat(count, message):
 51:   """Prints MESSAGE the specified number of times."""
 52:   # 'count' is now guaranteed to be an integer!
 53:   for _ in range(count):
 54:     click.echo(message)
 55: 
 56: if __name__ == '__main__':
 57:   repeat()
 58: ```
 59: 
 60: Breakdown:
 61: 
 62: 1.  `import click`: As always.
 63: 2.  `@click.option('--count', ..., type=click.INT, ...)`: This is the key change! We added `type=click.INT`. This tells Click that the value provided for `--count` must be convertible to an integer. `click.INT` is one of Click's built-in `ParamType` instances.
 64: 3.  `def repeat(count, message):`: The `count` parameter in our function will receive the *converted* integer value.
 65: 
 66: **Let's run it!**
 67: 
 68: ```bash
 69: $ python count_app.py --count 3 "Woohoo!"
 70: Woohoo!
 71: Woohoo!
 72: Woohoo!
 73: ```
 74: 
 75: It works! Click converted the input string `"3"` into the Python integer `3` before calling our `repeat` function.
 76: 
 77: Now, see what happens with invalid input:
 78: 
 79: ```bash
 80: $ python count_app.py --count five "Oh no"
 81: Usage: count_app.py [OPTIONS] MESSAGE
 82: Try 'count_app.py --help' for help.
 83: 
 84: Error: Invalid value for '--count': 'five' is not a valid integer.
 85: ```
 86: 
 87: Perfect! Click caught the error because `"five"` couldn't be converted by `click.INT`. It printed a helpful message and prevented our `repeat` function from running with bad data.
 88: 
 89: ## Common Built-in Types
 90: 
 91: Click offers several useful built-in types:
 92: 
 93: *   `click.STRING`: The default type. Converts the input to a string (usually doesn't change much unless the input was bytes).
 94: *   `click.INT`: Converts to an integer. Fails if the input isn't a valid whole number.
 95: *   `click.FLOAT`: Converts to a floating-point number. Fails if the input isn't a valid number (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.5`).
 96: *   `click.BOOL`: Converts to a boolean (`True`/`False`). It's clever and understands inputs like `'1'`, `'true'`, `'t'`, `'yes'`, `'y'`, `'on'` as `True`, and `'0'`, `'false'`, `'f'`, `'no'`, `'n'`, `'off'` as `False`. Usually used for options that aren't flags.
 97: *   `click.Choice`: Checks if the value is one of a predefined list of choices.
 98: 
 99:     ```python
100:     # choice_example.py
101:     import click
102: 
103:     @click.command()
104:     @click.option('--difficulty', type=click.Choice(['easy', 'medium', 'hard'], case_sensitive=False), default='easy')
105:     def setup(difficulty):
106:         click.echo(f"Setting up game with difficulty: {difficulty}")
107: 
108:     if __name__ == '__main__':
109:         setup()
110:     ```
111: 
112:     Running `python choice_example.py --difficulty MeDiUm` works (because `case_sensitive=False`), but `python choice_example.py --difficulty expert` would fail.
113: 
114: *   `click.Path`: Represents a filesystem path. It can check if the path exists, if it's a file or directory, and if it has certain permissions (read/write/execute). It returns the path as a string (or `pathlib.Path` if configured).
115: 
116:     ```python
117:     # path_example.py
118:     import click
119: 
120:     @click.command()
121:     @click.argument('output_dir', type=click.Path(exists=True, file_okay=False, dir_okay=True, writable=True))
122:     def process(output_dir):
123:         click.echo(f"Processing data into directory: {output_dir}")
124:         # We know output_dir exists, is a directory, and is writable!
125: 
126:     if __name__ == '__main__':
127:         process()
128:     ```
129: 
130: *   `click.File`: Similar to `Path`, but it *automatically opens* the file and passes the open file object to your function. It also handles closing the file automatically. You can specify the mode (`'r'`, `'w'`, `'rb'`, `'wb'`).
131: 
132:     ```python
133:     # file_example.py
134:     import click
135: 
136:     @click.command()
137:     @click.argument('input_file', type=click.File('r')) # Open for reading text
138:     def cat(input_file):
139:         # input_file is an open file handle!
140:         click.echo(input_file.read())
141:         # Click will close the file automatically after this function returns
142: 
143:     if __name__ == '__main__':
144:         cat()
145:     ```
146: 
147: These built-in types cover most common use cases for validating and converting command-line inputs.
148: 
149: ## How ParamTypes Work Under the Hood
150: 
151: What happens when you specify `type=click.INT`?
152: 
153: 1.  **Parsing:** As described in [Chapter 3](03_parameter__option___argument_.md), Click's parser identifies the command-line arguments and matches them to your defined `Option`s and `Argument`s. It finds the raw string value provided by the user (e.g., `"3"` for `--count`).
154: 2.  **Type Retrieval:** The parser looks at the `Parameter` object (the `Option` or `Argument`) and finds the `type` you assigned to it (e.g., the `click.INT` instance).
155: 3.  **Conversion Attempt:** The parser calls the `convert()` method of the `ParamType` instance, passing the raw string value (`"3"`), the parameter object itself, and the current [Context](05_context.md).
156: 4.  **Validation & Conversion Logic (Inside `ParamType.convert`)**:
157:     *   The `click.INT.convert()` method tries to call Python's built-in `int("3")`.
158:     *   If this succeeds, it returns the result (the integer `3`).
159:     *   If it fails (e.g., `int("five")` would raise a `ValueError`), the `convert()` method catches this error.
160: 5.  **Success or Failure**:
161:     *   **Success:** The parser receives the converted value (`3`) and stores it. Later, it passes this value to your command function.
162:     *   **Failure:** The `convert()` method calls its `fail()` helper method. The `fail()` method raises a `click.BadParameter` exception with a helpful error message (e.g., "'five' is not a valid integer."). Click catches this exception, stops further processing, and displays the error message to the user along with usage instructions.
163: 
164: Here's a simplified view of the successful conversion process:

201: ```
202: 
203: The core logic for built-in types resides in `click/types.py`. Each type (like `IntParamType`, `Choice`, `Path`) inherits from the base `ParamType` class and implements its own `convert` method containing the specific validation and conversion rules.
204: 
205: ```python
206: # Simplified structure from click/types.py
207: 
208: class ParamType:
209:     name: str  # Human-readable name like "integer" or "filename"
210: 
211:     def convert(self, value, param, ctx):
212:         # Must be implemented by subclasses
213:         # Should return the converted value or call self.fail()
214:         raise NotImplementedError
215: 
216:     def fail(self, message, param, ctx):
217:         # Raises a BadParameter exception
218:         raise BadParameter(message, ctx=ctx, param=param)
219: 
220: class IntParamType(ParamType):
221:     name = "integer"
222: 
223:     def convert(self, value, param, ctx):
224:         try:
225:             # The core conversion logic!
226:             return int(value)
227:         except ValueError:
228:             # If conversion fails, raise the standard error
229:             self.fail(f"{value!r} is not a valid integer.", param, ctx)
230: 
231: # click.INT is just an instance of this class
232: INT = IntParamType()
233: ```
234: 
235: ## Custom Types
236: 
237: What if none of the built-in types do exactly what you need? Click allows you to create your own custom `ParamType`s! You can do this by subclassing `click.ParamType` and implementing the `name` attribute and the `convert` method. This is an advanced topic, but it provides great flexibility.
238: 
239: ## Shell Completion Hints
240: 
241: An added benefit of using specific `ParamType`s is that they can provide hints for shell completion (when the user presses Tab). For example:
242: *   `click.Choice(['easy', 'medium', 'hard'])` can suggest `easy`, `medium`, or `hard`.
243: *   `click.Path` can suggest file and directory names from the current location.
244: 
245: This makes your CLI even more user-friendly.
246: 
247: ## Conclusion
248: 
249: `ParamType`s are a fundamental part of Click, acting as the bridge between raw command-line text input and the well-typed data your Python functions need. They handle the crucial tasks of:
250: 
251: *   **Validating** user input against expected formats or rules.
252: *   **Converting** input strings to appropriate Python types (integers, booleans, files, etc.).
253: *   **Generating** user-friendly error messages for invalid input.
254: *   Providing hints for **shell completion**.
255: 
256: By using built-in types like `click.INT`, `click.Choice`, `click.Path`, and `click.File`, you make your commands more robust, reliable, and easier to use.
257: 
258: So far, we've seen how commands are structured, how parameters get their values, and how those values are validated and converted. But how does Click manage the state *during* the execution of a command? How does it know which command is running or what the parent commands were? That's the job of the `Context`. Let's explore that next!

  8: # Chapter 5: Context - The Command's Nervous System
  9: 
 10: In the last chapter, [ParamType](04_paramtype.md), we saw how Click helps validate and convert user input into the right Python types, making our commands more robust. We used types like `click.INT` and `click.Path` to ensure data correctness.
 11: 
 12: But what happens *while* a command is running? How does Click keep track of which command is being executed, what parameters were passed, or even shared information between different commands in a nested structure (like `git remote add ...`)?
 13: 
 14: This is where the **Context** object, often referred to as `ctx`, comes into play. Think of the Context as the central nervous system for a single command invocation. It carries all the vital information about the current state of execution.
 15: 
 16: ## Why Do We Need a Context?
 17: 
 18: Imagine you have a command that needs to behave differently based on a global configuration, maybe a `--verbose` flag set on the main application group. Or perhaps one command needs to call another command within the same application. How do they communicate?
 19: 
 20: The Context object solves these problems by providing a central place to:
 21: 
 22: *   Access parameters passed to the *current* command.
 23: *   Access parameters or settings from *parent* commands.
 24: *   Share application-level objects (like configuration settings or database connections) between commands.
 25: *   Manage resources that need cleanup (like automatically closing files opened with `click.File`).
 26: *   Invoke other commands programmatically.
 27: 
 28: Let's explore how to access and use this powerful object.
 29: 
 30: ## Getting the Context: `@pass_context`
 31: 
 32: Click doesn't automatically pass the Context object to your command function. You need to explicitly ask for it using a special decorator: `@click.pass_context`.
 33: 
 34: When you add `@click.pass_context` *above* your function definition (but typically *below* the `@click.command` or `@click.option` decorators), Click will automatically **inject** the `Context` object as the **very first argument** to your function.
 35: 
 36: Let's see a simple example:
 37: 
 38: ```python
 39: # context_basics.py
 40: import click
 41: 
 42: @click.group()
 43: @click.pass_context # Request the context for the group function
 44: def cli(ctx):
 45:   """A simple CLI with context."""
 46:   # We can store arbitrary data on the context's 'obj' attribute
 47:   ctx.obj = {'verbose': False} # Initialize a shared dictionary
 48: 
 49: @cli.command()
 50: @click.option('--verbose', is_flag=True, help='Enable verbose mode.')
 51: @click.pass_context # Request the context for the command function
 52: def info(ctx, verbose):
 53:   """Prints info, possibly verbosely."""
 54:   # Access the command name from the context
 55:   click.echo(f"Executing command: {ctx.command.name}")
 56: 
 57:   # Access parameters passed to *this* command
 58:   click.echo(f"Verbose flag (local): {verbose}")
 59: 
 60:   # We can modify the shared object from the parent context
 61:   if verbose:
 62:     ctx.obj['verbose'] = True
 63: 
 64:   # Access the shared object from the parent context
 65:   click.echo(f"Verbose setting (shared): {ctx.obj['verbose']}")
 66: 
 67: if __name__ == '__main__':
 68:   cli()
 69: ```
 70: 
 71: Let's break it down:
 72: 
 73: 1.  `@click.pass_context`: We apply this decorator to both the `cli` group function and the `info` command function.
 74: 2.  `def cli(ctx): ...`: Because of `@pass_context`, the `cli` function now receives the `Context` object as its first argument, which we've named `ctx`.
 75: 3.  `ctx.obj = {'verbose': False}`: The `ctx.obj` attribute is a special place designed for you to store and share *your own* application data. Here, the main `cli` group initializes it as a dictionary. This object will be automatically inherited by child command contexts.
 76: 4.  `def info(ctx, verbose): ...`: The `info` command function also receives the `Context` (`ctx`) as its first argument, followed by its own parameters (`verbose`).
 77: 5.  `ctx.command.name`: We access the `Command` object associated with the current context via `ctx.command` and get its name.
 78: 6.  `ctx.obj['verbose'] = True`: We can *modify* the shared `ctx.obj` from within the subcommand.
 79: 7.  `click.echo(f"Verbose setting (shared): {ctx.obj['verbose']}")`: We access the potentially modified shared state.
 80: 
 81: **Run it!**
 82: 
 83: ```bash
 84: $ python context_basics.py info
 85: Executing command: info
 86: Verbose flag (local): False
 87: Verbose setting (shared): False
 88: 
 89: $ python context_basics.py info --verbose
 90: Executing command: info
 91: Verbose flag (local): True
 92: Verbose setting (shared): True
 93: ```
 94: 
 95: You can see how `@pass_context` gives us access to the runtime environment (`ctx.command.name`) and allows us to use `ctx.obj` to share state between the parent group (`cli`) and the subcommand (`info`).
 96: 
 97: ## Key Context Attributes
 98: 
 99: The `Context` object has several useful attributes:
100: 
101: *   `ctx.command`: The [Command](01_command___group.md) object that this context belongs to. You can get its name (`ctx.command.name`), parameters, etc.
102: *   `ctx.parent`: The context of the invoking command. If this is the top-level command, `ctx.parent` will be `None`. This forms a linked list or chain back to the root context.
103: *   `ctx.params`: A dictionary mapping parameter names to the *final* values passed to the command, after parsing, type conversion, and defaults have been applied.
104:     ```python
105:     # access_params.py
106:     import click
107: 
108:     @click.command()
109:     @click.option('--name', default='Guest')
110:     @click.pass_context
111:     def hello(ctx, name):
112:       click.echo(f"Hello, {name}!")
113:       # Access the parameter value directly via ctx.params
114:       click.echo(f"(Value from ctx.params: {ctx.params['name']})")
115: 
116:     if __name__ == '__main__':
117:       hello()
118:     ```
119:     Running `python access_params.py --name Alice` would show `Hello, Alice!` and `(Value from ctx.params: Alice)`.
120: *   `ctx.obj`: As seen before, this is an arbitrary object that gets passed down the context chain. It's commonly used for shared configuration, database connections, or other application-level state. You can also use `@click.pass_obj` as a shortcut if you *only* need `ctx.obj`.
121: *   `ctx.info_name`: The name that was used on the command line to invoke this command or group (e.g., `info` in `python context_basics.py info`).
122: *   `ctx.invoked_subcommand`: For groups, this holds the name of the subcommand that was invoked (or `None` if no subcommand was called).
123: 
124: ## Calling Other Commands
125: 
126: Sometimes, you want one command to trigger another. The Context provides methods for this:
127: 
128: *   `ctx.invoke(other_command, **params)`: Calls another Click command (`other_command`), passing the current context's parent (`ctx.parent`) as the new command's parent. It uses the provided `params` for the call.
129: *   `ctx.forward(other_command)`: Similar to `invoke`, but it automatically passes all parameters from the *current* context (`ctx.params`) to the `other_command`. This is useful for creating alias commands.
130: 
131: ```python
132: # invoke_example.py
133: import click
134: 
135: @click.group()
136: def cli():
137:   pass
138: 
139: @cli.command()
140: @click.argument('text')
141: def print_it(text):
142:   """Prints the given text."""
143:   click.echo(f"Printing: {text}")
144: 
145: @cli.command()
146: @click.argument('message')
147: @click.pass_context # Need context to call invoke
148: def shout(ctx, message):
149:   """Shouts the message by calling print_it."""
150:   click.echo("About to invoke print_it...")
151:   # Call the 'print_it' command, passing the uppercased message
152:   ctx.invoke(print_it, text=message.upper())
153:   click.echo("Finished invoking print_it.")
154: 
155: if __name__ == '__main__':
156:   cli()
157: ```
158: 
159: Running `python invoke_example.py shout "hello world"` will output:
160: 
161: ```
162: About to invoke print_it...
163: Printing: HELLO WORLD
164: Finished invoking print_it.
165: ```
166: 
167: The `shout` command successfully called the `print_it` command programmatically using `ctx.invoke()`.
168: 
169: ## Resource Management (`ctx.call_on_close`)
170: 
171: Click uses the context internally to manage resources. For instance, when you use `type=click.File('w')`, Click opens the file and registers a cleanup function using `ctx.call_on_close(file.close)`. This ensures the file is closed when the context is finished, even if errors occur.
172: 
173: You can use this mechanism yourself if you need custom resource cleanup tied to the command's lifecycle.
174: 
175: ```python
176: # resource_management.py
177: import click
178: 
179: class MockResource:
180:   def __init__(self, name):
181:     self.name = name
182:     click.echo(f"Resource '{self.name}' opened.")
183:   def close(self):
184:     click.echo(f"Resource '{self.name}' closed.")
185: 
186: @click.command()
187: @click.pass_context
188: def process(ctx):
189:   """Opens and closes a mock resource."""
190:   res = MockResource("DataFile")
191:   # Register the close method to be called when the context ends
192:   ctx.call_on_close(res.close)
193:   click.echo("Processing with resource...")
194:   # Function ends, context tears down, call_on_close triggers
195: 
196: if __name__ == '__main__':
197:   process()
198: ```
199: 
200: Running this script will show:
201: 
202: ```
203: Resource 'DataFile' opened.
204: Processing with resource...
205: Resource 'DataFile' closed.
206: ```
207: 
208: The resource was automatically closed because we registered its `close` method with `ctx.call_on_close`.
209: 
210: ## How Context Works Under the Hood
211: 
212: 1.  **Initial Context:** When you run your Click application (e.g., by calling `cli()`), Click creates the first `Context` object associated with the top-level command or group (`cli` in our examples).
213: 2.  **Parsing and Subcommand:** Click parses the command-line arguments. If a subcommand is identified (like `info` in `python context_basics.py info`), Click finds the corresponding `Command` object.
214: 3.  **Child Context Creation:** Before executing the subcommand's callback function, Click creates a *new* `Context` object for the subcommand. Crucially, it sets the `parent` attribute of this new context to the context of the invoking command (the `cli` context in our example).
215: 4.  **Object Inheritance:** The `ctx.obj` attribute is automatically passed down from the parent context to the child context *by reference* (unless the child explicitly sets its own `ctx.obj`).
216: 5.  **`@pass_context` Decorator:** This decorator (defined in `decorators.py`) wraps your callback function. When the wrapped function is called, the decorator uses `click.globals.get_current_context()` (which accesses a thread-local stack of contexts) to fetch the *currently active* context and inserts it as the first argument before calling your original function.
217: 6.  **`ctx.invoke`:** When you call `ctx.invoke(other_cmd, ...)`, Click finds the `other_cmd` object, creates a *new* context for it (setting its parent to `ctx.parent`), populates its `params` from the arguments you provided, and then executes `other_cmd`'s callback within that new context.
218: 7.  **Cleanup:** Once a command function finishes (or raises an exception that Click handles), its corresponding context is "torn down". This is when any functions registered with `ctx.call_on_close` are executed.
219: 
220: Here's a simplified diagram showing context creation and `ctx.obj` flow for `python context_basics.py info --verbose`:

253:     ClickRuntime-->>CLI: Exits
254: ```
255: 
256: The core `Context` class is defined in `click/core.py`. The decorators `pass_context` and `pass_obj` are in `click/decorators.py`, and the mechanism for tracking the current context is in `click/globals.py`.
257: 
258: ## Conclusion
259: 
260: The `Context` (`ctx`) is a cornerstone concept in Click, acting as the runtime carrier of information for a command invocation.
261: 
262: You've learned:
263: 
264: *   The Context holds data like the current command, parameters, parent context, and shared application objects (`ctx.obj`).
265: *   The `@click.pass_context` decorator injects the current Context into your command function.
266: *   `ctx.obj` is essential for sharing state between nested commands.
267: *   `ctx.invoke()` and `ctx.forward()` allow commands to call each other programmatically.
268: *   Click uses the context for resource management (`ctx.call_on_close`), ensuring cleanup.
269: 
270: Understanding the Context is key to building more complex Click applications where commands need to interact with each other or with shared application state. It provides the structure and communication channels necessary for sophisticated CLI tools.
271: 
272: So far, we've focused on the logic and structure of commands. But how can we make the interaction in the terminal itself more engaging? How do we prompt users for input, show progress bars, or display colored output? Let's explore Click's terminal UI capabilities next!

  8: # Chapter 6: Term UI (Terminal User Interface)
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 5: Context](05_context.md), we learned how Click uses the `Context` object (`ctx`) to manage the state of a command while it's running, allowing us to share information and call other commands.
 11: 
 12: So far, our commands have mostly just printed simple text. But what if we want to make our command-line tools more interactive and user-friendly? How can we:
 13: 
 14: *   Ask the user for input (like their name or a filename)?
 15: *   Ask simple yes/no questions?
 16: *   Show a progress bar for long-running tasks?
 17: *   Make our output more visually appealing with colors or styles (like making errors red)?
 18: 
 19: This is where Click's **Terminal User Interface (Term UI)** functions come in handy. They are Click's toolkit for talking *back and forth* with the user through the terminal.
 20: 
 21: ## Making Our Tools Talk: The Need for Term UI
 22: 
 23: Imagine you're building a tool that processes a large data file. A purely silent tool isn't very helpful. A better tool might:
 24: 
 25: 1.  Ask the user which file to process.
 26: 2.  Ask for confirmation before starting a potentially long operation.
 27: 3.  Show a progress bar while processing the data.
 28: 4.  Print a nice, colored "Success!" message at the end, or a red "Error!" message if something went wrong.
 29: 
 30: Doing all this reliably across different operating systems (like Linux, macOS, and Windows) can be tricky. For example, getting colored text to work correctly on Windows requires special handling.
 31: 
 32: Click's Term UI functions wrap up these common interactive tasks into easy-to-use functions that work consistently everywhere. Let's explore some of the most useful ones!
 33: 
 34: ## Printing with `click.echo()`
 35: 
 36: We've seen `print()` in Python, but Click provides its own version: `click.echo()`. Why use it?
 37: 
 38: *   **Smarter:** It works better with different kinds of data (like Unicode text and raw bytes).
 39: *   **Cross-Platform:** It handles subtle differences between operating systems for you.
 40: *   **Color Aware:** It automatically strips out color codes if the output isn't going to a terminal (like if you redirect output to a file), preventing garbled text.
 41: *   **Integrated:** It works seamlessly with Click's other features, like redirecting output or testing.
 42: 
 43: Using it is just like `print()`:
 44: 
 45: ```python
 46: # echo_example.py
 47: import click
 48: 
 49: @click.command()
 50: def cli():
 51:   """Demonstrates click.echo"""
 52:   click.echo("Hello from Click!")
 53:   # You can print errors to stderr easily
 54:   click.echo("Oops, something went wrong!", err=True)
 55: 
 56: if __name__ == '__main__':
 57:   cli()
 58: ```
 59: 
 60: Running this:
 61: 
 62: ```bash
 63: $ python echo_example.py
 64: Hello from Click!
 65: Oops, something went wrong!  # (This line goes to stderr)
 66: ```
 67: 
 68: Simple! For most printing in Click apps, `click.echo()` is preferred over `print()`.
 69: 
 70: ## Adding Style: `click.style()` and `click.secho()`
 71: 
 72: Want to make your output stand out? Click makes it easy to add colors and styles (like bold or underline) to your text.
 73: 
 74: *   `click.style(text, fg='color', bg='color', bold=True, ...)`: Takes your text and wraps it with special codes that terminals understand to change its appearance. It returns the modified string.
 75: *   `click.secho(text, fg='color', ...)`: A shortcut that combines `style` and `echo`. It styles the text *and* prints it in one go.
 76: 
 77: Let's make our success and error messages more obvious:
 78: 
 79: ```python
 80: # style_example.py
 81: import click
 82: 
 83: @click.command()
 84: def cli():
 85:   """Demonstrates styled output"""
 86:   # Style the text first, then echo it
 87:   success_message = click.style("Operation successful!", fg='green', bold=True)
 88:   click.echo(success_message)
 89: 
 90:   # Or use secho for style + echo in one step
 91:   click.secho("Critical error!", fg='red', underline=True, err=True)
 92: 
 93: if __name__ == '__main__':
 94:   cli()
 95: ```
 96: 
 97: Running this (your terminal must support color):
 98: 
 99: ```bash
100: $ python style_example.py
101: # Output will look something like:
102: # Operation successful!  (in bold green)
103: # Critical error!        (in underlined red, sent to stderr)
104: ```
105: 
106: Click supports various colors (`'red'`, `'green'`, `'blue'`, etc.) and styles (`bold`, `underline`, `blink`, `reverse`). This makes your CLI output much more informative at a glance!
107: 
108: ## Getting User Input: `click.prompt()`
109: 
110: Sometimes you need to ask the user for information. `click.prompt()` is designed for this. It shows a message and waits for the user to type something and press Enter.
111: 
112: ```python
113: # prompt_example.py
114: import click
115: 
116: @click.command()
117: def cli():
118:   """Asks for user input"""
119:   name = click.prompt("Please enter your name")
120:   click.echo(f"Hello, {name}!")
121: 
122:   # You can specify a default value
123:   location = click.prompt("Enter location", default="Earth")
124:   click.echo(f"Location: {location}")
125: 
126:   # You can also require a specific type (like an integer)
127:   age = click.prompt("Enter your age", type=int)
128:   click.echo(f"You are {age} years old.")
129: 
130: if __name__ == '__main__':
131:   cli()
132: ```
133: 
134: Running this interactively:
135: 
136: ```bash
137: $ python prompt_example.py
138: Please enter your name: Alice
139: Hello, Alice!
140: Enter location [Earth]: # Just press Enter here
141: Location: Earth
142: Enter your age: 30
143: You are 30 years old.
144: ```
145: 
146: If you enter something that can't be converted to the `type` (like "abc" for age), `click.prompt` will automatically show an error and ask again! It can also hide input for passwords (`hide_input=True`).
147: 
148: ## Asking Yes/No: `click.confirm()`
149: 
150: A common need is asking for confirmation before doing something potentially destructive or time-consuming. `click.confirm()` handles this nicely.
151: 
152: ```python
153: # confirm_example.py
154: import click
155: import time
156: 
157: @click.command()
158: @click.option('--yes', is_flag=True, help='Assume Yes to confirmation.')
159: def cli(yes):
160:   """Asks for confirmation."""
161:   click.echo("This might take a while or change things.")
162: 
163:   # If --yes flag is given, `yes` is True, otherwise ask.
164:   # abort=True means if user says No, stop the program.
165:   if not yes:
166:     click.confirm("Do you want to continue?", abort=True)
167: 
168:   click.echo("Starting operation...")
169:   time.sleep(2) # Simulate work
170:   click.echo("Done!")
171: 
172: if __name__ == '__main__':
173:   cli()
174: ```
175: 
176: Running interactively:
177: 
178: ```bash
179: $ python confirm_example.py
180: This might take a while or change things.
181: Do you want to continue? [y/N]: y # User types 'y'
182: Starting operation...
183: Done!
184: ```
185: 
186: If the user types 'n' (or just presses Enter, since the default is No - indicated by `[y/N]`), the program will stop immediately because of `abort=True`. If you run `python confirm_example.py --yes`, it skips the question entirely.
187: 
188: ## Showing Progress: `click.progressbar()`
189: 
190: For tasks that take a while, it's good practice to show the user that something is happening. `click.progressbar()` creates a visual progress bar. You typically use it with a Python `with` statement around a loop.
191: 
192: Let's simulate processing a list of items:
193: 
194: ```python
195: # progress_example.py
196: import click
197: import time
198: 
199: items_to_process = range(100) # Simulate 100 items
200: 
201: @click.command()
202: def cli():
203:   """Shows a progress bar."""
204:   # 'items_to_process' is the iterable
205:   # 'label' is the text shown before the bar
206:   with click.progressbar(items_to_process, label="Processing items") as bar:
207:     for item in bar:
208:       # Simulate work for each item
209:       time.sleep(0.05)
210:       # The 'bar' automatically updates with each iteration
211: 
212:   click.echo("Finished processing!")
213: 
214: if __name__ == '__main__':
215:   cli()
216: ```
217: 
218: When you run this, you'll see a progress bar update in your terminal:
219: 
220: ```bash
221: $ python progress_example.py
222: Processing items  [####################################]  100%  00:00:05
223: Finished processing!
224: # (The bar animates in place while running)
225: ```
226: 
227: The progress bar automatically figures out the percentage and estimated time remaining (ETA). It makes long tasks much less mysterious for the user. You can also use it without an iterable by manually calling the `bar.update(increment)` method inside the `with` block.
228: 
229: ## How Term UI Works Under the Hood
230: 
231: These functions seem simple, but they handle quite a bit behind the scenes:
232: 
233: 1.  **Abstraction:** They provide a high-level API for common terminal tasks, hiding the low-level details.
234: 2.  **Input Handling:** Functions like `prompt` and `confirm` use Python's built-in `input()` or `getpass.getpass()` (for hidden input). They add loops for retries, default value handling, and type conversion/validation (using [ParamType](04_paramtype.md) concepts internally).
235: 3.  **Output Handling (`echo`, `secho`):**
236:     *   They check if the output stream (`stdout` or `stderr`) is connected to a terminal (`isatty`).
237:     *   If not a terminal, or if color is disabled, `style` codes are automatically removed (`strip_ansi`).
238:     *   On Windows, if `colorama` is installed, Click wraps the output streams to translate ANSI color codes into Windows API calls, making colors work automatically.
239: 4.  **Progress Bar (`progressbar`):**
240:     *   It calculates the percentage complete based on the iterable's length (or the provided `length`).
241:     *   It estimates the remaining time (ETA) by timing recent iterations.
242:     *   It formats the bar (`#` and `-` characters) and info text.
243:     *   Crucially, it uses special terminal control characters (like `\r` - carriage return) to move the cursor back to the beginning of the line before printing the updated bar. This makes the bar *appear* to update in place rather than printing many lines. It also hides/shows the cursor during updates (`\033[?25l`, `\033[?25h`) on non-Windows systems for a smoother look.
244: 5.  **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** A major goal is to make these interactions work consistently across different operating systems and terminal types, handling quirks like Windows console limitations (`_winconsole.py`, `_compat.py`).
245: 
246: Let's visualize what might happen when you call `click.secho("Error!", fg='red', err=True)`:
247: 
248: ```mermaid
249: sequenceDiagram
250:     participant UserCode as Your Code
251:     participant ClickSecho as click.secho()
252:     participant ClickStyle as click.style()
253:     participant ClickEcho as click.echo()
254:     participant CompatLayer as Click Compatibility Layer
255:     participant Terminal
256: 
257:     UserCode->>ClickSecho: secho("Error!", fg='red', err=True)
258:     ClickSecho->>ClickStyle: style("Error!", fg='red', ...)
259:     ClickStyle-->>ClickSecho: Returns "\033[31mError!\033[0m" (styled text)
260:     ClickSecho->>ClickEcho: echo("\033[31mError!\033[0m", err=True)
261:     ClickEcho->>CompatLayer: Check if output (stderr) is a TTY
262:     CompatLayer-->>ClickEcho: Yes, it's a TTY
263:     ClickEcho->>CompatLayer: Check if color is enabled
264:     CompatLayer-->>ClickEcho: Yes, color is enabled
265:     Note over ClickEcho, Terminal: On Windows, may wrap stream with Colorama here
266:     ClickEcho->>CompatLayer: Write styled text to stderr
267:     CompatLayer->>Terminal: Writes "\033[31mError!\033[0m\n"
268:     Terminal-->>Terminal: Displays "Error!" in red
269: ```
270: 
271: The key is that Click adds layers of checks and formatting (`style`, color stripping, platform adaptation) around the basic act of printing (`echo`) or getting input (`prompt`).
272: 
273: You can find the implementation details in:
274: *   `click/termui.py`: Defines the main functions like `prompt`, `confirm`, `style`, `secho`, `progressbar`, `echo_via_pager`.
275: *   `click/_termui_impl.py`: Contains the implementations for more complex features like `ProgressBar`, `Editor`, `pager`, and `getchar`.
276: *   `click/utils.py`: Contains `echo` and helpers like `open_stream`.
277: *   `click/_compat.py` & `click/_winconsole.py`: Handle differences between Python versions and operating systems, especially for terminal I/O and color support on Windows.
278: 
279: ## Conclusion
280: 
281: Click's **Term UI** functions are essential for creating command-line applications that are interactive, informative, and pleasant to use. You've learned how to:
282: 
283: *   Print output reliably with `click.echo`.
284: *   Add visual flair with colors and styles using `click.style` and `click.secho`.
285: *   Ask the user for input with `click.prompt`.
286: *   Get yes/no confirmation using `click.confirm`.
287: *   Show progress for long tasks with `click.progressbar`.
288: 
289: These tools handle many cross-platform complexities, letting you focus on building the core logic of your interactive CLI.
290: 
291: But what happens when things go wrong? How does Click handle errors, like invalid user input or missing files? That's where Click's exception handling comes in. Let's dive into that next!

  8: # Chapter 7: Click Exceptions - Handling Errors Gracefully
  9: 
 10: In the last chapter, [Chapter 6: Term UI (Terminal User Interface)](06_term_ui__terminal_user_interface_.md), we explored how to make our command-line tools interactive and visually appealing using functions like `click.prompt`, `click.confirm`, and `click.secho`. We learned how to communicate effectively *with* the user.
 11: 
 12: But what happens when the user doesn't communicate effectively with *us*? What if they type the wrong command, forget a required argument, or enter text when a number was expected? Our programs need a way to handle these errors without just crashing.
 13: 
 14: This is where **Click Exceptions** come in. They are Click's way of signaling that something went wrong, usually because of a problem with the user's input or how they tried to run the command.
 15: 
 16: ## Why Special Exceptions? The Problem with Crashes
 17: 
 18: Imagine you have a command that needs a number, like `--count 5`. You used `type=click.INT` like we learned in [Chapter 4: ParamType](04_paramtype.md). What happens if the user types `--count five`?
 19: 
 20: If Click didn't handle this specially, the `int("five")` conversion inside Click would fail, raising a standard Python `ValueError`. This might cause your program to stop with a long, confusing Python traceback message that isn't very helpful for the end-user. They might not understand what went wrong or how to fix it.
 21: 
 22: Click wants to provide a better experience. When something like this happens, Click catches the internal error and raises one of its own **custom exception types**. These special exceptions tell Click exactly what kind of problem occurred (e.g., bad input, missing argument).
 23: 
 24: ## Meet the Click Exceptions
 25: 
 26: Click has a family of exception classes designed specifically for handling command-line errors. The most important ones inherit from the base class `click.ClickException`. Here are some common ones you'll encounter (or use):
 27: 
 28: *   `ClickException`: The base for all Click-handled errors.
 29: *   `UsageError`: A general error indicating the command was used incorrectly (e.g., wrong number of arguments). It usually prints the command's usage instructions.
 30: *   `BadParameter`: Raised when the value provided for an option or argument is invalid (e.g., "five" for an integer type, or a value not in a `click.Choice`).
 31: *   `MissingParameter`: Raised when a required option or argument is not provided.
 32: *   `NoSuchOption`: Raised when the user tries to use an option that doesn't exist (e.g., `--verrbose` instead of `--verbose`).
 33: *   `FileError`: Raised by `click.File` or `click.Path` if a file can't be opened or accessed correctly.
 34: *   `Abort`: A special exception you can raise to stop execution immediately (like after a failed `click.confirm`).
 35: 
 36: **The Magic:** The really neat part is that Click's main command processing logic is designed to *catch* these specific exceptions. When it catches one, it doesn't just crash. Instead, it:
 37: 
 38: 1.  **Formats a helpful error message:** Often using information from the exception itself (like which parameter was bad).
 39: 2.  **Prints the message** (usually prefixed with "Error:") to the standard error stream (`stderr`).
 40: 3.  **Often shows relevant help text** (like the command's usage synopsis).
 41: 4.  **Exits the application cleanly** with a non-zero exit code (signaling to the system that an error occurred).
 42: 
 43: This gives the user clear feedback about what they did wrong and how to potentially fix it, without seeing scary Python tracebacks.
 44: 
 45: ## Seeing Exceptions in Action (Automatically)
 46: 
 47: You've already seen Click exceptions working! Remember our `count_app.py` from [Chapter 4: ParamType](04_paramtype.md)?
 48: 
 49: ```python
 50: # count_app.py (from Chapter 4)
 51: import click
 52: 
 53: @click.command()
 54: @click.option('--count', default=1, type=click.INT, help='Number of times to print.')
 55: @click.argument('message')
 56: def repeat(count, message):
 57:   """Prints MESSAGE the specified number of times."""
 58:   for _ in range(count):
 59:     click.echo(message)
 60: 
 61: if __name__ == '__main__':
 62:   repeat()
 63: ```
 64: 
 65: If you run this with invalid input for `--count`:
 66: 
 67: ```bash
 68: $ python count_app.py --count five "Oh no"
 69: Usage: count_app.py [OPTIONS] MESSAGE
 70: Try 'count_app.py --help' for help.
 71: 
 72: Error: Invalid value for '--count': 'five' is not a valid integer.
 73: ```
 74: 
 75: That clear "Error: Invalid value for '--count': 'five' is not a valid integer." message? That's Click catching a `BadParameter` exception (raised internally by `click.INT.convert`) and showing it nicely!
 76: 
 77: What if you forget the required `MESSAGE` argument?
 78: 
 79: ```bash
 80: $ python count_app.py --count 3
 81: Usage: count_app.py [OPTIONS] MESSAGE
 82: Try 'count_app.py --help' for help.
 83: 
 84: Error: Missing argument 'MESSAGE'.
 85: ```
 86: 
 87: Again, a clear error message! This time, Click caught a `MissingParameter` exception.
 88: 
 89: ## Raising Exceptions Yourself: Custom Validation
 90: 
 91: Click raises exceptions automatically for many common errors. But sometimes, you have validation logic that's specific to your application. For example, maybe an `--age` option must be positive.
 92: 
 93: The standard way to report these custom validation errors is to **raise a `click.BadParameter` exception** yourself, usually from within a callback function.
 94: 
 95: Let's add a callback to our `count_app.py` to ensure `count` is positive.
 96: 
 97: ```python
 98: # count_app_validate.py
 99: import click
100: 
101: # 1. Define a validation callback function
102: def validate_count(ctx, param, value):
103:   """Callback to ensure count is positive."""
104:   if value <= 0:
105:     # 2. Raise BadParameter if validation fails
106:     raise click.BadParameter("Count must be a positive number.")
107:   # 3. Return the value if it's valid
108:   return value
109: 
110: @click.command()
111: # 4. Attach the callback to the --count option
112: @click.option('--count', default=1, type=click.INT, help='Number of times to print.',
113:               callback=validate_count) # <-- Added callback
114: @click.argument('message')
115: def repeat(count, message):
116:   """Prints MESSAGE the specified number of times (must be positive)."""
117:   for _ in range(count):
118:     click.echo(message)
119: 
120: if __name__ == '__main__':
121:   repeat()
122: ```
123: 
124: Let's break down the changes:
125: 
126: 1.  `def validate_count(ctx, param, value):`: We defined a function that takes the [Context](05_context.md), the [Parameter](03_parameter__option___argument_.md) object, and the *already type-converted* value.
127: 2.  `raise click.BadParameter(...)`: If the `value` (which we know is an `int` thanks to `type=click.INT`) is not positive, we raise `click.BadParameter` with our custom error message.
128: 3.  `return value`: If the value is valid, the callback **must** return it.
129: 4.  `callback=validate_count`: We told the `--count` option to use our `validate_count` function after type conversion.
130: 
131: **Run it with invalid input:**
132: 
133: ```bash
134: $ python count_app_validate.py --count 0 "Zero?"
135: Usage: count_app_validate.py [OPTIONS] MESSAGE
136: Try 'count_app_validate.py --help' for help.
137: 
138: Error: Invalid value for '--count': Count must be a positive number.
139: 
140: $ python count_app_validate.py --count -5 "Negative?"
141: Usage: count_app_validate.py [OPTIONS] MESSAGE
142: Try 'count_app_validate.py --help' for help.
143: 
144: Error: Invalid value for '--count': Count must be a positive number.
145: ```
146: 
147: It works! Our custom validation logic triggered, we raised `click.BadParameter`, and Click caught it, displaying our specific error message cleanly. This is the standard way to integrate your own validation rules into Click's error handling.
148: 
149: ## How Click Handles Exceptions (Under the Hood)
150: 
151: What exactly happens when a Click exception is raised, either by Click itself or by your code?
152: 
153: 1.  **Raise:** An operation fails (like type conversion, parsing finding a missing argument, or your custom callback). A specific `ClickException` subclass (e.g., `BadParameter`, `MissingParameter`) is instantiated and raised.
154: 2.  **Catch:** Click's main application runner (usually triggered when you call your top-level `cli()` function) has a `try...except ClickException` block around the command execution logic.
155: 3.  **Show:** When a `ClickException` is caught, the runner calls the exception object's `show()` method.
156: 4.  **Format & Print:** The `show()` method (defined in `exceptions.py` for each exception type) formats the error message.
157:     *   `UsageError` (and its subclasses like `BadParameter`, `MissingParameter`, `NoSuchOption`) typically includes the command's usage string (`ctx.get_usage()`) and a hint to try the `--help` option.
158:     *   `BadParameter` adds context like "Invalid value for 'PARAMETER_NAME':".
159:     *   `MissingParameter` formats "Missing argument/option 'PARAMETER_NAME'.".
160:     *   The formatted message is printed to `stderr` using `click.echo()`, respecting color settings from the context.
161: 5.  **Exit:** After showing the message, Click calls `sys.exit()` with the exception's `exit_code` (usually `1` for general errors, `2` for usage errors). This terminates the program and signals the error status to the calling shell or script.
162: 
163: Here's a simplified sequence diagram for the `BadParameter` case when a user provides invalid input that fails type conversion:
164: 
165: ```mermaid
166: sequenceDiagram
167:     participant User
168:     participant CLI as YourApp.py
169:     participant ClickRuntime
170:     participant ParamType as ParamType (e.g., click.INT)
171:     participant ClickExceptionHandling
172: 
173:     User->>CLI: python YourApp.py --count five
174:     CLI->>ClickRuntime: Starts command execution
175:     ClickRuntime->>ParamType: Calls convert(value='five', ...) for '--count'
176:     ParamType->>ParamType: Tries int('five'), raises ValueError
177:     ParamType->>ClickExceptionHandling: Catches ValueError, calls self.fail(...)
178:     ClickExceptionHandling->>ClickExceptionHandling: Raises BadParameter("...'five' is not...")
179:     ClickExceptionHandling-->>ClickRuntime: BadParameter propagates up
180:     ClickRuntime->>ClickExceptionHandling: Catches BadParameter exception
181:     ClickExceptionHandling->>ClickExceptionHandling: Calls exception.show()
182:     ClickExceptionHandling->>CLI: Prints formatted "Error: Invalid value..." to stderr
183:     ClickExceptionHandling->>CLI: Calls sys.exit(exception.exit_code)
184:     CLI-->>User: Shows error message and exits
185: ```
186: 
187: The core exception classes are defined in `click/exceptions.py`. You can see how `ClickException` defines the basic `show` method and `exit_code`, and how subclasses like `UsageError` and `BadParameter` override `format_message` to provide more specific output based on the context (`ctx`) and parameter (`param`) they might hold.
188: 
189: ```python
190: # Simplified structure from click/exceptions.py
191: 
192: class ClickException(Exception):
193:     exit_code = 1
194: 
195:     def __init__(self, message: str) -> None:
196:         # ... (stores message, gets color settings) ...
197:         self.message = message
198: 
199:     def format_message(self) -> str:
200:         return self.message
201: 
202:     def show(self, file=None) -> None:
203:         # ... (gets stderr if file is None) ...
204:         echo(f"Error: {self.format_message()}", file=file, color=self.show_color)
205: 
206: class UsageError(ClickException):
207:     exit_code = 2
208: 
209:     def __init__(self, message: str, ctx=None) -> None:
210:         super().__init__(message)
211:         self.ctx = ctx
212:         # ...
213: 
214:     def show(self, file=None) -> None:
215:         # ... (gets stderr, color) ...
216:         hint = ""
217:         if self.ctx is not None and self.ctx.command.get_help_option(self.ctx):
218:             hint = f"Try '{self.ctx.command_path} {self.ctx.help_option_names[0]}' for help.\n"
219:         if self.ctx is not None:
220:             echo(f"{self.ctx.get_usage()}\n{hint}", file=file, color=color)
221:         # Call the base class's logic to print "Error: ..."
222:         echo(f"Error: {self.format_message()}", file=file, color=color)
223: 
224: class BadParameter(UsageError):
225:     def __init__(self, message: str, ctx=None, param=None, param_hint=None) -> None:
226:         super().__init__(message, ctx)
227:         self.param = param
228:         self.param_hint = param_hint
229: 
230:     def format_message(self) -> str:
231:         # ... (logic to get parameter name/hint) ...
232:         param_hint = self.param.get_error_hint(self.ctx) if self.param else self.param_hint
233:         # ...
234:         return f"Invalid value for {param_hint}: {self.message}"
235: 
236: # Other exceptions like MissingParameter, NoSuchOption follow similar patterns
237: ```
238: 
239: By using this structured exception system, Click ensures that user errors are reported consistently and helpfully across any Click application.
240: 
241: ## Conclusion
242: 
243: Click Exceptions are the standard mechanism for reporting errors related to command usage and user input within Click applications.
244: 
245: You've learned:
246: 
247: *   Click uses custom exceptions like `UsageError`, `BadParameter`, and `MissingParameter` to signal specific problems.
248: *   Click catches these exceptions automatically to display user-friendly error messages, usage hints, and exit cleanly.
249: *   You can (and should) raise exceptions like `click.BadParameter` in your own validation callbacks to report custom errors in a standard way.
250: *   This system prevents confusing Python tracebacks and provides helpful feedback to the user.
251: 
252: Understanding and using Click's exception hierarchy is key to building robust and user-friendly command-line interfaces that handle problems gracefully.
253: 
254: This concludes our journey through the core concepts of Click! We've covered everything from basic [Commands and Groups](01_command___group.md), [Decorators](02_decorators.md), [Parameters](03_parameter__option___argument_.md), and [Types](04_paramtype.md), to managing runtime state with the [Context](05_context.md), creating interactive [Terminal UIs](06_term_ui__terminal_user_interface_.md), and handling errors with [Click Exceptions](07_click_exceptions.md). Armed with this knowledge, you're well-equipped to start building your own powerful and elegant command-line tools with Click!

12: Click<sup>[View Repo](https://github.com/pallets/click/tree/main/src/click)</sup> is a Python library that makes creating **command-line interfaces (CLIs)** *easy and fun*.
13: It uses simple Python **decorators** (`@click.command`, `@click.option`, etc.) to turn your functions into CLI commands with options and arguments.
14: Click handles parsing user input, generating help messages, validating data types, and managing the flow between commands, letting you focus on your application's logic.
15: It also provides tools for *terminal interactions* like prompting users and showing progress bars.

  8: # Chapter 1: Terminal UI (Ink Components)
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the Codex tutorial! We're excited to have you explore how Codex works under the hood. This first chapter dives into how Codex creates its chat interface right inside your terminal window.
 11: 
 12: ## What's the Big Idea?
 13: 
 14: Imagine you want `Codex` to write a simple script. You type something like `codex "write a python script that prints hello world"` into your terminal. How does Codex show you the conversation – your request, its response, maybe questions it asks, or commands it suggests running – all without opening a separate window? And how do you type your next message?
 15: 
 16: That's where the **Terminal UI** comes in. It's the system responsible for drawing the entire chat interface you see and interact with directly in your command line.
 17: 
 18: Think of it like the dashboard and controls of a car:
 19: 
 20: *   **Dashboard:** Displays information (like the chat history, AI messages, loading indicators).
 21: *   **Controls (Steering Wheel, Pedals):** Let you interact (like the input field where you type messages, or menus to approve commands).
 22: 
 23: Just like the car's dashboard lets you see what the engine is doing and control it, the Terminal UI lets you see what the core `Codex` logic (the [Agent Loop](03_agent_loop.md)) is doing and provide input to it.
 24: 
 25: ## Key Concepts: Ink & React
 26: 
 27: How does Codex build this terminal interface? It uses two main technologies:
 28: 
 29: 1.  **Ink:** This is a fantastic library that lets developers build command-line interfaces using **React**. If you know React for web development, Ink feels very similar, but instead of rendering buttons and divs in a browser, it renders text, boxes, and lists in your terminal.
 30: 
 31: 2.  **React Components:** The UI is broken down into reusable pieces called React components. We have components for:
 32:     *   Displaying individual messages (`TerminalChatResponseItem`).
 33:     *   Showing the whole conversation history (`MessageHistory`).
 34:     *   The text box where you type your input (`TerminalChatInput` / `TerminalChatNewInput`).
 35:     *   Prompts asking you to approve commands (`TerminalChatCommandReview`).
 36:     *   Spinners to show when Codex is thinking.
 37: 
 38: These components work together, managed by React, to create the dynamic interface you see.
 39: 
 40: ## How You See It: Rendering the Chat
 41: 
 42: When you run `Codex`, the main application component (`App` in `app.tsx`) kicks things off. It might first check if you're in a safe directory (like a Git repository) and ask for confirmation if not.
 43: 
 44: ```tsx
 45: // File: codex-cli/src/app.tsx (Simplified)
 46: 
 47: // ... imports ...
 48: import TerminalChat from "./components/chat/terminal-chat";
 49: import { ConfirmInput } from "@inkjs/ui";
 50: import { Box, Text, useApp } from "ink";
 51: import React, { useState } from "react";
 52: 
 53: export default function App({ /* ...props... */ }): JSX.Element {
 54:   const app = useApp();
 55:   const [accepted, setAccepted] = useState(/* ... */);
 56:   const inGitRepo = /* ... check if in git ... */;
 57: 
 58:   // If not in a git repo and not yet accepted, show a warning
 59:   if (!inGitRepo && !accepted) {
 60:     return (
 61:       <Box flexDirection="column" /* ...styling... */>
 62:         <Text color="yellow">Warning! Not in a git repo.</Text>
 63:         <ConfirmInput // <-- An Ink component for Yes/No!
 64:           onConfirm={() => setAccepted(true)}
 65:           onCancel={() => app.exit()}
 66:         />
 67:       </Box>
 68:     );
 69:   }
 70: 
 71:   // Otherwise, render the main chat interface
 72:   return <TerminalChat /* ...props... */ />;
 73: }
 74: ```
 75: 
 76: This snippet shows how the `App` component uses Ink's `<Box>`, `<Text>`, and even interactive components like `<ConfirmInput>`. If the safety check passes, it renders the core `<TerminalChat>` component.
 77: 
 78: The `<TerminalChat>` component (`terminal-chat.tsx`) is the main hub for the chat UI. It manages the state, like the list of messages (`items`), whether the AI is currently working (`loading`), and any command confirmations needed (`confirmationPrompt`).
 79: 
 80: ```tsx
 81: // File: codex-cli/src/components/chat/terminal-chat.tsx (Simplified)
 82: 
 83: // ... imports ...
 84: import TerminalMessageHistory from "./terminal-message-history";
 85: import TerminalChatInput from "./terminal-chat-input"; // Or TerminalChatNewInput
 86: import { Box } from "ink";
 87: import React, { useState } from "react";
 88: 
 89: export default function TerminalChat({ /* ...props... */ }): React.ReactElement {
 90:   const [items, setItems] = useState<Array<ResponseItem>>([]); // Holds all messages
 91:   const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false); // Is the AI busy?
 92:   const [confirmationPrompt, setConfirmationPrompt] = useState<React.ReactNode | null>(null); // Command to review?
 93:   // ... other state and logic ...
 94: 
 95:   return (
 96:     <Box flexDirection="column">
 97:       {/* Display the conversation history */}
 98:       <TerminalMessageHistory
 99:         batch={/* ...derived from items... */}
100:         loading={loading}
101:         /* ...other props... */
102:       />
103: 
104:       {/* Display the input box or the command review prompt */}
105:       <TerminalChatInput // Or TerminalChatNewInput
106:         loading={loading}
107:         confirmationPrompt={confirmationPrompt}
108:         submitInput={(/*...user input...*/) => { /* Send to Agent Loop */ }}
109:         submitConfirmation={(/*...decision...*/) => { /* Send to Agent Loop */ }}
110:         /* ...other props... */
111:       />
112:     </Box>
113:   );
114: }
115: ```
116: 
117: *   `<TerminalMessageHistory>` takes the list of `items` (messages) and renders them.
118: *   `<TerminalChatInput>` (or its multiline sibling `<TerminalChatNewInput>`) displays the input box when `loading` is false and there's no `confirmationPrompt`. If there *is* a `confirmationPrompt`, it shows the command review UI instead.
119: 
120: ### Showing Messages
121: 
122: How does `<TerminalMessageHistory>` actually display the messages? It uses a special Ink component called `<Static>` for efficiency and maps each message `item` to a `<TerminalChatResponseItem>`.
123: 
124: ```tsx
125: // File: codex-cli/src/components/chat/terminal-message-history.tsx (Simplified)
126: 
127: // ... imports ...
128: import TerminalChatResponseItem from "./terminal-chat-response-item";
129: import { Box, Static } from "ink";
130: import React from "react";
131: 
132: const MessageHistory: React.FC<MessageHistoryProps> = ({ batch, /* ... */ }) => {
133:   // Extract the actual message objects
134:   const messages = batch.map(({ item }) => item!);
135: 
136:   return (
137:     <Box flexDirection="column">
138:       {/* <Static> renders past items efficiently */}
139:       <Static items={messages}>
140:         {(message, index) => (
141:           // Render each message using TerminalChatResponseItem
142:           <Box key={`${message.id}-${index}`} /* ...styling... */ >
143:             <TerminalChatResponseItem item={message} />
144:           </Box>
145:         )}
146:       </Static>
147:     </Box>
148:   );
149: };
150: 
151: export default React.memo(MessageHistory);
152: ```
153: 
154: `<Static>` tells Ink that these items won't change often, allowing Ink to optimize rendering. Each message is passed to `<TerminalChatResponseItem>`.
155: 
156: Inside `TerminalChatResponseItem` (`terminal-chat-response-item.tsx`), we figure out what *kind* of message it is (user message, AI response, command output, etc.) and render it accordingly using Ink's basic `<Text>` and `<Box>` components, sometimes with helpers like `<Markdown>` for formatting.
157: 
158: ```tsx
159: // File: codex-cli/src/components/chat/terminal-chat-response-item.tsx (Simplified)
160: 
161: // ... imports ...
162: import { Box, Text } from "ink";
163: import React from "react";
164: // ... other components like Markdown ...
165: 
166: export default function TerminalChatResponseItem({ item }: { item: ResponseItem }): React.ReactElement {
167:   switch (item.type) {
168:     case "message": // User or AI text message
169:       return (
170:         <Box flexDirection="column">
171:           <Text bold color={/* color based on role */}>
172:             {item.role === "assistant" ? "codex" : item.role}
173:           </Text>
174:           {/* Render message content, potentially using Markdown */}
175:           <Text>{/* ... content ... */}</Text>
176:         </Box>
177:       );
178:     case "function_call": // AI wants to run a command
179:        return (
180:          <Box flexDirection="column">
181:            <Text color="magentaBright" bold>command</Text>
182:            <Text><Text dimColor>$</Text> {/* Formatted command */}</Text>
183:          </Box>
184:        );
185:     // ... other cases like function_call_output ...
186:     default:
187:       return <Text>Unknown message type</Text>;
188:   }
189: }
190: ```
191: 
192: ### Getting Your Input
193: 
194: The `<TerminalChatInput>` (or `<TerminalChatNewInput>`) component uses specialized input components (like `<TextInput>` from `ink-text-input` or our custom `<MultilineTextEditor>`) to capture your keystrokes. When you press Enter, it calls the `onSubmit` or `submitInput` function provided by `<TerminalChat>`.
195: 
196: ```tsx
197: // File: codex-cli/src/components/chat/terminal-chat-new-input.tsx (Simplified)
198: 
199: // ... imports ...
200: import MultilineTextEditor from "./multiline-editor"; // Custom multiline input
201: import { Box, Text, useInput } from "ink";
202: import React, { useState } from "react";
203: 
204: export default function TerminalChatInput({ submitInput, active, /* ... */ }): React.ReactElement {
205:   const [input, setInput] = useState(""); // Current text in the editor
206:   const editorRef = React.useRef(/* ... */); // Handle to editor
207: 
208:   // useInput hook from Ink handles key presses (like Up/Down for history)
209:   useInput((_input, _key) => {
210:      // Handle history navigation (Up/Down arrows)
211:      // ... logic using editorRef.current.getRow() ...
212:   }, { isActive: active });
213: 
214:   return (
215:     <Box flexDirection="column">
216:       <Box borderStyle="round">
217:         {/* The actual input field */}
218:         <MultilineTextEditor
219:           ref={editorRef}
220:           onChange={(txt: string) => setInput(txt)}
221:           initialText={input}
222:           focus={active} // Only active when overlay isn't shown
223:           onSubmit={(text) => {
224:             // When Enter is pressed (and not escaped)
225:             submitInput(/* ...create input item from text... */);
226:             setInput(""); // Clear the input field
227:           }}
228:         />
229:       </Box>
230:       {/* Help text */}
231:       <Text dimColor>ctrl+c to exit | enter to send</Text>
232:     </Box>
233:   );
234: }
235: ```
236: 
237: This component manages the text you type and uses Ink's `useInput` hook to handle special keys like arrow keys for command history. The details of text editing are handled in the next chapter: [Input Handling (TextBuffer/Editor)](02_input_handling__textbuffer_editor_.md).
238: 
239: ### Reviewing Commands
240: 
241: If the [Agent Loop](03_agent_loop.md) decides it needs to run a command and requires your approval, `<TerminalChat>` will receive a `confirmationPrompt`. This prompt (which is itself a React element, often `<TerminalChatToolCallCommand>`) is passed down to `<TerminalChatInput>`, which then renders `<TerminalChatCommandReview>` instead of the regular input box.
242: 
243: ```tsx
244: // File: codex-cli/src/components/chat/terminal-chat-command-review.tsx (Simplified)
245: 
246: // ... imports ...
247: // @ts-expect-error - Using a vendor component for selection
248: import { Select } from "../vendor/ink-select/select";
249: import TextInput from "../vendor/ink-text-input"; // For editing feedback
250: import { Box, Text, useInput } from "ink";
251: import React from "react";
252: 
253: export function TerminalChatCommandReview({
254:   confirmationPrompt, // The command display element
255:   onReviewCommand, // Function to call with the decision
256: }: { /* ... */ }): React.ReactElement {
257:   const [mode, setMode] = React.useState<"select" | "input">("select"); // Select Yes/No or type feedback
258: 
259:   // Options for the selection list
260:   const approvalOptions = [
261:     { label: "Yes (y)", value: ReviewDecision.YES },
262:     // ... other options like Always, Edit, No ...
263:   ];
264: 
265:   useInput((input, key) => { /* Handle shortcuts like 'y', 'n', 'e', Esc */ });
266: 
267:   return (
268:     <Box flexDirection="column" borderStyle="round" marginTop={1}>
269:       {/* Display the command that needs review */}
270:       {confirmationPrompt}
271: 
272:       {mode === "select" ? (
273:         <>
274:           <Text>Allow command?</Text>
275:           <Select // Ink component for selection lists
276:             options={approvalOptions}
277:             onChange={(value) => { /* ... call onReviewCommand or setMode('input') ... */ }}
278:           />
279:         </>
280:       ) : (
281:         /* UI for typing feedback (TextInput) */
282:         // ...
283:       )}
284:     </Box>
285:   );
286: }
287: ```
288: 
289: This component shows the command passed in (`confirmationPrompt`), presents options using Ink's `<Select>` component (or a `<TextInput>` if you choose to edit/give feedback), listens for your choice (via keyboard shortcuts or the selection list), and finally calls `onReviewCommand` with your decision.

314: ```
315: 
316: 1.  You run `codex`.
317: 2.  The CLI process starts.
318: 3.  The React application (`App` -> `TerminalChat`) renders the initial UI using Ink components. Ink translates these components into terminal commands to draw the interface.
319: 4.  You type your message into the `<TerminalChatInput>` component.
320: 5.  When you press Enter, the input component's `onSubmit` handler is called.
321: 6.  `<TerminalChat>` receives this, packages it, and calls the `run` method on the [Agent Loop](03_agent_loop.md).
322: 7.  The Agent Loop processes the input (often calling an LLM).
323: 8.  When the Agent Loop has something to display (like the AI's text response), it calls the `onItem` callback function provided by `<TerminalChat>`.
324: 9.  `<TerminalChat>` receives the new message item and updates its `items` state using `setItems`.
325: 10. React detects the state change and tells Ink to re-render the necessary components (like adding the new message to `<TerminalMessageHistory>`).
326: 11. Ink updates the terminal display.
327: 
328: The process for handling command confirmations is similar, involving the `getCommandConfirmation` and `submitConfirmation` callbacks between `<TerminalChat>` and the Agent Loop, rendering `<TerminalChatCommandReview>` in the UI when needed.
329: 
330: ## Conclusion
331: 
332: You've now seen how Codex uses the power of React and the Ink library to build a fully interactive chat interface directly within your terminal. This "Terminal UI" layer acts as the visual front-end, displaying messages, capturing your input, and presenting choices like command approvals, all while coordinating with the core [Agent Loop](03_agent_loop.md) behind the scenes.
333: 
334: But how exactly does that input box capture your keystrokes, handle multi-line editing, and manage command history? We'll explore that in the next chapter.

  8: # Chapter 2: Input Handling (TextBuffer/Editor)
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](01_terminal_ui__ink_components_.md), we saw how Codex uses Ink and React to draw the chat interface in your terminal. We learned about components like `<TerminalChatInput>` and `<MultilineTextEditor>` that show an input box. But how does that input box *actually work*?
 11: 
 12: ## Why a Fancy Input Box?
 13: 
 14: Imagine you want Codex to write a small Python script. You might type something like this:
 15: 
 16: ```python
 17: Write a python function that:
 18: 1. Takes a list of numbers.
 19: 2. Returns a new list containing only the even numbers.
 20: Make sure it handles empty lists gracefully.
 21: ```
 22: 
 23: Or maybe you're reviewing a command Codex proposed and want to give detailed feedback. A simple, single-line input field like your shell's basic prompt would be really awkward for this! You'd want to:
 24: 
 25: *   Write multiple lines easily.
 26: *   Use arrow keys to move your cursor around to fix typos.
 27: *   Maybe jump back a whole word (`Ctrl+LeftArrow`) or delete a word (`Ctrl+Backspace`).
 28: *   Press `Up` or `Down` arrow to bring back previous messages you sent (history).
 29: *   Perhaps even open the current text in your main code editor (like VS Code or Vim) for complex edits (`Ctrl+X`).
 30: 
 31: This is where the **Input Handling** system comes in. It's like a mini text editor built right into the Codex chat interface, designed to make typing potentially complex prompts and messages much easier than a standard terminal input line.
 32: 
 33: ## Key Idea: The `TextBuffer`
 34: 
 35: The heart of this system is a class called `TextBuffer` (found in `text-buffer.ts`). Think of `TextBuffer` like the hidden document model behind a simple text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit):
 36: 
 37: *   **It holds the text:** It stores all the lines of text you've typed into the input box in an internal list (an array of strings called `lines`).
 38: *   **It knows where the cursor is:** It keeps track of the cursor's position (which `row` and `column` it's on).
 39: *   **It handles edits:** When you press keys like letters, numbers, Backspace, Delete, or Enter, the `TextBuffer` modifies the text and updates the cursor position accordingly.
 40: *   **It manages scrolling:** If your text gets longer than the input box can display, the `TextBuffer` figures out which part of the text should be visible.
 41: 
 42: The `MultilineTextEditor` React component we saw in Chapter 1 uses an instance of this `TextBuffer` internally to manage the state of the text being edited.
 43: 
 44: ## How You Use It (Indirectly)
 45: 
 46: You don't directly interact with `TextBuffer` yourself. You interact with the `<MultilineTextEditor>` component displayed by Ink. But understanding `TextBuffer` helps you see *how* the editor works.
 47: 
 48: Let's look at a simplified view of how the `<TerminalChatNewInput>` component uses `<MultilineTextEditor>`:
 49: 
 50: ```tsx
 51: // File: codex-cli/src/components/chat/terminal-chat-new-input.tsx (Simplified)
 52: import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";
 53: import { Box, Text, useInput } from "ink";
 54: import MultilineTextEditor from "./multiline-editor"; // Our editor component
 55: // ... other imports
 56: 
 57: export default function TerminalChatInput({ submitInput, active, /* ... */ }) {
 58:   const [input, setInput] = useState(""); // Holds the current text in the editor state
 59:   const [history, setHistory] = useState<string[]>([]); // Holds past submitted messages
 60:   const [historyIndex, setHistoryIndex] = useState<number | null>(null);
 61:   // Used to force re-render editor when history changes text
 62:   const [editorKey, setEditorKey] = useState(0);
 63:   const editorRef = React.useRef(/* ... */); // Handle to the editor
 64: 
 65:   // --- History Handling (Simplified) ---
 66:   useInput((_input, key) => {
 67:     // Check if Up/Down arrow pressed AND cursor is at top/bottom line
 68:     const isAtTop = editorRef.current?.isCursorAtFirstRow();
 69:     const isAtBottom = editorRef.current?.isCursorAtLastRow();
 70: 
 71:     if (key.upArrow && isAtTop && history.length > 0) {
 72:       // Logic to go back in history
 73:       const newIndex = historyIndex === null ? history.length - 1 : Math.max(0, historyIndex - 1);
 74:       setHistoryIndex(newIndex);
 75:       setInput(history[newIndex] ?? ""); // Set the text to the historical item
 76:       setEditorKey(k => k + 1); // Force editor to re-mount with new text
 77:       // ... save draft if needed ...
 78:     } else if (key.downArrow && isAtBottom && historyIndex !== null) {
 79:       // Logic to go forward in history or restore draft
 80:       // ... similar logic using setInput, setHistoryIndex, setEditorKey ...
 81:     }
 82:     // Note: If not handling history, the key press falls through to MultilineTextEditor
 83:   }, { isActive: active });
 84: 
 85: 
 86:   // --- Submission Handling ---
 87:   const onSubmit = useCallback((textFromEditor: string) => {
 88:     const trimmedText = textFromEditor.trim();
 89:     if (!trimmedText) return; // Ignore empty submissions
 90: 
 91:     // Add to history
 92:     setHistory(prev => [...prev, textFromEditor]);
 93:     setHistoryIndex(null); // Reset history navigation
 94: 
 95:     // Send the input to the Agent Loop!
 96:     submitInput(/* ... create input item from trimmedText ... */);
 97: 
 98:     // Clear the input for the next message
 99:     setInput("");
100:     setEditorKey(k => k + 1); // Force editor reset
101: 
102:   }, [submitInput, setHistory /* ... */]);
103: 
104:   return (
105:     <Box flexDirection="column" borderStyle="round">
106:       {/* The actual editor component */}
107:       <MultilineTextEditor
108:         ref={editorRef} // Connect ref for cursor position checks
109:         key={editorKey} // Force re-render on key change
110:         initialText={input} // Tell editor what text to display initially
111:         focus={active} // Tell editor whether to capture keys
112:         onChange={(text) => setInput(text)} // Update React state when text changes internally
113:         onSubmit={onSubmit} // Tell editor what to do on Enter
114:         height={8} // Example height
115:       />
116:       <Text dimColor>ctrl+c exit | enter send | ↑↓ history | ctrl+x editor</Text>
117:     </Box>
118:   );
119: }
120: ```
121: 
122: *   **`initialText={input}`:** The `<MultilineTextEditor>` starts with the text held in the `input` state variable. This is how history navigation works – we change `input` and force a re-render.
123: *   **`onChange={(text) => setInput(text)}`:** Whenever the text *inside* the `MultilineTextEditor` (managed by its internal `TextBuffer`) changes, it calls this function. We update the `input` state variable in the parent component (`TerminalChatNewInput`) to keep track, though often the editor manages its own state primarily.
124: *   **`onSubmit={onSubmit}`:** When you press Enter (in a way that signifies submission, not just adding a newline), the `MultilineTextEditor` calls this `onSubmit` function, passing the final text content. This function then sends the message off to the [Agent Loop](03_agent_loop.md) and clears the input.
125: *   **History (`useInput`):** The parent component (`TerminalChatNewInput`) uses Ink's `useInput` hook to *intercept* the Up/Down arrow keys *before* they even reach the `MultilineTextEditor`. It checks if the cursor (using `editorRef.current?.isCursorAtFirstRow()`) is at the very top/bottom edge of the text. If so, it handles history navigation by changing the `input` state and forcing the editor to update using `setEditorKey`. If the cursor isn't at the edge, it lets the arrow key "fall through" to the `MultilineTextEditor`, which then just moves the cursor normally within the text via its internal `TextBuffer`.
126: 
127: ## Under the Hood: Keystroke to Display
128: 
129: Let's trace what happens when you type a character, say 'h', into the input box:
130: 
131: ```mermaid
132: sequenceDiagram
133:     participant User
134:     participant Terminal
135:     participant InkUI as Ink/React (MultilineTextEditor)
136:     participant TextBuffer
137:     participant AgentLoop as Agent Loop (Not involved)
138: 
139:     User->>Terminal: Presses 'h' key
140:     Terminal->>InkUI: Terminal sends key event to Ink
141:     InkUI->>InkUI: `useInput` hook captures 'h'
142:     InkUI->>TextBuffer: Calls `handleInput('h', { ... }, viewport)`
143:     TextBuffer->>TextBuffer: Finds current line ("") and cursor (0,0)
144:     TextBuffer->>TextBuffer: Calls `insert('h')`
145:     TextBuffer->>TextBuffer: Updates `lines` to `["h"]`
146:     TextBuffer->>TextBuffer: Updates `cursorCol` to 1
147:     TextBuffer->>TextBuffer: Increments internal `version`
148:     TextBuffer-->>InkUI: Returns `true` (buffer was modified)
149:     InkUI->>InkUI: Triggers a React re-render because internal state changed
150:     InkUI->>TextBuffer: Calls `getVisibleLines(viewport)` -> returns `["h"]`
151:     InkUI->>TextBuffer: Calls `getCursor()` -> returns `[0, 1]`
152:     InkUI->>Terminal: Renders the updated text ("h") with cursor highlight
153: ```
154: 
155: 1.  **Keystroke:** You press the 'h' key.
156: 2.  **Capture:** Ink's `useInput` hook within `<MultilineTextEditor>` receives the key event.
157: 3.  **Delegate:** `<MultilineTextEditor>` calls the `handleInput` method on its internal `TextBuffer` instance, passing the input character ('h'), key modifier flags (like Shift, Ctrl - none in this case), and the current visible area size (viewport).
158: 4.  **Update State:** `TextBuffer.handleInput` determines it's a simple character insertion. It calls its internal `insert` method.
159: 5.  **`insert` Method:**
160:     *   Gets the current line (e.g., `""`).
161:     *   Splits the line at the cursor position (0).
162:     *   Inserts the character: `""` + `'h'` + `""` -> `"h"`.
163:     *   Updates the `lines` array: `["h"]`.
164:     *   Updates the cursor column: `0` -> `1`.
165:     *   Increments an internal version number to track changes.
166: 6.  **Signal Change:** `handleInput` returns `true` because the buffer was modified.
167: 7.  **Re-render:** The `<MultilineTextEditor>` component detects the change (either via the return value or its internal state update) and triggers a React re-render.
168: 8.  **Get Display Data:** During the render, `<MultilineTextEditor>` calls methods on the `TextBuffer` like:
169:     *   `getVisibleLines()`: Gets the lines of text that should currently be visible based on scrolling.
170:     *   `getCursor()`: Gets the current row and column of the cursor.
171: 9.  **Draw:** The component uses this information to render the text (`h`) in the terminal. It uses the cursor position to draw the cursor, often by rendering the character *at* the cursor position with an inverted background color (like `chalk.inverse(char)`).
172: 
173: This same loop happens for every key press: Backspace calls `TextBuffer.backspace()`, arrow keys call `TextBuffer.move()`, Enter calls `TextBuffer.newline()` (or triggers `onSubmit`), etc.
174: 
175: ## Diving into `TextBuffer` Code (Simplified)
176: 
177: Let's peek inside `text-buffer.ts`:
178: 
179: ```typescript
180: // File: codex-cli/src/text-buffer.ts (Simplified)
181: 
182: // Helper to check if a character is part of a "word"
183: function isWordChar(ch: string | undefined): boolean {
184:   // Simplified: returns true if not whitespace or basic punctuation
185:   return ch !== undefined && !/[\s,.;!?]/.test(ch);
186: }
187: 
188: // Helper to get the length respecting multi-byte characters (like emoji)
189: function cpLen(str: string): number { return Array.from(str).length; }
190: // Helper to slice respecting multi-byte characters

331:     // 6. Clean up the temp file
332:     this.version++;
333:   }
334: }
335: ```
336: 
337: *   The `lines` array holds the actual text content.
338: *   `cursorRow` and `cursorCol` track the insertion point.
339: *   Methods like `insert`, `backspace`, `newline`, and `move` directly manipulate `lines`, `cursorRow`, and `cursorCol`. They use helpers like `cpLen` and `cpSlice` to correctly handle characters that might take up more than one byte (like emojis).
340: *   `handleInput` acts as the main entry point, deciding which specific editing operation to perform based on the key pressed.
341: *   `openInExternalEditor` handles the `Ctrl+X` magic by saving to a temp file, running your system's default editor, and reloading the content.
342: 
343: ## Conclusion
344: 
345: You've now seen how Codex provides a surprisingly powerful text editing experience right within your terminal. It goes far beyond a simple input line by using the `<MultilineTextEditor>` component, which relies heavily on the internal `TextBuffer` class. This class manages the text content, cursor position, and editing operations like insertion, deletion, multi-line handling, cursor navigation (including word jumps), and even integration with external editors. This allows you to compose complex prompts or provide detailed feedback without leaving the terminal interface.
346: 
347: With the UI drawn and user input handled, what happens next? How does Codex take your input, think about it, and generate a response or decide to run a command? That's the job of the core logic loop.

  8: # Chapter 3: Agent Loop
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](02_input_handling__textbuffer_editor_.md), we saw how Codex captures your commands and messages using a neat multi-line input editor. But once you hit Enter, where does that input *go*? What part of Codex actually understands your request, talks to the AI, and makes things happen?
 11: 
 12: Meet the **Agent Loop**, the heart and brain of the Codex CLI.
 13: 
 14: ## What's the Big Idea? Like a Helpful Assistant
 15: 
 16: Imagine you have a very capable personal assistant. You give them a task, like "Find the latest sales report, summarize it, and email it to the team." Your assistant doesn't just magically do it all at once. They follow a process:
 17: 
 18: 1.  **Understand the Request:** Listen carefully to what you asked for.
 19: 2.  **Gather Information:** Look for the sales report file.
 20: 3.  **Perform Actions:** Read the report, write a summary.
 21: 4.  **Ask for Confirmation (if needed):** "I've drafted the summary and email. Should I send it now?"
 22: 5.  **Complete the Task:** Send the email after getting your 'yes'.
 23: 6.  **Report Back:** Let you know the email has been sent.
 24: 
 25: The **Agent Loop** in Codex acts much like this assistant. It's the central piece of logic that manages the entire conversation and workflow between you and the AI model (like OpenAI's GPT-4).
 26: 
 27: Let's take our simple example: You type `codex "write a python script that prints hello world and run it"`.
 28: 
 29: The Agent Loop is responsible for:
 30: 
 31: 1.  Taking your input ("write a python script...").
 32: 2.  Sending this request to the powerful AI model via the OpenAI API.
 33: 3.  Getting the AI's response, which might include:
 34:     *   Text: "Okay, here's the script..."
 35:     *   A request to perform an action (a "function call"): "I need to run this command: `python -c 'print(\"hello world\")'`"
 36: 4.  Showing you the text part of the response in the [Terminal UI](01_terminal_ui__ink_components_.md).
 37: 5.  Handling the "function call":
 38:     *   Checking if it needs your permission based on the [Approval Policy](04_approval_policy___security.md).
 39:     *   If needed, asking you "Allow command?" via the UI.
 40:     *   If approved, actually running the command using the [Command Execution & Sandboxing](06_command_execution___sandboxing.md) system.
 41: 6.  Getting the result of the command (the output "hello world").
 42: 7.  Sending that result back to the AI ("I ran the command, and it printed 'hello world'").
 43: 8.  Getting the AI's final response (maybe: "Great, the script ran successfully!").
 44: 9.  Showing you the final response.
 45: 10. Updating the conversation history with everything that happened.
 46: 
 47: It's called a "loop" because it often goes back and forth between you, the AI, and tools (like the command line) until your request is fully handled.
 48: 
 49: ## How It Works: The Conversation Cycle
 50: 
 51: The Agent Loop orchestrates a cycle:
 52: 
 53: ```mermaid
 54: graph TD
 55:     A[User Input] --> B[Agent Loop]
 56:     B --> C{Send to AI Model}
 57:     C --> D[AI Response: Text or Tool Call]
 58:     D --> B
 59:     B --> E{Process Response}
 60:     E -- Text --> F[Show Text in UI]
 61:     E -- Tool Call --> G{Handle Tool Call}
 62:     G --> H{Needs Approval?}
 63:     H -- Yes --> I[Ask User via UI]
 64:     I --> J{User Approves?}
 65:     H -- No --> K[Execute Tool]
 66:     J -- Yes --> K
 67:     J -- No --> L[Report Denial to AI]
 68:     K --> M[Get Tool Result]
 69:     M --> B
 70:     L --> B
 71:     F --> N[Update History]
 72:     M --> N
 73:     L --> N
 74:     N --> O[Ready for next Input/Step]
 75: ```
 76: 
 77: 1.  **Input:** Gets input from you (via the [Input Handling](02_input_handling__textbuffer_editor_.md)).
 78: 2.  **AI Call:** Sends the current conversation state (including your latest input and any previous steps) to the AI model (OpenAI API).
 79: 3.  **Response Processing:** Receives the AI's response. This could be simple text, or it could include a request to use a tool (like running a shell command). This is covered more in [Response & Tool Call Handling](05_response___tool_call_handling.md).
 80: 4.  **Tool Handling:** If the AI requested a tool:
 81:     *   Check the [Approval Policy](04_approval_policy___security.md).
 82:     *   Potentially ask you for confirmation via the [Terminal UI](01_terminal_ui__ink_components_.md).
 83:     *   If approved, execute the tool via [Command Execution & Sandboxing](06_command_execution___sandboxing.md).
 84:     *   Package the tool's result (e.g., command output) to send back to the AI in the next step.
 85: 5.  **Update State:** Adds the AI's message and any tool results to the conversation history. Shows updates in the UI.
 86: 6.  **Loop:** If the task isn't finished (e.g., because a tool was used and the AI needs to react to the result), it sends the updated conversation back to the AI (Step 2). If the task *is* finished, it waits for your next input.
 87: 
 88: ## Using the Agent Loop (From the UI's Perspective)
 89: 
 90: You don't directly interact with the `AgentLoop` class code when *using* Codex. Instead, the main UI component (`TerminalChat` in `terminal-chat.tsx`) creates and manages an `AgentLoop` instance.
 91: 
 92: Think of the UI component holding the "remote control" for the Agent Loop assistant.
 93: 
 94: ```tsx
 95: // File: codex-cli/src/components/chat/terminal-chat.tsx (Highly Simplified)
 96: import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";
 97: import { AgentLoop } from "../../utils/agent/agent-loop";
 98: // ... other imports: UI components, config types ...
 99: 
100: export default function TerminalChat({ config, approvalPolicy, /* ... */ }) {
101:   const [items, setItems] = useState([]); // Holds conversation messages
102:   const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false); // Is the assistant busy?
103:   const [confirmationPrompt, setConfirmationPrompt] = useState(null); // Command to review?
104:   const agentRef = useRef<AgentLoop | null>(null); // Holds the assistant instance
105: 
106:   // Create the assistant when the component loads or config changes
107:   useEffect(() => {
108:     agentRef.current = new AgentLoop({
109:       model: config.model,
110:       config: config,
111:       approvalPolicy: approvalPolicy,
112:       // --- Callbacks: How the assistant reports back ---
113:       onItem: (newItem) => { // When the assistant has a message/result
114:         setItems((prev) => [...prev, newItem]); // Add it to our chat history
115:       },
116:       onLoading: (isLoading) => { // When the assistant starts/stops thinking
117:         setLoading(isLoading);
118:       },
119:       getCommandConfirmation: async (command, /*...*/) => { // When the assistant needs approval
120:         // Show the command in the UI and wait for user's Yes/No
121:         const userDecision = await showConfirmationUI(command);
122:         return { review: userDecision /* ... */ };
123:       },
124:       // ... other callbacks like onLastResponseId ...
125:     });
126: 
127:     return () => agentRef.current?.terminate(); // Clean up when done
128:   }, [config, approvalPolicy /* ... */]);
129: 
130:   // --- Function to send user input to the assistant ---
131:   const submitInputToAgent = (userInput) => {
132:     if (agentRef.current) {
133:       // Tell the assistant to process this input
134:       agentRef.current.run([userInput /* ... */]);
135:     }
136:   };
137: 
138:   // --- UI Rendering ---
139:   return (
140:     <Box>
141:       {/* Display 'items' using TerminalMessageHistory */}
142:       {/* Display input box (TerminalChatInput) or confirmationPrompt */}
143:       {/* Pass `submitInputToAgent` to the input box */}
144:       {/* Pass function to handle confirmation decision */}
145:     </Box>
146:   );
147: }
148: ```
149: 
150: *   **Initialization:** The UI creates an `AgentLoop`, giving it the necessary configuration ([Configuration Management](07_configuration_management.md)) and crucial **callback functions**. These callbacks are how the Agent Loop communicates back to the UI:
151:     *   `onItem`: "Here's a new message (from user, AI, or tool) to display."
152:     *   `onLoading`: "I'm starting/stopping my work."
153:     *   `getCommandConfirmation`: "I need to run this command. Please ask the user and tell me their decision."
154: *   **Running:** When you submit input via the `<TerminalChatInput>`, the UI calls the `agentRef.current.run(...)` method, handing off your request to the Agent Loop.
155: *   **Updates:** The Agent Loop does its work, calling the `onItem` and `onLoading` callbacks whenever something changes. The UI listens to these callbacks and updates the display accordingly (setting state variables like `items` and `loading`, which causes React to re-render).
156: *   **Confirmation:** If the Agent Loop needs approval, it calls `getCommandConfirmation`. The UI pauses, shows the command review prompt, waits for your decision, and then returns the decision back to the Agent Loop, which then proceeds or stops based on your choice.
157: 
158: ## Under the Hood: A Step-by-Step Flow
159: 
160: Let's trace our "hello world" example again, focusing on the interactions:
161: 
162: ```mermaid
163: sequenceDiagram
164:     participant User
165:     participant InkUI as Terminal UI (Ink)
166:     participant AgentLoop
167:     participant OpenAI
168:     participant CmdExec as Command Execution
169: 
170:     User->>InkUI: Types "write & run hello world", presses Enter
171:     InkUI->>AgentLoop: Calls `run(["write & run..."])`
172:     AgentLoop->>AgentLoop: Sets loading=true (calls `onLoading(true)`)
173:     InkUI->>User: Shows loading indicator
174:     AgentLoop->>OpenAI: Sends request: ["write & run..."]
175:     OpenAI-->>AgentLoop: Streams response: [Text: "Okay, try:", ToolCall: `shell(...)`]
176:     AgentLoop->>InkUI: Calls `onItem(Text: "Okay, try:")`
177:     InkUI->>User: Displays "Okay, try:"
178:     AgentLoop->>AgentLoop: Processes ToolCall `shell(...)`
179:     Note over AgentLoop: Checks Approval Policy
180:     AgentLoop->>InkUI: Calls `getCommandConfirmation(["python", "-c", "..."])`
181:     InkUI->>User: Displays "Allow command: python -c '...'?" [Yes/No]
182:     User->>InkUI: Clicks/Types 'Yes'
183:     InkUI-->>AgentLoop: Returns confirmation result ({ review: YES })
184:     AgentLoop->>CmdExec: Executes `python -c 'print("hello world")'`
185:     CmdExec-->>AgentLoop: Returns result (stdout: "hello world", exit code: 0)
186:     AgentLoop->>AgentLoop: Creates `function_call_output` item
187:     AgentLoop->>OpenAI: Sends request: [..., ToolCall: `shell(...)`, Output: "hello world"]
188:     OpenAI-->>AgentLoop: Streams response: [Text: "Command ran successfully!"]
189:     AgentLoop->>InkUI: Calls `onItem(Text: "Command ran...")`
190:     InkUI->>User: Displays "Command ran successfully!"
191:     AgentLoop->>AgentLoop: Sets loading=false (calls `onLoading(false)`)
192:     InkUI->>User: Hides loading indicator, shows input prompt
193: ```
194: 
195: This diagram shows the back-and-forth orchestration performed by the Agent Loop, coordinating between the UI, the AI model, and the command execution system.
196: 
197: ## Inside `agent-loop.ts`
198: 
199: The core logic lives in `codex-cli/src/utils/agent/agent-loop.ts`. Let's peek at a *very* simplified structure:
200: 
201: ```typescript
202: // File: codex-cli/src/utils/agent/agent-loop.ts (Simplified)
203: import OpenAI from "openai";
204: // ... other imports: types for config, responses, approval ...
205: import { handleExecCommand } from "./handle-exec-command"; // For tool calls
206: 
207: export class AgentLoop {
208:   private oai: OpenAI; // The OpenAI client instance
209:   private model: string;
210:   private config: AppConfig;
211:   private approvalPolicy: ApprovalPolicy;
212:   // Callbacks provided by the UI:
213:   private onItem: (item: ResponseItem) => void;
214:   private onLoading: (loading: boolean) => void;
215:   private getCommandConfirmation: (/*...*/) => Promise<CommandConfirmation>;
216:   // ... other state like current stream, cancellation flags ...
217: 
218:   constructor({ model, config, approvalPolicy, onItem, onLoading, getCommandConfirmation, /*...*/ }: AgentLoopParams) {
219:     this.model = model;
220:     this.config = config;
221:     this.approvalPolicy = approvalPolicy;
222:     this.onItem = onItem;
223:     this.onLoading = onLoading;
224:     this.getCommandConfirmation = getCommandConfirmation;
225:     this.oai = new OpenAI({ /* ... API key, base URL ... */ });
226:     // ... initialize other state ...
227:   }
228: 
229:   // The main method called by the UI
230:   public async run(input: Array<ResponseInputItem>, previousResponseId: string = ""): Promise<void> {
231:     this.onLoading(true); // Signal start
232:     let turnInput = input; // Input for this step of the loop
233:     let lastResponseId = previousResponseId;
234: 
235:     try {
236:       // Keep looping as long as there's input (initially user msg, later tool results)
237:       while (turnInput.length > 0) {
238:         // 1. Send current input history to OpenAI API
239:         const stream = await this.oai.responses.create({
240:           model: this.model,
241:           input: turnInput, // Includes user message or tool results
242:           previous_response_id: lastResponseId || undefined,
243:           stream: true,
244:           // ... other parameters like instructions, tools ...
245:         });
246: 
247:         turnInput = []; // Clear input for the next loop iteration
248: 
249:         // 2. Process the stream of events from OpenAI
250:         for await (const event of stream) {
251:           if (event.type === "response.output_item.done") {
252:             const item = event.item; // Could be text, function_call, etc.
253:             this.onItem(item as ResponseItem); // Send item to UI to display
254:           }
255:           if (event.type === "response.completed") {
256:             lastResponseId = event.response.id; // Remember the ID for the next call
257:             // Check the final output for tool calls
258:             for (const item of event.response.output) {
259:               if (item.type === "function_call") {
260:                  // Handle the tool call (ask for approval, execute)
261:                  // This might add a 'function_call_output' to `turnInput`
262:                  const toolResults = await this.handleFunctionCall(item);
263:                  turnInput.push(...toolResults);
264:               }
265:             }
266:           }
267:           // ... handle other event types ...
268:         } // End stream processing
269:       } // End while loop (no more input for this turn)
270:     } catch (error) {
271:       // ... Handle errors (network issues, API errors etc.) ...
272:       this.onItem(/* Create system error message */);
273:     } finally {
274:       this.onLoading(false); // Signal end
275:     }
276:   }
277: 
278:   // Helper to handle tool/function calls
279:   private async handleFunctionCall(item: ResponseFunctionToolCall): Promise<Array<ResponseInputItem>> {
280:     // ... Parse arguments from 'item' ...
281:     const args = /* ... parse item.arguments ... */;
282:     let outputText = "Error: Unknown function";
283:     let metadata = {};
284: 
285:     if (item.name === "shell") { // Example: handle shell commands
286:        // This uses the approval policy and getCommandConfirmation callback!
287:        const result = await handleExecCommand(
288:          args,
289:          this.config,
290:          this.approvalPolicy,
291:          this.getCommandConfirmation,
292:          /* ... cancellation signal ... */
293:        );
294:        outputText = result.outputText;
295:        metadata = result.metadata;
296:     }
297:     // ... handle other function names ...
298: 
299:     // Format the result to send back to OpenAI in the next turn
300:     const outputItem: ResponseInputItem.FunctionCallOutput = {
301:       type: "function_call_output",
302:       call_id: item.call_id, // Link to the specific function call
303:       output: JSON.stringify({ output: outputText, metadata }),
304:     };
305:     return [outputItem]; // This goes into `turnInput` for the next loop
306:   }
307: 
308:   // ... other methods like cancel(), terminate() ...
309: }
310: ```
311: 
312: *   **Constructor:** Sets up the connection to OpenAI and stores the configuration and callbacks passed in by the UI.
313: *   **`run()`:** This is the main engine.
314:     *   It signals loading starts (`onLoading(true)`).
315:     *   It enters a `while` loop that continues as long as there's something to send to the AI (initially the user's message, later potentially the results from tools).
316:     *   Inside the loop, it calls `this.oai.responses.create()` to talk to the AI model, sending the current conversation turn.
317:     *   It processes the `stream` of events coming back from the AI.
318:     *   For each piece of content (`response.output_item.done`), it calls `onItem` to show it in the UI.
319:     *   When the AI's turn is complete (`response.completed`), it checks if the AI asked to use any tools (`function_call`).
320:     *   If a tool call is found, it calls `handleFunctionCall`.
321: *   **`handleFunctionCall()`:**
322:     *   Parses the details of the tool request (e.g., the command arguments).
323:     *   Uses `handleExecCommand` (which contains logic related to [Approval Policy](04_approval_policy___security.md) and [Command Execution](06_command_execution___sandboxing.md)) to potentially run the command, using the `getCommandConfirmation` callback if needed.
324:     *   Formats the result of the tool execution (e.g., command output) into a specific `function_call_output` message.
325:     *   Returns this output message. The `run` method adds this to `turnInput`, so the *next* iteration of the `while` loop will send this result back to the AI, letting it know what happened.
326: *   **Finally:** Once the `while` loop finishes (meaning the AI didn't request any more tools in its last response), it signals loading is done (`onLoading(false)`).
327: 
328: This loop ensures that the conversation flows logically, handling text, tool requests, user approvals, and tool results in a structured way.
329: 
330: ## Conclusion
331: 
332: The Agent Loop is the central orchestrator within Codex. It acts like a diligent assistant, taking your requests, interacting with the powerful AI model, managing tools like shell commands, ensuring safety through approvals, and keeping the conversation state updated. It connects the [Terminal UI](01_terminal_ui__ink_components_.md) where you interact, the [Input Handling](02_input_handling__textbuffer_editor_.md) that captures your text, the AI model that provides intelligence, and the systems that actually execute actions ([Command Execution & Sandboxing](06_command_execution___sandboxing.md)).
333: 
334: Understanding the Agent Loop helps you see how Codex manages the complex back-and-forth required to turn your natural language requests into concrete actions. But when the Agent Loop wants to run a command suggested by the AI, how does Codex decide whether to ask for your permission first? That crucial safety mechanism is the topic of our next chapter.

  8: # Chapter 4: Approval Policy & Security
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](03_agent_loop.md), we saw how the **Agent Loop** acts like Codex's brain, talking to the AI and figuring out what steps to take. Sometimes, the AI might suggest actions that could change things on your computer, like modifying a file or running a command in your terminal (e.g., `git commit`, `npm install`, or even `rm important_file.txt`!).
 11: 
 12: This sounds powerful, but also a little scary, right? What if the AI misunderstands and suggests deleting the wrong file? We need a way to control how much power Codex has.
 13: 
 14: That's exactly what the **Approval Policy & Security** system does. It's like a security guard standing between the AI's suggestions and your actual computer.
 15: 
 16: ## What's the Big Idea? The Security Guard
 17: 
 18: Imagine you're visiting a secure building. Depending on your pass, you have different levels of access:
 19: 
 20: *   **Guest Pass (`suggest` mode):** You can look around (read files), but if you want to open a door (modify a file) or use special equipment (run a command), you need to ask the guard for permission every single time.
 21: *   **Employee Badge (`auto-edit` mode):** You can open regular office doors (modify files in the project) without asking each time, but you still need permission for restricted areas like the server room (running commands).
 22: *   **Full Access Badge (`full-auto` mode):** You can go almost anywhere (modify files, run commands), but for potentially sensitive actions (like running commands), the guard might escort you to a special monitored room (a "sandbox") to ensure safety.
 23: 
 24: The Approval Policy in Codex works just like these passes. It lets *you* choose how much autonomy Codex has when it suggests potentially risky actions.
 25: 
 26: ## Key Concepts: The Approval Modes
 27: 
 28: Codex offers different levels of autonomy, which you can usually set with a command-line flag like `--approval-mode` or when you first configure it. These are the main modes:
 29: 
 30: 1.  **`suggest` (Default):**
 31:     *   **What it is:** The most cautious mode. Like the Guest Pass.
 32:     *   **What it does:** Codex can read files to understand your project, but before it *modifies* any file or *runs* any command, it will always stop and ask for your explicit permission through the [Terminal UI](01_terminal_ui__ink_components_.md).
 33:     *   **Use when:** You want maximum control and want to review every single change or command.
 34: 
 35: 2.  **`auto-edit`:**
 36:     *   **What it is:** Allows automatic file edits, but still requires approval for commands. Like the Employee Badge.
 37:     *   **What it does:** Codex can automatically apply changes (patches) to files within your project directory. However, if it wants to run a shell command (like `npm install`, `git commit`, `python script.py`), it will still stop and ask for your permission.
 38:     *   **Use when:** You trust the AI to make code changes but still want to manually approve any commands it tries to run.
 39: 
 40: 3.  **`full-auto`:**
 41:     *   **What it is:** The most autonomous mode, allowing file edits and command execution, but with safeguards. Like the Full Access Badge with escort.
 42:     *   **What it does:** Codex can automatically apply file changes *and* run shell commands without asking you first. Crucially, to prevent accidental damage, commands run in this mode are typically executed inside a **sandbox** – a restricted environment that limits what the command can do (e.g., blocking network access, limiting file access to the project directory). We'll learn more about this in the [Command Execution & Sandboxing](06_command_execution___sandboxing.md) chapter.
 43:     *   **Use when:** You want Codex to work as independently as possible, understanding that potentially risky commands are run with safety restrictions.
 44: 
 45: ## How it Works in Practice
 46: 
 47: When the [Agent Loop](03_agent_loop.md) receives a suggestion from the AI to perform an action (like applying a patch or running a shell command), it doesn't just blindly execute it. Instead, it checks the current Approval Policy you've set.
 48: 
 49: ```mermaid
 50: sequenceDiagram
 51:     participant AgentLoop as Agent Loop
 52:     participant ApprovalCheck as Approval Policy Check
 53:     participant UserUI as Terminal UI
 54:     participant CmdExec as Command Execution
 55: 
 56:     AgentLoop->>AgentLoop: AI suggests action (e.g., run `npm install`)
 57:     AgentLoop->>ApprovalCheck: Check action against policy (`auto-edit`)
 58:     ApprovalCheck->>ApprovalCheck: Action is `npm install` (command)
 59:     ApprovalCheck->>ApprovalCheck: Policy is `auto-edit` (commands need approval)
 60:     ApprovalCheck-->>AgentLoop: Decision: `ask-user`
 61:     AgentLoop->>UserUI: Request confirmation for `npm install`
 62:     UserUI->>UserUI: Display "Allow command `npm install`? [Y/n]"
 63:     UserUI-->>AgentLoop: User response (e.g., Yes)
 64:     AgentLoop->>CmdExec: Execute `npm install`
 65: ```
 66: 
 67: 1.  **Suggestion:** The AI tells the Agent Loop it wants to run `npm install`.
 68: 2.  **Check Policy:** The Agent Loop asks the Approval Policy system: "The AI wants to run `npm install`. The user set the policy to `auto-edit`. Is this okay?"
 69: 3.  **Decision:** The Approval Policy system checks its rules:
 70:     *   The action is a shell command.
 71:     *   The policy is `auto-edit`.
 72:     *   Rule: In `auto-edit` mode, shell commands require user approval.
 73:     *   Result: The decision is `ask-user`.
 74: 4.  **Ask User:** The Agent Loop receives the `ask-user` decision and uses the `getCommandConfirmation` callback (provided by the [Terminal UI](01_terminal_ui__ink_components_.md)) to display the prompt to you.
 75: 5.  **User Response:** You see the prompt and respond (e.g., 'Yes').
 76: 6.  **Execute (if approved):** The Agent Loop receives your 'Yes' and proceeds to execute the command, potentially using the [Command Execution & Sandboxing](06_command_execution___sandboxing.md) system.
 77: 
 78: If the policy had been `full-auto`, the decision in Step 3 might have been `auto-approve` (with `runInSandbox: true`), and the Agent Loop would have skipped asking you (Steps 4 & 5) and gone straight to execution (Step 6), but inside the sandbox.
 79: 
 80: If the action was applying a file patch and the policy was `auto-edit` or `full-auto`, the decision might also be `auto-approve` (checking if the file path is allowed), skipping the user prompt.
 81: 
 82: ## Under the Hood: The `approvals.ts` Logic
 83: 
 84: The core logic for making these decisions lives in `codex-cli/src/approvals.ts`. A key function here is `canAutoApprove`.
 85: 
 86: ```typescript
 87: // File: codex-cli/src/approvals.ts (Simplified)
 88: 
 89: // Represents the different approval modes
 90: export type ApprovalPolicy = "suggest" | "auto-edit" | "full-auto";
 91: 
 92: // Represents the outcome of the safety check
 93: export type SafetyAssessment =
 94:   | { type: "auto-approve"; runInSandbox: boolean; reason: string; /*...*/ }
 95:   | { type: "ask-user"; applyPatch?: ApplyPatchCommand }
 96:   | { type: "reject"; reason: string };
 97: 
 98: // Input for apply_patch commands
 99: export type ApplyPatchCommand = { patch: string; };
100: 
101: /**
102:  * Checks if a command can be run automatically based on the policy.
103:  */
104: export function canAutoApprove(
105:   command: ReadonlyArray<string>, // e.g., ["git", "status"] or ["apply_patch", "..."]
106:   policy: ApprovalPolicy,
107:   writableRoots: ReadonlyArray<string>, // Allowed directories for edits
108:   // ... env ...
109: ): SafetyAssessment {
110:   // --- Special case: apply_patch ---
111:   if (command[0] === "apply_patch") {
112:     // Check if policy allows auto-editing and if patch only affects allowed files
113:     const applyPatchArg = command[1] as string;
114:     const patchDetails = { patch: applyPatchArg };
115: 
116:     if (policy === "suggest") return { type: "ask-user", applyPatch: patchDetails };
117: 
118:     if (isWritePatchConstrainedToWritablePaths(applyPatchArg, writableRoots)) {
119:        return { type: "auto-approve", runInSandbox: false, reason: "Patch affects allowed files", /*...*/ };
120:     }
121:     // If policy is auto-edit but patch affects disallowed files, ask user.
122:     // If policy is full-auto, still approve but mark for sandbox if paths are weird.
123:     return policy === "full-auto" ?
124:       { type: "auto-approve", runInSandbox: true, reason: "Full auto mode", /*...*/ } :
125:       { type: "ask-user", applyPatch: patchDetails };
126:   }
127: 
128:   // --- Check for known safe, read-only commands ---
129:   const knownSafe = isSafeCommand(command); // Checks things like "ls", "pwd", "git status"
130:   if (knownSafe != null) {
131:     return { type: "auto-approve", runInSandbox: false, reason: knownSafe.reason, /*...*/ };
132:   }
133: 
134:   // --- Handle shell commands (like "bash -lc 'npm install'") ---
135:   // (Simplified: assumes any other command needs policy check)
136: 
137:   // --- Default: Check policy for general commands ---
138:   if (policy === "full-auto") {
139:     return { type: "auto-approve", runInSandbox: true, reason: "Full auto mode", /*...*/ };
140:   } else {
141:     // 'suggest' and 'auto-edit' require asking for commands
142:     return { type: "ask-user" };
143:   }
144: }
145: 
146: // Helper to check if a command is known to be safe (read-only)
147: function isSafeCommand(command: ReadonlyArray<string>): { reason: string, group: string } | null {
148:   const cmd = command[0];
149:   if (["ls", "pwd", "cat", "git status", "git diff", /*...*/].includes(cmd)) {
150:      return { reason: `Safe read-only command: ${cmd}`, group: "Reading" };
151:   }
152:   return null;
153: }
154: 
155: // Helper (simplified) to check if patch affects allowed paths
156: function isWritePatchConstrainedToWritablePaths(
157:   patch: string,
158:   writableRoots: ReadonlyArray<string>
159: ): boolean {
160:   // ... logic to parse patch and check affected file paths ...
161:   // ... return true if all paths are within writableRoots ...
162:   return true; // Simplified for example
163: }
164: ```
165: 
166: *   **Inputs:** `canAutoApprove` takes the command the AI wants to run (as an array of strings, like `["npm", "install"]`), the current `ApprovalPolicy` (`suggest`, `auto-edit`, or `full-auto`), and a list of directories where file edits are allowed (`writableRoots`, usually just your project's main folder).
167: *   **Checks:** It first handles special cases like `apply_patch` (checking the policy and file paths) and known safe, read-only commands using `isSafeCommand`.
168: *   **Policy Decision:** For other commands, it primarily relies on the policy:
169:     *   If `full-auto`, it returns `auto-approve` but sets `runInSandbox` to `true`.
170:     *   If `suggest` or `auto-edit`, it returns `ask-user`.
171: *   **Output:** It returns a `SafetyAssessment` object telling the [Agent Loop](03_agent_loop.md) what to do: `auto-approve` (and whether sandboxing is needed), `ask-user`, or in rare cases, `reject` (if the command is fundamentally invalid).
172: 
173: This decision is then used back in the Agent Loop, often within a function like `handleExecCommand` (in `handle-exec-command.ts`), which we touched on in the previous chapter.
174: 
175: ```typescript
176: // File: codex-cli/src/utils/agent/handle-exec-command.ts (Simplified snippet)
177: 
178: import { canAutoApprove } from "../../approvals.js";
179: import { ReviewDecision } from "./review.js";
180: // ... other imports ...
181: 
182: export async function handleExecCommand(
183:   args: ExecInput, // Contains the command array `cmd`
184:   config: AppConfig,
185:   policy: ApprovalPolicy,
186:   getCommandConfirmation: (/*...*/) => Promise<CommandConfirmation>, // UI callback
187:   // ... abortSignal ...
188: ): Promise<HandleExecCommandResult> {
189: 
190:   // *** Check the approval policy first! ***
191:   const safety = canAutoApprove(args.cmd, policy, [process.cwd()]);
192: 
193:   let runInSandbox: boolean;
194:   switch (safety.type) {
195:     case "ask-user": {
196:       // Policy requires asking the user
197:       const { review: decision } = await getCommandConfirmation(args.cmd, safety.applyPatch);
198:       if (decision !== ReviewDecision.YES && decision !== ReviewDecision.ALWAYS) {
199:         // User said No or provided feedback to stop
200:         return { outputText: "aborted", metadata: { /*...*/ } };
201:       }
202:       // User approved! Proceed without sandbox (unless policy changes later).
203:       runInSandbox = false;
204:       break;
205:     }
206:     case "auto-approve": {
207:       // Policy allows auto-approval
208:       runInSandbox = safety.runInSandbox; // Respect sandbox flag from canAutoApprove
209:       break;
210:     }
211:     case "reject": {
212:       // Policy outright rejected the command
213:       return { outputText: "aborted", metadata: { reason: safety.reason } };
214:     }
215:   }
216: 
217:   // *** If approved (either automatically or by user), execute the command ***
218:   const summary = await execCommand(args, safety.applyPatch, runInSandbox, /*...*/);
219:   // ... handle results ...
220:   return convertSummaryToResult(summary);
221: }
222: ```
223: 
224: This shows how `canAutoApprove` is called first. If it returns `ask-user`, the `getCommandConfirmation` callback (which triggers the UI prompt) is invoked. Only if the assessment is `auto-approve` or the user explicitly approves does the code proceed to actually execute the command using `execCommand`, passing the `runInSandbox` flag determined by the policy check.
225: 
226: ## Conclusion
227: 
228: The Approval Policy & Security system is Codex's safety net. It puts you in control, letting you choose the balance between letting the AI work autonomously and requiring manual confirmation for actions that could affect your system. By understanding the `suggest`, `auto-edit`, and `full-auto` modes, you can configure Codex to operate in a way that matches your comfort level with automation and risk. This system works hand-in-hand with the [Agent Loop](03_agent_loop.md) to intercept potentially risky actions and enforce the rules you've set, sometimes using sandboxing (as we'll see later) for an extra layer of protection.
229: 
230: Now that we know how Codex decides *whether* to perform an action, how does it actually understand the AI's response, especially when the AI wants to use a tool like running a command or applying a patch?

  8: # Chapter 5: Response & Tool Call Handling
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](04_approval_policy___security.md), we learned how Codex decides *if* it's allowed to perform an action suggested by the AI, acting like a security guard based on the rules you set. But how does Codex understand the AI's response in the first place, especially when the AI wants to do something specific, like run a command or change a file?
 11: 
 12: That's where **Response & Tool Call Handling** comes in. Think of this part of Codex as its "ears" and "hands." It listens carefully to the instructions coming back from the AI model (the "response") and, if the AI asks to perform an action (a "tool call"), it figures out *exactly* what the AI wants to do (like which command to run or what file change to make) and gets ready to do it.
 13: 
 14: ## What's the Big Idea? Listening to the AI Assistant
 15: 
 16: Imagine you ask your super-smart assistant (the AI model) to do something like:
 17: 
 18: `codex "What's the status of my project? Use git status."`
 19: 
 20: The AI doesn't just send back plain text like "Okay, I'll run it." Instead, it sends back a more structured message, almost like filling out a form:
 21: 
 22: *   **Text Part:** "Okay, I will check the status of your project."
 23: *   **Action Part (Tool Call):**
 24:     *   **Tool Name:** `shell` (meaning: use the command line)
 25:     *   **Arguments:** `["git", "status"]` (meaning: the specific command to run)
 26: 
 27: Codex needs to understand this structured response. It needs to:
 28: 
 29: 1.  Recognize the plain text part and show it to you in the [Terminal UI](01_terminal_ui__ink_components_.md).
 30: 2.  See the "Action Part" (the Tool Call) and understand:
 31:     *   Which tool the AI wants to use (`shell`).
 32:     *   What specific details (arguments) are needed for that tool (`git status`).
 33: 
 34: This system is crucial because it translates the AI's intent into something Codex can actually act upon.
 35: 
 36: ## Key Concepts
 37: 
 38: 1.  **Structured Responses:** The OpenAI API doesn't just return a single block of text. It sends back data structured often like JSON. This allows the AI to clearly separate regular conversation text from requests to perform actions.
 39: 
 40:     ```json
 41:     // Simplified idea of an AI response
 42:     {
 43:       "id": "response_123",
 44:       "output": [
 45:         {
 46:           "type": "message", // A regular text message
 47:           "role": "assistant",
 48:           "content": [{ "type": "output_text", "text": "Okay, checking the status..." }]
 49:         },
 50:         {
 51:           "type": "function_call", // A request to use a tool!
 52:           "name": "shell",
 53:           "arguments": "{\"command\": [\"git\", \"status\"]}", // Details for the tool
 54:           "call_id": "call_abc"
 55:         }
 56:       ]
 57:       // ... other info ...
 58:     }
 59:     ```
 60:     This structure makes it easy for Codex to programmatically understand the different parts of the AI's message.
 61: 
 62: 2.  **Tool Calls (Function Calls):** When the AI wants to interact with the outside world (run a command, edit a file), it uses a special type of message in the response, often called a "function call" or "tool call". In Codex, common tool names are:
 63:     *   `shell`: Execute a command in the terminal.
 64:     *   `apply_patch`: Modify a file using a specific format called a "patch".
 65: 
 66: 3.  **Arguments:** The tool call includes the necessary details, called "arguments," usually formatted as a JSON string.
 67:     *   For the `shell` tool, the arguments specify the command to run (e.g., `{"command": ["git", "status"]}`).
 68:     *   For the `apply_patch` tool, the arguments contain the patch text describing the file changes (e.g., `{"patch": "*** Begin Patch..."}`).
 69: 
 70: ## How It Works: Decoding the AI's Message
 71: 
 72: When the [Agent Loop](03_agent_loop.md) receives a response from the OpenAI API, it goes through these steps:
 73: 
 74: ```mermaid
 75: sequenceDiagram
 76:     participant OpenAI
 77:     participant AgentLoop as Agent Loop
 78:     participant Parser as Response Parser
 79:     participant UI as Terminal UI
 80:     participant Approval as Approval Check
 81: 
 82:     OpenAI-->>AgentLoop: Sends structured response (Text + Tool Call)
 83:     AgentLoop->>Parser: Passes raw response data
 84:     Parser->>Parser: Extracts Text part ("Okay...")
 85:     Parser-->>AgentLoop: Returns extracted Text
 86:     AgentLoop->>UI: Sends Text to display ("onItem" callback)
 87:     Parser->>Parser: Extracts Tool Call part (shell, ["git", "status"])
 88:     Parser-->>AgentLoop: Returns Tool Name ("shell") & Arguments (["git", "status"])
 89:     AgentLoop->>Approval: Sends Tool details for policy check
 90:     Note over Approval: Next step: Chapter 4/6
 91: ```
 92: 
 93: 1.  **Receive Response:** The [Agent Loop](03_agent_loop.md) gets the structured response data from the OpenAI API.
 94: 2.  **Parse:** It uses helper functions (often found in `utils/parsers.ts`) to examine the response structure.
 95: 3.  **Extract Text:** If there's a regular text message (`"type": "message"`), it's extracted and sent to the [Terminal UI](01_terminal_ui__ink_components_.md) via the `onItem` callback to be displayed.
 96: 4.  **Extract Tool Call:** If there's a tool call (`"type": "function_call"`):
 97:     *   The **tool name** (e.g., `shell`) is identified.
 98:     *   The **arguments** string is extracted.
 99:     *   The arguments string (which is often JSON) is parsed to get the actual details (e.g., the `command` array `["git", "status"]`).
100: 5.  **Prepare for Action:** The Agent Loop now knows the specific tool and its arguments. It packages this information (tool name + parsed arguments) and prepares for the next stage: checking the [Approval Policy & Security](04_approval_policy___security.md) and, if approved, proceeding to [Command Execution & Sandboxing](06_command_execution___sandboxing.md).
101: 
102: ## Under the Hood: Parsing the Details
103: 
104: Let's look at simplified code snippets showing how this parsing happens.
105: 
106: ### In the Agent Loop (`agent-loop.ts`)
107: 
108: The `AgentLoop` processes events streamed from the OpenAI API. When a complete response arrives or a specific tool call item is identified, it needs handling.
109: 
110: ```typescript
111: // File: codex-cli/src/utils/agent/agent-loop.ts (Simplified)
112: 
113: // Inside the loop processing OpenAI stream events...
114: for await (const event of stream) {
115:   if (event.type === "response.output_item.done") {
116:     const item = event.item; // Could be text, function_call, etc.
117:     this.onItem(item as ResponseItem); // Send to UI
118: 
119:     // If it's a tool call, mark it for later processing
120:     if (item.type === "function_call") {
121:       // Store item.call_id or item details
122:       // to handle after the stream finishes
123:     }
124:   }
125:

186: ```
187: 
188: *   The loop iterates through the response `output` items.
189: *   If an item is a `function_call`, the `handleFunctionCall` helper is called.
190: *   `handleFunctionCall` extracts the `name` and `arguments`.
191: *   It crucially calls `parseToolCallArguments` (from `utils/parsers.ts`) to turn the JSON string `arguments` into a usable object.
192: *   Based on the `name` (`shell`, `apply_patch`), it calls the appropriate execution handler (like `handleExecCommand`), passing the parsed arguments. This handler coordinates with the [Approval Policy & Security](04_approval_policy___security.md) and [Command Execution & Sandboxing](06_command_execution___sandboxing.md) systems.
193: 
194: ### In the Parsers (`parsers.ts`)
195: 
196: This file contains helpers to decode the tool call details.
197: 
198: ```typescript
199: // File: codex-cli/src/utils/parsers.ts (Simplified)
200: import { formatCommandForDisplay } from "src/format-command.js";
201: // ... other imports ...
202: 
203: /**

205:  * Expects specific shapes for known tools like 'shell'.
206:  */
207: export function parseToolCallArguments(
208:   rawArguments: string,
209: ): ExecInput | undefined { // ExecInput contains { cmd, workdir, timeoutInMillis }
210:   let json: unknown;
211:   try {
212:     json = JSON.parse(rawArguments); // Basic JSON parsing
213:   } catch (err) {
214:     // Handle JSON parse errors
215:     return undefined;
216:   }
217: 
218:   if (typeof json !== "object" || json == null) return undefined;
219: 
220:   // Look for 'command' or 'cmd' property, expecting an array of strings
221:   const { cmd, command, patch /* other possible args */ } = json as Record<string, unknown>;
222:   const commandArray = toStringArray(cmd) ?? toStringArray(command);
223: 
224:   // If it's a shell command, require the command array
225:   if (commandArray != null) {
226:     return {
227:       cmd: commandArray,
228:       // Optional: extract workdir and timeout too
229:       workdir: typeof (json as any).workdir === "string" ? (json as any).workdir : undefined,
230:       timeoutInMillis: typeof (json as any).timeout === "number" ? (json as any).timeout : undefined,
231:     };
232:   }
233: 
234:   // If it's an apply_patch command, require the patch string
235:   if (typeof patch === 'string') {
236:     // Return a structure indicating it's a patch, maybe:
237:     // return { type: 'patch', patch: patch }; // Or incorporate into ExecInput if unified
238:     // For simplicity here, let's assume handleFunctionCall routes based on name,
239:     // so we might just return the raw parsed JSON for patch.
240:     // But a structured return is better. Let's adapt ExecInput slightly for demo:
241:     return { cmd: ['apply_patch'], patch: patch }; // Use a placeholder cmd
242:   }
243: 
244:   return undefined; // Unknown or invalid arguments structure
245: }
246: 
247: // Helper to check if an object is an array of strings
248: function toStringArray(obj: unknown): Array<string> | undefined {
249:   if (Array.isArray(obj) && obj.every((item) => typeof item === "string")) {
250:     return obj as Array<string>;
251:   }
252:   return undefined;
253: }
254: 
255: /**
256:  * Parses a full FunctionCall item for display/review purposes.
257:  */
258: export function parseToolCall(
259:   toolCall: ResponseFunctionToolCall,

262:   const args = parseToolCallArguments(toolCall.arguments);
263:   if (args == null) return undefined;

274:   };
275: }
276: ```
277: 
278: *   `parseToolCallArguments` takes the raw JSON string (`{"command": ["git", "status"]}`) and uses `JSON.parse`.
279: *   It then checks if the parsed object has the expected structure (e.g., a `command` property that is an array of strings for `shell`, or a `patch` string for `apply_patch`).
280: *   It returns a structured object (`ExecInput`) containing the validated arguments, or `undefined` if parsing fails.
281: *   `parseToolCall` uses `parseToolCallArguments` and then formats the command nicely for display using `formatCommandForDisplay`.
282: 
283: ### Handling Patches (`parse-apply-patch.ts`)
284: 
285: When the tool is `apply_patch`, the arguments contain a multi-line string describing the changes. Codex has specific logic to parse this format.
286: 
287: ```typescript
288: // File: codex-cli/src/utils/agent/parse-apply-patch.ts (Conceptual)
289: 
290: // Defines types like ApplyPatchOp (create, delete, update)
291: 
292: export function parseApplyPatch(patch: string): Array<ApplyPatchOp> | null {
293:   // 1. Check for "*** Begin Patch" and "*** End Patch" markers.
294:   if (!patch.startsWith("*** Begin Patch\n") || !patch.endsWith("\n*** End Patch")) {
295:     return null; // Invalid format
296:   }
297: 
298:   // 2. Extract the body between the markers.
299:   const patchBody = /* ... extract body ... */;
300:   const lines = patchBody.split('\n');
301: 
302:   const operations: Array<ApplyPatchOp> = [];
303:   for (const line of lines) {
304:     // 3. Check for operation markers:
305:     if (line.startsWith("*** Add File: ")) {
306:       operations.push({ type: "create", path: /* path */, content: "" });
307:     } else if (line.startsWith("*** Delete File: ")) {
308:       operations.push({ type: "delete", path: /* path */ });
309:     } else if (line.startsWith("*** Update File: ")) {
310:       operations.push({ type: "update", path: /* path */, update: "", added: 0, deleted: 0 });
311:     } else if (operations.length > 0) {
312:       // 4. If inside an operation, parse the content/diff lines (+/-)
313:       const lastOp = operations[operations.length - 1];
314:       // ... add line content to create/update operation ...
315:     } else {
316:       // Invalid line outside of an operation
317:       return null;
318:     }
319:   }
320: 
321:   return operations; // Return the list of parsed operations
322: }
323: ```
324: 
325: This parser specifically understands the `*** Add File:`, `*** Delete File:`, `*** Update File:` markers and the `+`/`-` lines within patches to figure out exactly which files to change and how.
326: 
327: ### Displaying Tool Calls (`terminal-chat-response-item.tsx`)
328: 
329: The UI needs to show tool calls differently from regular messages.
330: 
331: ```tsx
332: // File: codex-cli/src/components/chat/terminal-chat-response-item.tsx (Simplified)
333: import { parseToolCall } from "../../utils/parsers";
334: // ... other imports: Box, Text from ink ...
335: 
336: export default function TerminalChatResponseItem({ item }: { item: ResponseItem }): React.ReactElement {
337:   switch (item.type) {
338:     case "message":
339:       // ... render regular message ...
340:       break;
341:     case "function_call": // <-- Handle tool calls
342:       return <TerminalChatResponseToolCall message={item} />;
343:     case "function_call_output":
344:       // ... render tool output ...
345:       break;
346:     // ... other cases ...
347:   }
348:   // ... fallback ...
349: }
350: 
351: function TerminalChatResponseToolCall({ message }: { message: ResponseFunctionToolCallItem }) {
352:   // Use the parser to get displayable details
353:   const details = parseToolCall(message); // From parsers.ts
354: 
355:   if (!details) return <Text color="red">Invalid tool call</Text>;
356: 
357:   return (
358:     <Box flexDirection="column">
359:       <Text color="magentaBright" bold>command</Text>
360:       {/* Display the nicely formatted command */}
361:       <Text><Text dimColor>$</Text> {details.cmdReadableText}</Text>
362:     </Box>
363:   );
364: }
365: ```
366: 
367: *   The main component checks the `item.type`.
368: *   If it's `function_call`, it renders a specific component (`TerminalChatResponseToolCall`).
369: *   This component uses `parseToolCall` (from `utils/parsers.ts`) to get the details and displays the command in a distinct style (e.g., with a `$` prefix and magenta color).
370: 
371: ## Conclusion
372: 
373: You've now seen how Codex acts as an interpreter for the AI. It doesn't just receive text; it receives structured instructions. The **Response & Tool Call Handling** system is responsible for parsing these instructions, figuring out if the AI wants to use a tool (like `shell` or `apply_patch`), and extracting the precise arguments needed for that tool. This crucial step translates the AI's intentions into actionable details that Codex can then use to interact with your system, always respecting the rules set by the [Approval Policy & Security](04_approval_policy___security.md).
374: 
375: Now that Codex understands *what* command the AI wants to run (e.g., `git status`), how does it actually *execute* that command safely, especially if running in `full-auto` mode? That's the topic of our next chapter.

  8: # Chapter 6: Command Execution & Sandboxing
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](05_response___tool_call_handling.md), we learned how Codex listens to the AI and understands when it wants to use a tool, like running a specific shell command (`git status` or `npm install`). We also know from the [Approval Policy & Security](04_approval_policy___security.md) chapter that Codex checks if it *should* run the command based on your chosen safety level.
 11: 
 12: But once Codex has the command and permission (either from you or automatically), how does it actually *run* that command? And how does it do it safely, especially if you've given it more freedom in `full-auto` mode?
 13: 
 14: That's the job of the **Command Execution & Sandboxing** system.
 15: 
 16: ## What's the Big Idea? The Workshop Safety Zones
 17: 
 18: Imagine Codex is working in a workshop. This system is like the different areas and safety procedures in that workshop:
 19: 
 20: *   **The Main Workbench (Raw Execution):** For simple, safe tasks (like running `ls` to list files), Codex might just use the tools directly on the main workbench. It's straightforward, but you wouldn't use dangerous chemicals there.
 21: *   **The Safety Cage (Sandboxing):** For potentially risky tasks (like testing a powerful new tool, or maybe running a command the AI suggested that you haven't manually approved in `full-auto` mode), Codex moves the work inside a special safety cage. This cage has reinforced walls and maybe limited power outlets, preventing any accidents from affecting the rest of the workshop.
 22: 
 23: This system takes a command requested by the AI (like `python script.py` or `git commit -m "AI commit"`) and actually runs it on your computer's command line. Crucially, it decides *whether* to run it directly (on the workbench) or inside a restricted environment (the safety cage or "sandbox"). It also collects the results – what the command printed (output/stdout), any errors (stderr), and whether it finished successfully (exit code).
 24: 
 25: ## Key Concepts
 26: 
 27: 1.  **Raw Execution:**
 28:     *   **What:** Running the command directly using your system's shell, just like you would type it.
 29:     *   **When:** Used for commands deemed safe, or when you explicitly approve a command in `suggest` or `auto-edit` mode.
 30:     *   **Pros:** Simple, has full access to your environment (which might be needed).
 31:     *   **Cons:** If the AI makes a mistake and suggests a harmful command, running it raw could cause problems.
 32: 
 33: 2.  **Sandboxing:**
 34:     *   **What:** Running the command inside a restricted environment that limits what it can do. Think of it as putting the command in "jail."
 35:     *   **How (Examples):**
 36:         *   **macOS Seatbelt:** Uses a built-in macOS feature (`sandbox-exec`) with a specific policy file to strictly control what the command can access (e.g., only allow writing to the project folder, block network access).
 37:         *   **Docker Container:** Runs the command inside a lightweight container (like the one defined in `codex-cli/Dockerfile`). This container has only specific tools installed and can have network rules applied (using `iptables`/`ipset` via `init_firewall.sh`) to limit internet access.
 38:     *   **When:** Typically used automatically in `full-auto` mode (as decided by the [Approval Policy & Security](04_approval_policy___security.md) check), or potentially if a specific command is flagged as needing extra caution.
 39:     *   **Pros:** Significantly reduces the risk of accidental damage from faulty or malicious commands suggested by the AI.
 40:     *   **Cons:** Might prevent a command from working if it legitimately needs access to something the sandbox blocks (like a specific system file or network resource). The setup can be more complex.
 41: 
 42: ## How It Works: From Approval to Execution
 43: 
 44: The Command Execution system doesn't decide *whether* to run a command – that's the job of the [Approval Policy & Security](04_approval_policy___security.md). This system comes into play *after* the approval check.
 45: 
 46: Remember the `handleExecCommand` function from the [Agent Loop](03_agent_loop.md) chapter? It first calls `canAutoApprove` ([Approval Policy & Security](04_approval_policy___security.md)). If the command is approved (either by policy or by you), `canAutoApprove` tells `handleExecCommand` *whether* sandboxing is needed (`runInSandbox: true` or `runInSandbox: false`).
 47: 
 48: ```typescript
 49: // File: codex-cli/src/utils/agent/handle-exec-command.ts (Simplified Snippet)
 50: 
 51: import { execCommand } from "./exec-command-helper"; // (Conceptual helper name)
 52: import { getSandbox } from "./sandbox-selector"; // (Conceptual helper name)
 53: // ... other imports: canAutoApprove, config, policy types ...
 54: 
 55: async function handleExecCommand(
 56:   args: ExecInput, // Contains { cmd: ["git", "status"], ... }
 57:   config: AppConfig,
 58:   policy: ApprovalPolicy,
 59:   getCommandConfirmation: (/*...*/) => Promise<CommandConfirmation>,
 60:   // ... abortSignal ...
 61: ): Promise<HandleExecCommandResult> {
 62: 
 63:   // 1. Check policy (calls canAutoApprove)
 64:   const safety = canAutoApprove(command, policy, [process.cwd()]);
 65:   let runInSandbox: boolean;
 66: 
 67:   // 2. Determine if approved and if sandbox needed
 68:   switch (safety.type) {
 69:     case "ask-user":
 70:       // Ask user via getCommandConfirmation...
 71:       // If approved, runInSandbox = false;
 72:       break;
 73:     case "auto-approve":
 74:       runInSandbox = safety.runInSandbox; // Get sandbox flag from policy check
 75:       break;
 76:     // ... handle reject ...
 77:   }
 78: 
 79:   // 3. *** Execute the command! ***
 80:   // Determine the actual sandbox mechanism (Seatbelt, Docker, None)
 81:   const sandboxType = await getSandbox(runInSandbox);
 82:   // Call the function that handles execution
 83:   const summary = await execCommand(
 84:     args,
 85:     applyPatch, // (if it was an apply_patch command)
 86:     sandboxType,
 87:     abortSignal,
 88:   );
 89: 
 90:   // 4. Format and return results
 91:   return convertSummaryToResult(summary);
 92: }
 93: ```
 94: 
 95: *   **Steps 1 & 2:** Approval policy is checked, maybe the user is asked. We get the `runInSandbox` boolean.
 96: *   **Step 3:** A helper (`getSandbox`) determines the specific `SandboxType` (e.g., `MACOS_SEATBELT` or `NONE`) based on `runInSandbox` and the operating system. Then, the core execution function (`execCommand`) is called, passing the command details and the chosen `sandboxType`.
 97: *   **Step 4:** The results (stdout, stderr, exit code) from `execCommand` are packaged up.
 98: 
 99: ## Under the Hood: Running the Command

101: Let's trace the execution flow:

135: 
136: ### The Entry Point: `exec.ts`
137: 
138: This file acts as a router. It takes the command and the desired `SandboxType` and calls the appropriate execution function.
139: 
140: ```typescript
141: // File: codex-cli/src/utils/agent/exec.ts (Simplified)
142: import type { ExecInput, ExecResult, SandboxType } from "./sandbox/interface.js";
143: import { execWithSeatbelt } from "./sandbox/macos-seatbelt.js";
144: import { exec as rawExec } from "./sandbox/raw-exec.js";
145: // ... other imports like process_patch for apply_patch ...
146: 
147: // Never rejects, maps errors to non-zero exit code / stderr
148: export function exec(
149:   { cmd, workdir, timeoutInMillis }: ExecInput,
150:   sandbox: SandboxType, // e.g., NONE, MACOS_SEATBELT
151:   abortSignal?: AbortSignal,
152: ): Promise<ExecResult> {
153: 
154:   // Decide which execution function to use
155:   const execFunction =
156:     sandbox === SandboxType.MACOS_SEATBELT ? execWithSeatbelt : rawExec;
157: 
158:   const opts: SpawnOptions = { /* ... set timeout, workdir ... */ };
159:   const writableRoots = [process.cwd(), os.tmpdir()]; // Basic allowed paths
160: 
161:   // Call the chosen function (either raw or sandboxed)
162:   return execFunction(cmd, opts, writableRoots, abortSignal);
163: }
164: 
165: // Special handler for apply_patch pseudo-command
166: export function execApplyPatch(patchText: string): ExecResult {
167:   try {
168:     // Use file system operations directly (fs.writeFileSync etc.)
169:     const result = process_patch(/* ... patchText, fs functions ... */);
170:     return { stdout: result, stderr: "", exitCode: 0 };
171:   } catch (error: unknown) {
172:     // Handle errors during patching
173:     return { stdout: "", stderr: String(error), exitCode: 1 };
174:   }
175: }
176: ```
177: 
178: *   It receives the command (`cmd`), options (`workdir`, `timeout`), and the `sandbox` type.
179: *   It checks the `sandbox` type and chooses either `execWithSeatbelt` (for macOS sandbox) or `rawExec` (for direct execution).
180: *   It calls the selected function.
181: *   Note: `apply_patch` is handled specially by `execApplyPatch`, which directly uses Node.js file system functions instead of spawning a shell command.
182: 
183: ### Raw Execution: `raw-exec.ts`
184: 
185: This function runs the command directly using Node.js's built-in `child_process.spawn`.
186: 
187: ```typescript
188: // File: codex-cli/src/utils/agent/sandbox/raw-exec.ts (Simplified)
189: import type { ExecResult } from "./interface";
190: import { spawn, type SpawnOptions } from "child_process";
191: import { log, isLoggingEnabled } from "../log.js";
192: 
193: const MAX_BUFFER = 1024 * 100; // 100 KB limit for stdout/stderr
194: 
195: // Never rejects, maps errors to non-zero exit code / stderr
196: export function exec(
197:   command: Array<string>, // e.g., ["git", "status"]
198:   options: SpawnOptions,
199:   _writableRoots: Array<string>, // Not used in raw exec
200:   abortSignal?: AbortSignal,
201: ): Promise<ExecResult> {
202:   const prog = command[0];
203:   const args = command.slice(1);
204: 
205:   return new Promise<ExecResult>((resolve) => {
206:     // Spawn the child process
207:     const child = spawn(prog, args, {
208:       ...options,
209:       stdio: ["ignore", "pipe", "pipe"], // Don't wait for stdin, capture stdout/err
210:       detached: true, // Allows killing process group on abort
211:     });
212: 
213:     // Handle abort signal if provided
214:     if (abortSignal) {
215:        // Add listener to kill child process if aborted
216:        // ... abort handling logic ...
217:     }
218: 
219:     let stdout = "";
220:     let stderr = "";
221:     // Capture stdout/stderr, respecting MAX_BUFFER limit
222:     child.stdout?.on("data", (data) => { /* append to stdout if under limit */ });
223:     child.stderr?.on("data", (data) => { /* append to stderr if under limit */ });
224: 
225:     // Handle process exit
226:     child.on("exit", (code, signal) => {
227:       resolve({ stdout, stderr, exitCode: code ?? 1 });
228:     });
229: 
230:     // Handle errors like "command not found"
231:     child.on("error", (err) => {
232:       resolve({ stdout: "", stderr: String(err), exitCode: 1 });
233:     });
234:   });
235: }
236: ```
237: 
238: *   It uses `child_process.spawn` to run the command. `spawn` is generally safer than `exec` as it doesn't involve an intermediate shell unless explicitly requested.
239: *   It captures `stdout` and `stderr` data, enforcing a maximum buffer size to prevent memory issues.
240: *   It listens for the `exit` event to get the exit code.
241: *   It listens for the `error` event (e.g., if the command executable doesn't exist).
242: *   It includes logic to kill the child process if the `abortSignal` is triggered (e.g., user presses Ctrl+C).
243: *   Crucially, it always `resolve`s the promise, even on errors, packaging the error into the `ExecResult`.
244: 
245: ### Sandboxing on macOS: `macos-seatbelt.ts`
246: 
247: This function wraps the command execution using macOS's `sandbox-exec` tool.
248: 
249: ```typescript
250: // File: codex-cli/src/utils/agent/sandbox/macos-seatbelt.ts (Simplified)
251: import type { ExecResult } from "./interface.js";
252: import { exec as rawExec } from "./raw-exec.js"; // Uses raw exec internally!
253: import { log } from "../log.js";
254: 
255: const READ_ONLY_POLICY_BASE = `
256: (version 1)
257: (deny default)
258: (allow file-read*) ; Allow reading most things
259: (allow process-exec process-fork signal) ; Allow running/forking
260: (allow sysctl-read) ; Allow reading system info
261: ; ... more base rules ...
262: `;
263: 
264: // Runs command inside macOS Seatbelt sandbox
265: export function execWithSeatbelt(
266:   cmd: Array<string>, // The original command e.g., ["python", "script.py"]
267:   opts: SpawnOptions,
268:   writableRoots: Array<string>, // Dirs allowed for writing, e.g., project root
269:   abortSignal?: AbortSignal,
270: ): Promise<ExecResult> {
271: 
272:   // 1. Build the sandbox policy string
273:   let policy = READ_ONLY_POLICY_BASE;
274:   let policyParams: Array<string> = [];
275:   if (writableRoots.length > 0) {
276:     // Add rules to allow writing ONLY within specified roots
277:     const writeRules = writableRoots.map(
278:       (root, i) => `(allow file-write* (subpath (param "WR_${i}")))`
279:     ).join("\n");
280:     policy += `\n${writeRules}`;
281:     // Create parameters for sandbox-exec
282:     policyParams = writableRoots.map((root, i) => `-DWR_${i}=${root}`);
283:   }
284:   log(`Seatbelt Policy: ${policy}`);
285: 
286:   // 2. Construct the actual command to run: sandbox-exec + policy + original command
287:   const fullCommand = [
288:     "sandbox-exec",
289:     "-p", policy, // Pass the policy string
290:     ...policyParams, // Pass parameters like -DWR_0=/path/to/project
291:     "--", // End of sandbox-exec options
292:     ...cmd, // The original command and arguments
293:   ];
294: 
295:   // 3. Execute the `sandbox-exec` command using rawExec
296:   return rawExec(fullCommand, opts, [], abortSignal); // writableRoots not needed by rawExec here
297: }
298: ```
299: 
300: *   It defines a base Seatbelt policy (`.sb` file format) that denies most actions by default but allows basic read operations and process execution.
301: *   It dynamically adds `allow file-write*` rules for the specific `writableRoots` provided (usually the project directory and temp directories).
302: *   It constructs a new command line that starts with `sandbox-exec`, passes the generated policy (`-p`), passes parameters defining the writable roots (`-D`), and finally appends the original command.
303: *   It then calls `rawExec` to run this *entire* `sandbox-exec ... -- original-command ...` line. The operating system handles enforcing the sandbox rules.
304: 
305: ### Sandboxing with Docker: `Dockerfile`
306: 
307: Another approach, often used on Linux or as a fallback, is Docker. The `Dockerfile` defines the restricted environment.
308: 
309: ```dockerfile
310: # File: codex-cli/Dockerfile (Simplified Snippets)
311: 
312: # Start from a basic Node.js image
313: FROM node:20
314: 
315: # Install only necessary tools (git, jq, rg, maybe python/bash, etc.)
316: # Avoid installing powerful tools unless absolutely needed.
317: RUN apt update && apt install -y \
318:   git jq ripgrep sudo iproute2 iptables ipset \
319:   # ... other minimal tools ...
320:   && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
321: 
322: # Copy codex itself into the container
323: COPY dist/codex.tgz codex.tgz
324: RUN npm install -g codex.tgz
325: 
326: # Setup non-root user
327: USER node
328: WORKDIR /home/node/workspace # Work happens here
329: 
330: # Copy and set up firewall script (runs via sudo)
331: # This script uses iptables/ipset to block network access by default,
332: # potentially allowing only specific domains if configured.
333: COPY scripts/init_firewall.sh /usr/local/bin/
334: USER root
335: RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/init_firewall.sh && \
336:   # Allow 'node' user to run firewall script via sudo without password
337:   echo "node ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/init_firewall.sh" > /etc/sudoers.d/node-firewall
338: USER node
339: 
340: # Default command when container starts (might be codex or just a shell)
341: # ENTRYPOINT ["codex"]
342: ```
343: 
344: *   **Minimal Tools:** The Docker image includes only a limited set of command-line tools, reducing the potential attack surface.
345: *   **Non-Root User:** Commands run as a non-privileged user (`node`) inside the container.
346: *   **Workspace:** Work typically happens in a specific directory (e.g., `/home/node/workspace`), often mapped to your project directory on the host machine.
347: *   **Network Firewall:** An `init_firewall.sh` script (run via `sudo` at startup or when needed) configures `iptables` to restrict network access. This prevents sandboxed commands from easily calling out to arbitrary internet addresses.
348: *   **Usage:** Codex might be run *entirely* within this container, or it might invoke commands *inside* this container from the outside using `docker exec`.
349: 
350: ## Conclusion
351: 
352: You've reached the end of the workshop tour! The **Command Execution & Sandboxing** system is Codex's way of actually *doing* things on the command line when instructed by the AI. It carefully considers the safety level decided by the [Approval Policy & Security](04_approval_policy___security.md) and chooses the right execution method: direct "raw" execution for trusted commands, or running inside a protective "sandbox" (like macOS Seatbelt or a Docker container) for potentially riskier operations, especially in `full-auto` mode. This layered approach allows Codex to be powerful while providing crucial safety mechanisms against unintended consequences.
353: 
354: We've seen how Codex handles input, talks to the AI, checks policies, and executes commands. But how does Codex know *which* AI model to use, what your API key is, or which approval mode you prefer? All these settings need to be managed.

  8: # Chapter 7: Configuration Management
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](06_command_execution___sandboxing.md), we saw how Codex carefully executes commands, using sandboxing for safety when needed. But how does Codex remember your preferences between sessions? For instance, how does it know which AI model you like to use, or whether you prefer `auto-edit` mode? And how can you give Codex persistent instructions about how you want it to behave?
 11: 
 12: This is where **Configuration Management** comes in. Think of it like the settings menu or preferences file for Codex.
 13: 
 14: ## What's the Big Idea? Remembering Your Settings
 15: 
 16: Imagine you prefer using the powerful `gpt-4o` model instead of the default `o4-mini`. Or perhaps you always want Codex to follow a specific coding style or avoid using certain commands unless you explicitly ask. It would be annoying to tell Codex this *every single time* you run it using command-line flags like `--model gpt-4o`.
 17: 
 18: Configuration Management solves this by allowing Codex to:
 19: 
 20: 1.  **Load Default Settings:** Read a special file to know your preferred model, default [Approval Policy](04_approval_policy___security.md) mode, etc.
 21: 2.  **Load Custom Instructions:** Read other special files containing your personal guidelines or project-specific rules for the AI.
 22: 
 23: This way, Codex behaves consistently according to your setup without needing constant reminders. It's like setting up your favorite text editor with your preferred theme and plugins – you do it once, and it remembers.
 24: 
 25: ## Key Concepts
 26: 
 27: 1.  **Configuration File (`config.yaml`)**:
 28:     *   **Where:** Lives in your home directory, inside a hidden folder: `~/.codex/config.yaml` (it might also be `.json` or `.yml`).
 29:     *   **What:** Stores your default settings. The most common setting is the AI `model` you want Codex to use. You can also set things like the default error handling behavior in `full-auto` mode (`fullAutoErrorMode`).
 30:     *   **Format:** Usually written in YAML (or JSON), which is a simple, human-readable format.
 31: 
 32: 2.  **Instruction Files (`instructions.md`, `codex.md`)**:
 33:     *   **Where:**
 34:         *   **Global:** `~/.codex/instructions.md` - These instructions apply every time you run Codex, anywhere on your system.
 35:         *   **Project-Specific:** `codex.md` (or `.codex.md`) - Placed in the root directory of your code project (or sometimes in subdirectories). These instructions apply only when you run Codex within that specific project.
 36:     *   **What:** Contain text instructions (written in Markdown) that guide the AI's behavior. Think of it as giving your AI assistant standing orders.
 37:     *   **Format:** Plain Markdown text.
 38: 
 39: 3.  **Loading Order:** Codex combines these instructions intelligently:
 40:     *   It first reads the global instructions (`~/.codex/instructions.md`).
 41:     *   Then, if it finds a project-specific `codex.md` in your current working directory (or its parent Git repository root), it adds those instructions too. This lets project-specific rules override or add to your global ones.
 42: 
 43: ## How to Use It: Setting Your Preferences
 44: 
 45: Let's make Codex always use `gpt-4o` and give it a global instruction.
 46: 
 47: **1. Set the Default Model:**
 48: 
 49: Create or edit the file `~/.codex/config.yaml` (you might need to create the `.codex` directory first). Add the following content:
 50: 
 51: ```yaml
 52: # File: ~/.codex/config.yaml
 53: 
 54: # Use the gpt-4o model by default for all Codex runs
 55: model: gpt-4o
 56: 
 57: # Optional: How to handle errors when running commands in full-auto
 58: # fullAutoErrorMode: ask-user # (Default) Ask user what to do
 59: # fullAutoErrorMode: ignore-and-continue # Don't stop on error
 60: ```
 61: 
 62: *   **Explanation:** This simple YAML file tells Codex that your preferred `model` is `gpt-4o`. Now, you don't need to type `--model gpt-4o` every time!
 63: 
 64: **2. Add Global Instructions:**
 65: 
 66: Create or edit the file `~/.codex/instructions.md`. Add some guidelines:
 67: 
 68: ```markdown
 69: # File: ~/.codex/instructions.md
 70: 
 71: - Always explain your reasoning step-by-step before suggesting code or commands.
 72: - Prefer using Python for scripting tasks unless otherwise specified.
 73: - Use emojis in your responses! 🎉
 74: ```
 75: 
 76: *   **Explanation:** This Markdown file gives the AI assistant general rules to follow during *any* conversation.
 77: 
 78: **3. (Optional) Add Project Instructions:**
 79: 
 80: Navigate to your project's root directory (e.g., `~/my-cool-project/`) and create a file named `codex.md`:
 81: 
 82: ```markdown
 83: # File: ~/my-cool-project/codex.md
 84: 
 85: - This project uses TypeScript and adheres to the Prettier style guide.
 86: - When adding new features, always include unit tests using Jest.
 87: - Do not run `git push` directly; always suggest creating a pull request.
 88: ```
 89: 
 90: *   **Explanation:** When you run `codex` inside `~/my-cool-project/`, the AI will get *both* the global instructions *and* these project-specific ones.
 91: 
 92: Now, when you run `codex` (without any flags overriding these settings), it will automatically:
 93: 
 94: *   Use the `gpt-4o` model.
 95: *   Receive the combined instructions (global + project-specific, if applicable) to guide its responses and actions.
 96: 
 97: You can disable loading the project `codex.md` file by using the `--no-project-doc` flag if needed.
 98: 
 99: ## Under the Hood: How Codex Loads Configuration
100: 
101: When you start the Codex CLI, one of the first things it does is figure out its configuration.
102: 
103: ```mermaid
104: sequenceDiagram
105:     participant CLI as Codex CLI Process
106:     participant ConfigLoader as config.ts (loadConfig)
107:     participant FileSystem as Your Computer's Files
108: 
109:     CLI->>ConfigLoader: Start: Call loadConfig()
110:     ConfigLoader->>FileSystem: Check for ~/.codex/config.yaml (or .json, .yml)?
111:     FileSystem-->>ConfigLoader: Found config.yaml
112:     ConfigLoader->>FileSystem: Read ~/.codex/config.yaml
113:     FileSystem-->>ConfigLoader: YAML content (e.g., model: gpt-4o)
114:     ConfigLoader->>ConfigLoader: Parse YAML, store model='gpt-4o'
115:     ConfigLoader->>FileSystem: Check for ~/.codex/instructions.md?
116:     FileSystem-->>ConfigLoader: Found instructions.md
117:     ConfigLoader->>FileSystem: Read ~/.codex/instructions.md
118:     FileSystem-->>ConfigLoader: Global instructions text
119:     ConfigLoader->>FileSystem: Check for project 'codex.md' (discoverProjectDocPath)?
120:     FileSystem-->>ConfigLoader: Found project/codex.md
121:     ConfigLoader->>FileSystem: Read project/codex.md
122:     FileSystem-->>ConfigLoader: Project instructions text
123:     ConfigLoader->>ConfigLoader: Combine global + project instructions
124:     ConfigLoader-->>CLI: Return AppConfig object { model, instructions }
125:     CLI->>CLI: Use AppConfig for AgentLoop, etc.
126: ```
127: 
128: 1.  **Start:** The main CLI process (`cli.tsx`) starts up.
129: 2.  **Load Config:** It calls the `loadConfig` function (from `utils/config.ts`).
130: 3.  **Read Settings:** `loadConfig` looks for `~/.codex/config.yaml` (or `.json`/`.yml`). If found, it reads the file, parses the YAML/JSON, and stores the settings (like `model`). If not found, it uses defaults (like `o4-mini`).
131: 4.  **Read Global Instructions:** It looks for `~/.codex/instructions.md`. If found, it reads the content.
132: 5.  **Find Project Instructions:** It calls helper functions like `discoverProjectDocPath` to search the current directory and parent directories (up to the Git root) for a `codex.md` file.
133: 6.  **Read Project Instructions:** If `codex.md` is found, it reads the content.
134: 7.  **Combine:** `loadConfig` concatenates the global and project instructions (if any) into a single string.
135: 8.  **Return:** It returns an `AppConfig` object containing the final model choice, the combined instructions, and other settings.
136: 9.  **Use Config:** The CLI process then uses this `AppConfig` object when setting up the [Agent Loop](03_agent_loop.md) and other parts of the application.
137: 
138: ## Diving into Code (`config.ts`)
139: 
140: The magic happens mainly in `codex-cli/src/utils/config.ts`.
141: 
142: Here's how the CLI entry point (`cli.tsx`) uses `loadConfig`:
143: 
144: ```typescript
145: // File: codex-cli/src/cli.tsx (Simplified)
146: 
147: import { loadConfig } from "./utils/config";
148: import App from "./app";
149: // ... other imports: React, render, meow ...
150: 
151: // --- Get command line arguments ---
152: const cli = meow(/* ... cli setup ... */);
153: const prompt = cli.input[0];
154: const modelOverride = cli.flags.model; // e.g., --model gpt-4
155: 
156: // --- Load Configuration ---
157: // loadConfig handles reading files and combining instructions
158: let config = loadConfig(
159:   undefined, // Use default config file paths
160:   undefined, // Use default instructions file paths
161:   {
162:     cwd: process.cwd(), // Where are we running from? (for project docs)
163:     disableProjectDoc: Boolean(cli.flags.noProjectDoc), // Did user pass --no-project-doc?
164:     projectDocPath: cli.flags.projectDoc as string | undefined, // Explicit project doc?
165:   }
166: );
167: 
168: // --- Apply Overrides ---
169: // Command-line flags take precedence over config file settings
170: config = {
171:   ...config, // Start with loaded config
172:   model: modelOverride ?? config.model, // Use flag model if provided, else keep loaded one
173:   apiKey: process.env["OPENAI_API_KEY"] || "", // Get API key from environment
174: };
175: 
176: // --- Check Model Support ---
177: // ... check if config.model is valid ...
178: 
179: // --- Render the App ---
180: // Pass the final, combined config object to the main UI component
181: const instance = render(
182:   <App
183:     prompt={prompt}
184:     config={config} // Use the loaded and merged configuration
185:     // ... other props: approvalPolicy, etc. ...
186:   />,
187: );
188: ```
189: 
190: *   **Explanation:** The code first calls `loadConfig`, passing options related to finding the project `codex.md`. It then merges these loaded settings with any overrides provided via command-line flags (like `--model`). The final `config` object is passed to the main React `<App>` component.
191: 
192: Inside `config.ts`, the loading logic looks something like this:
193: 
194: ```typescript
195: // File: codex-cli/src/utils/config.ts (Simplified)
196: 
197: import { existsSync, readFileSync } from "fs";
198: import { load as loadYaml } from "js-yaml";
199: import { homedir } from "os";
200: import { join, dirname, resolve as resolvePath } from "path";
201: 
202: export const CONFIG_DIR = join(homedir(), ".codex");
203: export const CONFIG_YAML_FILEPATH = join(CONFIG_DIR, "config.yaml");
204: // ... other paths: .json, .yml, instructions.md ...
205: export const DEFAULT_AGENTIC_MODEL = "o4-mini";
206: 
207: // Represents full runtime config
208: export type AppConfig = {
209:   apiKey?: string;
210:   model: string;
211:   instructions: string;
212:   // ... other settings ...
213: };

294:   return /* path or null */;
295: }
296: ```
297: 
298: *   **Explanation:** `loadConfig` reads the YAML/JSON config file, reads the global `instructions.md`, uses helpers like `loadProjectDoc` and `discoverProjectDocPath` to find and read the project-specific `codex.md`, combines the instructions, determines the final model name (using defaults if necessary), and returns everything in a structured `AppConfig` object.
299: 
300: ## Conclusion
301: 
302: Configuration Management makes Codex much more convenient and personalized. By reading settings from `~/.codex/config.yaml` and instructions from `~/.codex/instructions.md` and project-specific `codex.md` files, it remembers your preferences (like your favorite AI model) and follows your standing orders without you needing to repeat them every time. This allows for a smoother and more consistent interaction tailored to your workflow and project needs.
303: 
304: So far, we've mostly seen Codex working interactively in a chat-like loop. But what if you want Codex to perform a task and exit, perhaps as part of a script?

  8: # Chapter 8: Single-Pass Mode
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](07_configuration_management.md), we explored how Codex uses configuration files to remember your preferences and follow custom instructions. We've mostly seen Codex operate in its default interactive mode, like having a conversation in the [Terminal UI](01_terminal_ui__ink_components_.md) where the [Agent Loop](03_agent_loop.md) goes back and forth with the AI.
 11: 
 12: But what if you have a task that's very clearly defined? Imagine you want to rename a function across your entire project. You know exactly what needs to be done, and you don't really need a back-and-forth chat. Wouldn't it be faster if you could just give Codex the instructions and have it figure out *all* the necessary changes at once?
 13: 
 14: That's exactly the idea behind **Single-Pass Mode**.
 15: 
 16: ## What's the Big Idea? The Architect Analogy
 17: 
 18: Think about building a house. The normal, interactive mode of Codex is like having a conversation with your architect room by room: "Let's design the kitchen." "Okay, now how about the living room?" "Should we add a window here?". It's collaborative and allows for adjustments along the way.
 19: 
 20: **Single-Pass Mode** is different. It's like giving the architect the complete blueprints, all the requirements, and the site survey *upfront*, and asking them to come back with the *final, complete building plan* in one go.
 21: 
 22: In this experimental mode, Codex tries to:
 23: 
 24: 1.  Gather a large amount of context about your project (lots of code files).
 25: 2.  Send your request *and* all that context to the AI model *at the same time*.
 26: 3.  Ask the AI to generate a *complete set* of file operations (creations, updates, deletions) needed to fulfill your request, all in a single response.
 27: 4.  Show you the proposed changes for review.
 28: 5.  If you approve, apply all the changes and exit.
 29: 
 30: This mode aims for efficiency, especially on larger, well-defined tasks where you're reasonably confident the AI can generate the full solution without needing clarification.
 31: 
 32: ## Key Concepts
 33: 
 34: 1.  **Full Context (Within Limits):** Instead of just looking at one or two files, Codex gathers the content of many files in your project (respecting ignore rules from [Configuration Management](07_configuration_management.md) and size limits like `MAX_CONTEXT_CHARACTER_LIMIT`). This gives the AI a broader view of your codebase.
 35: 2.  **Single Structured Response:** The AI isn't just asked for text. It's specifically instructed to respond with a structured list of *all* the file operations required. Codex uses a predefined schema (like `EditedFilesSchema` defined using Zod in `file_ops.ts`) to tell the AI exactly how to format this list.
 36: 3.  **All-or-Nothing Confirmation:** You are presented with a summary and a diff (showing additions and deletions) of *all* the proposed changes across all affected files. You then give a single "Yes" or "No" to apply everything or nothing.
 37: 4.  **Efficiency for Defined Tasks:** This mode shines when your instructions are clear and the task doesn't likely require interactive refinement (e.g., "Rename function X to Y everywhere", "Add logging to every public method in class Z").
 38: 
 39: ## How to Use It
 40: 
 41: You typically invoke single-pass mode using a specific command-line flag when running Codex (the exact flag might vary, but let's assume `--single-pass`).
 42: 
 43: **Example:**
 44: 
 45: Let's say you want to rename a function `calculate_total` to `compute_grand_total` throughout your project located in `~/my-sales-app/`.
 46: 
 47: ```bash
 48: cd ~/my-sales-app/
 49: codex --single-pass "Rename the function 'calculate_total' to 'compute_grand_total' in all project files."
 50: ```
 51: 
 52: **What Happens:**
 53: 
 54: 1.  **Context Loading:** Codex will identify the files in `~/my-sales-app/` (respecting ignores), read their content, and note the size. You might see output indicating this.
 55: 2.  **AI Thinking:** It sends your prompt and the file contents to the AI, asking for the complete set of changes. You'll likely see a spinner.
 56: 3.  **Review:** Codex receives the proposed file operations from the AI. It calculates the differences (diffs) and shows you a summary:
 57:     ```
 58:     Summary:
 59:       Modified: src/utils.py (+1/-1)
 60:       Modified: tests/test_utils.py (+1/-1)
 61:       Modified: main_app.py (+1/-1)
 62: 
 63:     Proposed Diffs:
 64:     ================================================================================
 65:     Changes for: src/utils.py
 66:     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 75: 
 76:     Apply these changes? [y/N]
 77:     ```
 78: 4.  **Confirmation:** You type `y` and press Enter.
 79: 5.  **Applying:** Codex modifies the files `src/utils.py`, `tests/test_utils.py`, and `main_app.py` according to the diffs.

 84: ## Under the Hood: The Single-Pass Flow
 85: 
 86: Let's trace the journey when you run `codex --single-pass "prompt"`:

 91:     participant CLI as Codex CLI (SinglePass)

107:     CLI->>User: Displays summary & diffs, asks "Apply changes? [y/N]"

110:     CLI->>User: Shows "Changes applied." message
111:     CLI->>CLI: Exits
112: ```
113: 
114: 1.  **Invocation:** The CLI (`cli_singlepass.tsx`) is started in single-pass mode.
115: 2.  **Context Gathering:** It uses functions like `getFileContents` from `utils/singlepass/context_files.ts` to read the content of project files, respecting ignore patterns and size limits.
116: 3.  **Prompt Construction:** It builds a large prompt using `renderTaskContext` from `utils/singlepass/context.ts`. This prompt includes your request and embeds the content of all gathered files, often in an XML-like format.
117: 4.  **AI Call:** It sends this single, massive prompt to the OpenAI API. Crucially, it tells the API to format the response according to a specific structure (`EditedFilesSchema` from `utils/singlepass/file_ops.ts`) which expects a list of file operations.
118: 5.  **Response Parsing:** The CLI receives the response and uses the `EditedFilesSchema` to parse the expected list of operations (create file, update file content, delete file, move file).
119: 6.  **Diffing & Summary:** It uses helpers like `generateDiffSummary` and `generateEditSummary` from `utils/singlepass/code_diff.ts` to compare the proposed `updated_full_content` for each operation against the original file content, generating human-readable diffs and a summary.
120: 7.  **Confirmation:** The main application component (`SinglePassApp` in `components/singlepass-cli-app.tsx`) displays the summary and diffs using Ink components and prompts the user for confirmation (`ConfirmationPrompt`).
121: 8.  **Application:** If confirmed, the `applyFileOps` function iterates through the parsed operations and uses Node.js's `fs.promises` module (`fsPromises.writeFile`, `fsPromises.unlink`, etc.) to modify the files on disk.
122: 9.  **Exit:** The application cleans up and exits.
123: 
124: ## Diving into Code
125: 
126: Let's look at the key parts involved.
127: 
128: ### Starting Single-Pass Mode (`cli_singlepass.tsx`)
129: 
130: This module likely provides the entry point function called by the main CLI when the `--single-pass` flag is detected.
131: 
132: ```typescript
133: // File: codex-cli/src/cli_singlepass.tsx (Simplified)
134: import type { AppConfig } from "./utils/config";
135: import { SinglePassApp } from "./components/singlepass-cli-app";
136: import { render } from "ink";
137: import React from "react";
138: 
139: // This function is called by the main CLI logic
140: export async function runSinglePass({
141:   originalPrompt, // The user's request string
142:   config,         // Loaded configuration (model, instructions)
143:   rootPath,       // The project directory
144: }: { /* ... */ }): Promise<void> {
145:   return new Promise((resolve) => {
146:     // Render the dedicated Ink UI for single-pass mode
147:     render(
148:       <SinglePassApp
149:         originalPrompt={originalPrompt}
150:         config={config}
151:         rootPath={rootPath}
152:         onExit={() => resolve()} // Callback when the app is done
153:       />,
154:     );
155:   });
156: }
157: ```
158: 
159: *   **Explanation:** This function simply renders the main React component (`SinglePassApp`) responsible for the entire single-pass UI and logic, passing along the user's prompt and configuration. It uses a Promise to signal when the process is complete.
160: 
161: ### The Main UI and Logic (`singlepass-cli-app.tsx`)
162: 
163: This component manages the state (loading, thinking, confirming, etc.) and orchestrates the single-pass flow.
164: 
165: ```typescript
166: // File: codex-cli/src/components/singlepass-cli-app.tsx (Simplified Snippets)
167: import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
168: import { Box, Text, useApp } from "ink";
169: import OpenAI from "openai";
170: import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
171: // --- Local Utils ---
172: import { getFileContents } from "../utils/singlepass/context_files";
173: import { renderTaskContext } from "../utils/singlepass/context";
174: import { EditedFilesSchema, FileOperation } from "../utils/singlepass/file_ops";
175: import { generateDiffSummary, generateEditSummary } from "../utils/singlepass/code_diff";
176: import * as fsPromises from "fs/promises";
177: // --- UI Components ---
178: import { InputPrompt, ConfirmationPrompt } from "./prompts"; // Conceptual grouping
179: 
180: export function SinglePassApp({ /* ...props: config, rootPath, onExit ... */ }): JSX.Element {
181:   const app = useApp();
182:   const [state, setState] = useState("init"); // 'init', 'prompt', 'thinking', 'confirm', 'applied', 'error'...
183:   const [files, setFiles] = useState([]); // Holds { path, content }
184:   const [diffInfo, setDiffInfo] = useState({ summary: "", diffs: "", ops: [] });
185: 
186:   // 1. Load file context on mount
187:   useEffect(() => {
188:     (async () => {
189:       const fileContents = await getFileContents(rootPath, /* ignorePatterns */);
190:       setFiles(fileContents);
191:       setState("prompt"); // Ready for user input
192:     })();
193:   }, [rootPath]);
194: 
195:   // 2. Function to run the AI task
196:   async function runSinglePassTask(userPrompt: string) {
197:     setState("thinking");
198:     try {
199:       // Format the context + prompt for the AI
200:       const taskContextStr = renderTaskContext({ prompt: userPrompt, files, /*...*/ });
201: 
202:       const openai = new OpenAI({ /* ... config ... */ });
203:       // Call OpenAI, specifying the expected structured response format
204:       const chatResp = await openai.beta.chat.completions.parse({
205:         model: config.model,
206:         messages: [{ role: "user", content: taskContextStr }],
207:         response_format: zodResponseFormat(EditedFilesSchema, "schema"), // Ask for this specific structure!
208:       });
209: 
210:       const edited = chatResp.choices[0]?.message?.parsed; // The parsed { ops: [...] } object
211: 
212:       if (!edited || !Array.isArray(edited.ops)) { /* Handle no ops */ }
213: 
214:       // Generate diffs from the AI's proposed operations
215:       const [combinedDiffs, opsToApply] = generateDiffSummary(edited, /* original files map */);
216:       if (!opsToApply.length) { /* Handle no actual changes */ }
217: 
218:       const summary = generateEditSummary(opsToApply, /* original files map */);
219:       setDiffInfo({ summary, diffs: combinedDiffs, ops: opsToApply });
220:       setState("confirm"); // Move to confirmation state
221: 
222:     } catch (err) { setState("error"); }
223:   }
224: 
225:   // 3. Function to apply the changes
226:   async function applyFileOps(ops: Array<FileOperation>) {
227:     for (const op of ops) {
228:       if (op.delete) {
229:         await fsPromises.unlink(op.path).catch(() => {});
230:       } else { // Create or Update
231:         const newContent = op.updated_full_content || "";
232:         await fsPromises.mkdir(path.dirname(op.path), { recursive: true });
233:         await fsPromises.writeFile(op.path, newContent, "utf-8");
234:       }
235:       // Handle move_to separately if needed
236:     }
237:     setState("applied");
238:   }
239: 
240:   // --- Render logic based on `state` ---
241:   if (state === "prompt") {
242:     return <InputPrompt onSubmit={runSinglePassTask} /* ... */ />;
243:   }
244:   if (state === "thinking") { /* Show Spinner */ }
245:   if (state === "confirm") {
246:     return (
247:       <Box flexDirection="column">
248:         {/* Display diffInfo.summary and diffInfo.diffs */}
249:         <ConfirmationPrompt
250:           message="Apply these changes?"
251:           onResult={(accept) => {
252:             if (accept) applyFileOps(diffInfo.ops);
253:             else setState("skipped");
254:           }}
255:         />
256:       </Box>
257:     );
258:   }
259:   if (state === "applied") { /* Show success, maybe offer another prompt */ }
260:   // ... other states: init, error, skipped ...
261: 
262:   return <Text>...</Text>; // Fallback
263: }
264: ```
265: 
266: *   **Explanation:** This component uses `useEffect` to load files initially. The `runSinglePassTask` function orchestrates calling the AI (using `zodResponseFormat` to enforce the `EditedFilesSchema`) and generating diffs. `applyFileOps` performs the actual file system changes if the user confirms via the `ConfirmationPrompt`. The UI rendered depends heavily on the current `state`.
267: 
268: ### Defining the AI's Output: `file_ops.ts`
269: 
270: This file defines the exact structure Codex expects the AI to return in single-pass mode.
271: 
272: ```typescript
273: // File: codex-cli/src/utils/singlepass/file_ops.ts (Simplified)
274: import { z } from "zod"; // Zod is a schema validation library
275: 
276: // Schema for a single file operation
277: export const FileOperationSchema = z.object({
278:   path: z.string().describe("Absolute path to the file."),
279:   updated_full_content: z.string().optional().describe(
280:     "FULL CONTENT of the file after modification. MUST provide COMPLETE content."
281:   ),
282:   delete: z.boolean().optional().describe("Set true to delete the file."),
283:   move_to: z.string().optional().describe("New absolute path if file is moved."),
284:   // Ensure only one action per operation (update, delete, or move)
285: }).refine(/* ... validation logic ... */);
286: 
287: // Schema for the overall response containing a list of operations
288: export const EditedFilesSchema = z.object({
289:   ops: z.array(FileOperationSchema).describe("List of file operations."),
290: });
291: 
292: export type FileOperation = z.infer<typeof FileOperationSchema>;
293: export type EditedFiles = z.infer<typeof EditedFilesSchema>;
294: ```
295: 
296: *   **Explanation:** This uses the Zod library to define a strict schema. `FileOperationSchema` describes a single change (update, delete, or move), emphasizing that `updated_full_content` must be the *entire* file content. `EditedFilesSchema` wraps this in a list called `ops`. This schema is given to the OpenAI API (via `zodResponseFormat`) to ensure the AI's response is structured correctly.
297: 
298: ### Generating Context and Diffs
299: 
300: *   **`context.ts` (`renderTaskContext`):** Takes the user prompt and file contents and formats them into the large string sent to the AI, including instructions and often wrapping file content in XML-like tags (`<file><path>...</path><content>...</content></file>`).
301: *   **`code_diff.ts` (`generateDiffSummary`, `generateEditSummary`):** Takes the `ops` returned by the AI and compares the `updated_full_content` with the original content read from disk. It uses a library (like `diff`) to generate standard diff text and then formats it (often with colors) and creates a short summary list for display.

303: ## Conclusion
304: 
305: Single-Pass Mode offers a different, potentially faster way to use Codex for well-defined tasks. By providing extensive context upfront and asking the AI for a complete set of structured file operations in one response, it minimizes back-and-forth. You gather context, send one big request, review the complete proposed solution, and either accept or reject it entirely. While still experimental, it's a powerful approach for streamlining larger refactoring or generation tasks where the requirements are clear.
306: 
307: This concludes our tour through the core concepts of Codex! We've journeyed from the [Terminal UI](01_terminal_ui__ink_components_.md) and [Input Handling](02_input_handling__textbuffer_editor_.md), through the central [Agent Loop](03_agent_loop.md), into the crucial aspects of [Approval Policy & Security](04_approval_policy___security.md), [Response & Tool Call Handling](05_response___tool_call_handling.md), and safe [Command Execution & Sandboxing](06_command_execution___sandboxing.md), learned about [Configuration Management](07_configuration_management.md), and finally explored the alternative [Single-Pass Mode](08_single_pass_mode.md).
308: 
309: We hope this gives you a solid understanding of how Codex works under the hood. Feel free to dive deeper into the codebase, experiment, and perhaps even contribute!

  8: # Chapter 1: How We Fetch Webpages - AsyncCrawlerStrategy
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the Crawl4AI tutorial series! Our goal is to build intelligent agents that can understand and extract information from the web. The very first step in this process is actually *getting* the content from a webpage. This chapter explains how Crawl4AI handles that fundamental task.
 11: 
 12: Imagine you need to pick up a package from a specific address. How do you get there and retrieve it?
 13: *   You could send a **simple, fast drone** that just grabs the package off the porch (if it's easily accessible). This is quick but might fail if the package is inside or requires a signature.
 14: *   Or, you could send a **full delivery truck with a driver**. The driver can ring the bell, wait, sign for the package, and even handle complex instructions. This is more versatile but takes more time and resources.
 15: 
 16: In Crawl4AI, the `AsyncCrawlerStrategy` is like choosing your delivery vehicle. It defines *how* the crawler fetches the raw content (like the HTML, CSS, and maybe JavaScript results) of a webpage.
 17: 
 18: ## What Exactly is AsyncCrawlerStrategy?
 19: 
 20: `AsyncCrawlerStrategy` is a core concept in Crawl4AI that represents the **method** or **technique** used to download the content of a given URL. Think of it as a blueprint: it specifies *that* we need a way to fetch content, but the specific *details* of how it's done can vary.
 21: 
 22: This "blueprint" approach is powerful because it allows us to swap out the fetching mechanism depending on our needs, without changing the rest of our crawling logic.
 23: 
 24: ## The Default: AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy (The Delivery Truck)
 25: 
 26: By default, Crawl4AI uses `AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy`. This strategy uses a real, automated web browser engine (like Chrome, Firefox, or WebKit) behind the scenes.
 27: 
 28: **Why use a full browser?**
 29: 
 30: *   **Handles JavaScript:** Modern websites rely heavily on JavaScript to load content, change the layout, or fetch data after the initial page load. `AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy` runs this JavaScript, just like your normal browser does.
 31: *   **Simulates User Interaction:** It can wait for elements to appear, handle dynamic content, and see the page *after* scripts have run.
 32: *   **Gets the "Final" View:** It fetches the content as a user would see it in their browser.
 33: 
 34: This is our "delivery truck" – powerful and capable of handling complex websites. However, like a real truck, it's slower and uses more memory and CPU compared to simpler methods.
 35: 
 36: You generally don't need to *do* anything to use it, as it's the default! When you start Crawl4AI, it picks this strategy automatically.
 37: 
 38: ## Another Option: AsyncHTTPCrawlerStrategy (The Delivery Drone)
 39: 
 40: Crawl4AI also offers `AsyncHTTPCrawlerStrategy`. This strategy is much simpler. It directly requests the URL and downloads the *initial* HTML source code that the web server sends back.
 41: 
 42: **Why use this simpler strategy?**
 43: 
 44: *   **Speed:** It's significantly faster because it doesn't need to start a browser, render the page, or execute JavaScript.
 45: *   **Efficiency:** It uses much less memory and CPU.
 46: 
 47: This is our "delivery drone" – super fast and efficient for simple tasks.
 48: 
 49: **What's the catch?**
 50: 
 51: *   **No JavaScript:** It won't run any JavaScript on the page. If content is loaded dynamically by scripts, this strategy will likely miss it.
 52: *   **Basic HTML Only:** You get the raw HTML source, not necessarily what a user *sees* after the browser processes everything.
 53: 
 54: This strategy is great for websites with simple, static HTML content or when you only need the basic structure and metadata very quickly.
 55: 
 56: ## Why Have Different Strategies? (The Power of Abstraction)
 57: 
 58: Having `AsyncCrawlerStrategy` as a distinct concept offers several advantages:
 59: 
 60: 1.  **Flexibility:** You can choose the best tool for the job. Need to crawl complex, dynamic sites? Use the default `AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy`. Need to quickly fetch basic HTML from thousands of simple pages? Switch to `AsyncHTTPCrawlerStrategy`.
 61: 2.  **Maintainability:** The logic for *fetching* content is kept separate from the logic for *processing* it.
 62: 3.  **Extensibility:** Advanced users could even create their *own* custom strategies for specialized fetching needs (though that's beyond this beginner tutorial).
 63: 
 64: ## How It Works Conceptually
 65: 
 66: When you ask Crawl4AI to crawl a URL, the main `AsyncWebCrawler` doesn't fetch the content itself. Instead, it delegates the task to the currently selected `AsyncCrawlerStrategy`.
 67: 
 68: Here's a simplified flow:
 69: 
 70: ```mermaid
 71: sequenceDiagram
 72:     participant C as AsyncWebCrawler
 73:     participant S as AsyncCrawlerStrategy
 74:     participant W as Website
 75: 
 76:     C->>S: Please crawl("https://example.com")
 77:     Note over S: I'm using my method (e.g., Browser or HTTP)
 78:     S->>W: Request Page Content
 79:     W-->>S: Return Raw Content (HTML, etc.)
 80:     S-->>C: Here's the result (AsyncCrawlResponse)
 81: ```
 82: 
 83: The `AsyncWebCrawler` only needs to know how to talk to *any* strategy through a common interface (the `crawl` method). The strategy handles the specific details of the fetching process.
 84: 
 85: ## Using the Default Strategy (You're Already Doing It!)
 86: 
 87: Let's see how you use the default `AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy` without even needing to specify it.
 88: 
 89: ```python
 90: # main_example.py
 91: import asyncio
 92: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
 93: 
 94: async def main():
 95:     # When you create AsyncWebCrawler without specifying a strategy,
 96:     # it automatically uses AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy!
 97:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
 98:         print("Crawler is ready using the default strategy (Playwright).")
 99: 
100:         # Let's crawl a simple page that just returns HTML
101:         # We use CacheMode.BYPASS to ensure we fetch it fresh each time for this demo.
102:         config = CrawlerRunConfig(cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS)
103:         result = await crawler.arun(
104:             url="https://httpbin.org/html",
105:             config=config
106:         )
107: 
108:         if result.success:
109:             print("\nSuccessfully fetched content!")
110:             # The strategy fetched the raw HTML.
111:             # AsyncWebCrawler then processes it (more on that later).
112:             print(f"First 100 chars of fetched HTML: {result.html[:100]}...")
113:         else:
114:             print(f"\nFailed to fetch content: {result.error_message}")
115: 
116: if __name__ == "__main__":
117:     asyncio.run(main())
118: ```
119: 
120: **Explanation:**
121: 
122: 1.  We import `AsyncWebCrawler` and supporting classes.
123: 2.  We create an instance of `AsyncWebCrawler()` inside an `async with` block (this handles setup and cleanup). Since we didn't tell it *which* strategy to use, it defaults to `AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy`.
124: 3.  We call `crawler.arun()` to crawl the URL. Under the hood, the `AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy` starts a browser, navigates to the page, gets the content, and returns it.
125: 4.  We print the first part of the fetched HTML from the `result`.
126: 
127: ## Explicitly Choosing the HTTP Strategy
128: 
129: What if you know the page is simple and want the speed of the "delivery drone"? You can explicitly tell `AsyncWebCrawler` to use `AsyncHTTPCrawlerStrategy`.
130: 
131: ```python
132: # http_strategy_example.py
133: import asyncio
134: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
135: # Import the specific strategies we want to use
136: from crawl4ai.async_crawler_strategy import AsyncHTTPCrawlerStrategy
137: 
138: async def main():
139:     # 1. Create an instance of the strategy you want
140:     http_strategy = AsyncHTTPCrawlerStrategy()
141: 
142:     # 2. Pass the strategy instance when creating the AsyncWebCrawler
143:     async with AsyncWebCrawler(crawler_strategy=http_strategy) as crawler:
144:         print("Crawler is ready using the explicit HTTP strategy.")
145: 
146:         # Crawl the same simple page
147:         config = CrawlerRunConfig(cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS)
148:         result = await crawler.arun(
149:             url="https://httpbin.org/html",
150:             config=config
151:         )
152: 
153:         if result.success:
154:             print("\nSuccessfully fetched content using HTTP strategy!")
155:             print(f"First 100 chars of fetched HTML: {result.html[:100]}...")
156:         else:
157:             print(f"\nFailed to fetch content: {result.error_message}")
158: 
159: if __name__ == "__main__":
160:     asyncio.run(main())
161: ```
162: 
163: **Explanation:**
164: 
165: 1.  We now also import `AsyncHTTPCrawlerStrategy`.
166: 2.  We create an instance: `http_strategy = AsyncHTTPCrawlerStrategy()`.
167: 3.  We pass this instance to the `AsyncWebCrawler` constructor: `AsyncWebCrawler(crawler_strategy=http_strategy)`.
168: 4.  The rest of the code is the same, but now `crawler.arun()` will use the faster, simpler HTTP GET request method defined by `AsyncHTTPCrawlerStrategy`.
169: 
170: For a simple page like `httpbin.org/html`, both strategies will likely return the same HTML content, but the HTTP strategy would generally be faster and use fewer resources. On a complex JavaScript-heavy site, the HTTP strategy might fail to get the full content, while the Playwright strategy would handle it correctly.
171: 
172: ## A Glimpse Under the Hood
173: 
174: You don't *need* to know the deep internals to use the strategies, but it helps to understand the structure. Inside the `crawl4ai` library, you'd find a file like `async_crawler_strategy.py`.
175: 
176: It defines the "blueprint" (an Abstract Base Class):
177: 
178: ```python
179: # Simplified from async_crawler_strategy.py
180: from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
181: from .models import AsyncCrawlResponse # Defines the structure of the result
182: 
183: class AsyncCrawlerStrategy(ABC):
184:     """
185:     Abstract base class for crawler strategies.
186:     """
187:     @abstractmethod
188:     async def crawl(self, url: str, **kwargs) -> AsyncCrawlResponse:
189:         """Fetch content from the URL."""
190:         pass # Each specific strategy must implement this
191: ```
192: 
193: And then the specific implementations:
194: 
195: ```python
196: # Simplified from async_crawler_strategy.py
197: from playwright.async_api import Page # Playwright library for browser automation
198: # ... other imports
199: 
200: class AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy(AsyncCrawlerStrategy):
201:     # ... (Initialization code to manage browsers)
202: 
203:     async def crawl(self, url: str, config: CrawlerRunConfig, **kwargs) -> AsyncCrawlResponse:
204:         # Uses Playwright to:
205:         # 1. Get a browser page
206:         # 2. Navigate to the url (page.goto(url))
207:         # 3. Wait for content, run JS, etc.
208:         # 4. Get the final HTML (page.content())
209:         # 5. Optionally take screenshots, etc.
210:         # 6. Return an AsyncCrawlResponse
211:         # ... implementation details ...
212:         pass
213: ```
214: 
215: ```python
216: # Simplified from async_crawler_strategy.py
217: import aiohttp # Library for making HTTP requests asynchronously
218: # ... other imports
219: 
220: class AsyncHTTPCrawlerStrategy(AsyncCrawlerStrategy):
221:     # ... (Initialization code to manage HTTP sessions)
222: 
223:     async def crawl(self, url: str, config: CrawlerRunConfig, **kwargs) -> AsyncCrawlResponse:
224:         # Uses aiohttp to:
225:         # 1. Make an HTTP GET (or other method) request to the url
226:         # 2. Read the response body (HTML)
227:         # 3. Get response headers and status code
228:         # 4. Return an AsyncCrawlResponse
229:         # ... implementation details ...
230:         pass
231: ```
232: 
233: The key takeaway is that both strategies implement the same `crawl` method, allowing `AsyncWebCrawler` to use them interchangeably.
234: 
235: ## Conclusion
236: 
237: You've learned about `AsyncCrawlerStrategy`, the core concept defining *how* Crawl4AI fetches webpage content.
238: 
239: *   It's like choosing a vehicle: a powerful browser (`AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy`, the default) or a fast, simple HTTP request (`AsyncHTTPCrawlerStrategy`).
240: *   This abstraction gives you flexibility to choose the right fetching method for your task.
241: *   You usually don't need to worry about it, as the default handles most modern websites well.
242: 
243: Now that we understand how the raw content is fetched, the next step is to look at the main class that orchestrates the entire crawling process.
244: 
245: **Next:** Let's dive into the [AsyncWebCrawler](02_asyncwebcrawler.md) itself!

  8: # Chapter 2: Meet the General Manager - AsyncWebCrawler
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: How We Fetch Webpages - AsyncCrawlerStrategy](01_asynccrawlerstrategy.md), we learned about the different ways Crawl4AI can fetch the raw content of a webpage, like choosing between a fast drone (`AsyncHTTPCrawlerStrategy`) or a versatile delivery truck (`AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy`).
 11: 
 12: But who decides *which* delivery vehicle to use? Who tells it *which* address (URL) to go to? And who takes the delivered package (the raw HTML) and turns it into something useful?
 13: 
 14: That's where the `AsyncWebCrawler` comes in. Think of it as the **General Manager** of the entire crawling operation.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Does `AsyncWebCrawler` Solve?
 17: 
 18: Imagine you want to get information from a website. You need to:
 19: 
 20: 1.  Decide *how* to fetch the page (like choosing the drone or truck from Chapter 1).
 21: 2.  Actually *fetch* the page content.
 22: 3.  Maybe *clean up* the messy HTML.
 23: 4.  Perhaps *extract* specific pieces of information (like product prices or article titles).
 24: 5.  Maybe *save* the results so you don't have to fetch them again immediately (caching).
 25: 6.  Finally, give you the *final, processed result*.
 26: 
 27: Doing all these steps manually for every URL would be tedious and complex. `AsyncWebCrawler` acts as the central coordinator, managing all these steps for you. You just tell it what URL to crawl and maybe some preferences, and it handles the rest.
 28: 
 29: ## What is `AsyncWebCrawler`?
 30: 
 31: `AsyncWebCrawler` is the main class you'll interact with when using Crawl4AI. It's the primary entry point for starting any crawling task.
 32: 
 33: **Key Responsibilities:**
 34: 
 35: *   **Initialization:** Sets up the necessary components, like the browser (if needed).
 36: *   **Coordination:** Takes your request (a URL and configuration) and orchestrates the different parts:
 37:     *   Delegates fetching to an [AsyncCrawlerStrategy](01_asynccrawlerstrategy.md).
 38:     *   Manages caching using [CacheContext / CacheMode](09_cachecontext___cachemode.md).
 39:     *   Uses a [ContentScrapingStrategy](04_contentscrapingstrategy.md) to clean and parse HTML.
 40:     *   Applies a [RelevantContentFilter](05_relevantcontentfilter.md) if configured.
 41:     *   Uses an [ExtractionStrategy](06_extractionstrategy.md) to pull out specific data if needed.
 42: *   **Result Packaging:** Bundles everything up into a neat [CrawlResult](07_crawlresult.md) object.
 43: *   **Resource Management:** Handles starting and stopping resources (like browsers) cleanly.
 44: 
 45: It's the "conductor" making sure all the different instruments play together harmoniously.
 46: 
 47: ## Your First Crawl: Using `arun`
 48: 
 49: Let's see the `AsyncWebCrawler` in action. The most common way to use it is with an `async with` block, which automatically handles setup and cleanup. The main method to crawl a single URL is `arun`.
 50: 
 51: ```python
 52: # chapter2_example_1.py
 53: import asyncio
 54: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler # Import the General Manager
 55: 
 56: async def main():
 57:     # Create the General Manager instance using 'async with'
 58:     # This handles setup (like starting a browser if needed)
 59:     # and cleanup (closing the browser).
 60:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
 61:         print("Crawler is ready!")
 62: 
 63:         # Tell the manager to crawl a specific URL
 64:         url_to_crawl = "https://httpbin.org/html" # A simple example page
 65:         print(f"Asking the crawler to fetch: {url_to_crawl}")
 66: 
 67:         result = await crawler.arun(url=url_to_crawl)
 68: 
 69:         # Check if the crawl was successful
 70:         if result.success:
 71:             print("\nSuccess! Crawler got the content.")
 72:             # The result object contains the processed data
 73:             # We'll learn more about CrawlResult in Chapter 7
 74:             print(f"Page Title: {result.metadata.get('title', 'N/A')}")
 75:             print(f"First 100 chars of Markdown: {result.markdown.raw_markdown[:100]}...")
 76:         else:
 77:             print(f"\nFailed to crawl: {result.error_message}")
 78: 
 79: if __name__ == "__main__":
 80:     asyncio.run(main())
 81: ```
 82: 
 83: **Explanation:**
 84: 
 85: 1.  **`import AsyncWebCrawler`**: We import the main class.
 86: 2.  **`async def main():`**: Crawl4AI uses Python's `asyncio` for efficiency, so our code needs to be in an `async` function.
 87: 3.  **`async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:`**: This is the standard way to create and manage the crawler. The `async with` statement ensures that resources (like the underlying browser used by the default `AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy`) are properly started and stopped, even if errors occur.
 88: 4.  **`crawler.arun(url=url_to_crawl)`**: This is the core command. We tell our `crawler` instance (the General Manager) to run (`arun`) the crawling process for the specified `url`. `await` is used because fetching webpages takes time, and `asyncio` allows other tasks to run while waiting.
 89: 5.  **`result`**: The `arun` method returns a `CrawlResult` object. This object contains all the information gathered during the crawl (HTML, cleaned text, metadata, etc.). We'll explore this object in detail in [Chapter 7: Understanding the Results - CrawlResult](07_crawlresult.md).
 90: 6.  **`result.success`**: We check this boolean flag to see if the crawl completed without critical errors.
 91: 7.  **Accessing Data:** If successful, we can access processed information like the page title (`result.metadata['title']`) or the content formatted as Markdown (`result.markdown.raw_markdown`).
 92: 
 93: ## Configuring the Crawl
 94: 
 95: Sometimes, the default behavior isn't quite what you need. Maybe you want to use the faster "drone" strategy from Chapter 1, or perhaps you want to ensure you *always* fetch a fresh copy of the page, ignoring any saved cache.
 96: 
 97: You can customize the behavior of a specific `arun` call by passing a `CrawlerRunConfig` object. Think of this as giving specific instructions to the General Manager for *this particular job*.
 98: 
 99: ```python
100: # chapter2_example_2.py
101: import asyncio
102: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
103: from crawl4ai import CrawlerRunConfig # Import configuration class
104: from crawl4ai import CacheMode # Import cache options
105: 
106: async def main():
107:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
108:         print("Crawler is ready!")
109:         url_to_crawl = "https://httpbin.org/html"
110: 
111:         # Create a specific configuration for this run
112:         # Tell the crawler to BYPASS the cache (fetch fresh)
113:         run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
114:             cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
115:         )
116:         print("Configuration: Bypass cache for this run.")
117: 
118:         # Pass the config object to the arun method
119:         result = await crawler.arun(
120:             url=url_to_crawl,
121:             config=run_config # Pass the specific instructions
122:         )
123: 
124:         if result.success:
125:             print("\nSuccess! Crawler got fresh content (cache bypassed).")
126:             print(f"Page Title: {result.metadata.get('title', 'N/A')}")
127:         else:
128:             print(f"\nFailed to crawl: {result.error_message}")
129: 
130: if __name__ == "__main__":
131:     asyncio.run(main())
132: ```
133: 
134: **Explanation:**
135: 
136: 1.  **`from crawl4ai import CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode`**: We import the necessary classes for configuration.
137: 2.  **`run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(...)`**: We create an instance of `CrawlerRunConfig`. This object holds various settings for a specific crawl job.
138: 3.  **`cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS`**: We set the `cache_mode`. `CacheMode.BYPASS` tells the crawler to ignore any previously saved results for this URL and fetch it directly from the web server. We'll learn all about caching options in [Chapter 9: Smart Fetching with Caching - CacheContext / CacheMode](09_cachecontext___cachemode.md).
139: 4.  **`crawler.arun(..., config=run_config)`**: We pass our custom `run_config` object to the `arun` method using the `config` parameter.
140: 
141: The `CrawlerRunConfig` is very powerful and lets you control many aspects of the crawl, including which scraping or extraction methods to use. We'll dive deep into it in the next chapter: [Chapter 3: Giving Instructions - CrawlerRunConfig](03_crawlerrunconfig.md).
142: 
143: ## What Happens When You Call `arun`? (The Flow)
144: 
145: When you call `crawler.arun(url="...")`, the `AsyncWebCrawler` (our General Manager) springs into action and coordinates several steps behind the scenes:
146: 
147: ```mermaid
148: sequenceDiagram
149:     participant U as User
150:     participant AWC as AsyncWebCrawler (Manager)
151:     participant CC as Cache Check
152:     participant CS as AsyncCrawlerStrategy (Fetcher)

162:     else Cache Miss or Cache Mode prevents reading
163:         CC-->>AWC: No cached result / Cannot read cache.
164:         AWC->>CS: Please fetch "https://example.com" (using configured strategy)
165:         CS-->>AWC: Here's the raw response (HTML, etc.)

167:         SP-->>AWC: Here's the processed data (Markdown, Metadata, etc.)
168:         AWC->>CC: Cache this result? (Respect CacheMode in config)
169:         CC-->>AWC: OK, cached.
170:         AWC-->>CR: Package new result.
171:         AWC-->>U: Here is the CrawlResult
172:     end
173: 
174: ```
175: 
176: **Simplified Steps:**
177: 
178: 1.  **Receive Request:** The `AsyncWebCrawler` gets the URL and configuration from your `arun` call.
179: 2.  **Check Cache:** It checks if a valid result for this URL is already saved (cached) and if the `CacheMode` allows using it. (See [Chapter 9](09_cachecontext___cachemode.md)).
180: 3.  **Fetch (if needed):** If no valid cached result exists or caching is bypassed, it asks the configured [AsyncCrawlerStrategy](01_asynccrawlerstrategy.md) (e.g., Playwright or HTTP) to fetch the raw page content.
181: 4.  **Process Content:** It takes the raw HTML and passes it through various processing steps based on the configuration:
182:     *   **Scraping:** Cleaning up HTML, extracting basic structure using a [ContentScrapingStrategy](04_contentscrapingstrategy.md).
183:     *   **Filtering:** Optionally filtering content for relevance using a [RelevantContentFilter](05_relevantcontentfilter.md).
184:     *   **Extraction:** Optionally extracting specific structured data using an [ExtractionStrategy](06_extractionstrategy.md).
185: 5.  **Cache Result (if needed):** If caching is enabled for writing, it saves the final processed result.
186: 6.  **Return Result:** It bundles everything into a [CrawlResult](07_crawlresult.md) object and returns it to you.
187: 
188: ## Crawling Many Pages: `arun_many`
189: 
190: What if you have a whole list of URLs to crawl? Calling `arun` in a loop works, but it might not be the most efficient way. `AsyncWebCrawler` provides the `arun_many` method designed for this.
191: 
192: ```python
193: # chapter2_example_3.py
194: import asyncio
195: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
196: 
197: async def main():
198:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
199:         urls_to_crawl = [
200:             "https://httpbin.org/html",
201:             "https://httpbin.org/links/10/0",
202:             "https://httpbin.org/robots.txt"
203:         ]
204:         print(f"Asking crawler to fetch {len(urls_to_crawl)} URLs.")
205: 
206:         # Use arun_many for multiple URLs
207:         # We can still pass a config that applies to all URLs in the batch
208:         config = CrawlerRunConfig(cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS)
209:         results = await crawler.arun_many(urls=urls_to_crawl, config=config)
210: 
211:         print(f"\nFinished crawling! Got {len(results)} results.")
212:         for result in results:
213:             status = "Success" if result.success else "Failed"
214:             url_short = result.url.split('/')[-1] # Get last part of URL
215:             print(f"- URL: {url_short:<10} | Status: {status:<7} | Title: {result.metadata.get('title', 'N/A')}")
216: 
217: if __name__ == "__main__":
218:     asyncio.run(main())
219: ```
220: 
221: **Explanation:**
222: 
223: 1.  **`urls_to_crawl = [...]`**: We define a list of URLs.
224: 2.  **`await crawler.arun_many(urls=urls_to_crawl, config=config)`**: We call `arun_many`, passing the list of URLs. It handles crawling them concurrently (like dispatching multiple delivery trucks or drones efficiently).
225: 3.  **`results`**: `arun_many` returns a list where each item is a `CrawlResult` object corresponding to one of the input URLs.
226: 
227: `arun_many` is much more efficient for batch processing as it leverages `asyncio` to handle multiple fetches and processing tasks concurrently. It uses a [BaseDispatcher](10_basedispatcher.md) internally to manage this concurrency.
228: 
229: ## Under the Hood (A Peek at the Code)
230: 
231: You don't need to know the internal details to use `AsyncWebCrawler`, but seeing the structure can help. Inside the `crawl4ai` library, the file `async_webcrawler.py` defines this class.
232: 
233: ```python
234: # Simplified from async_webcrawler.py
235: 
236: # ... imports ...
237: from .async_crawler_strategy import AsyncCrawlerStrategy, AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy
238: from .async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig
239: from .models import CrawlResult
240: from .cache_context import CacheContext, CacheMode
241: # ... other strategy imports ...
242: 
243: class AsyncWebCrawler:
244:     def __init__(
245:         self,
246:         crawler_strategy: AsyncCrawlerStrategy = None, # You can provide a strategy...
247:         config: BrowserConfig = None, # Configuration for the browser
248:         # ... other parameters like logger, base_directory ...
249:     ):
250:         # If no strategy is given, it defaults to Playwright (the 'truck')
251:         self.crawler_strategy = crawler_strategy or AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy(...)
252:         self.browser_config = config or BrowserConfig()
253:         # ... setup logger, directories, etc. ...
254:         self.ready = False # Flag to track if setup is complete
255: 
256:     async def __aenter__(self):
257:         # This is called when you use 'async with'. It starts the strategy.
258:         await self.crawler_strategy.__aenter__()
259:         await self.awarmup() # Perform internal setup
260:         self.ready = True
261:         return self
262: 
263:     async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
264:         # This is called when exiting 'async with'. It cleans up.
265:         await self.crawler_strategy.__aexit__(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)
266:         self.ready = False
267: 
268:     async def arun(self, url: str, config: CrawlerRunConfig = None) -> CrawlResult:
269:         # 1. Ensure config exists, set defaults (like CacheMode.ENABLED)
270:         crawler_config = config or CrawlerRunConfig()
271:         if crawler_config.cache_mode is None:
272:             crawler_config.cache_mode = CacheMode.ENABLED
273: 
274:         # 2. Create CacheContext to manage caching logic
275:         cache_context = CacheContext(url, crawler_config.cache_mode)
276: 
277:         # 3. Try reading from cache if allowed
278:         cached_result = None
279:         if cache_context.should_read():
280:             cached_result = await async_db_manager.aget_cached_url(url)
281: 
282:         # 4. If cache hit and valid, return cached result
283:         if cached_result and self._is_cache_valid(cached_result, crawler_config):
284:              # ... log cache hit ...
285:              return cached_result
286: 
287:         # 5. If no cache hit or cache invalid/bypassed: Fetch fresh content
288:         #    Delegate to the configured AsyncCrawlerStrategy
289:         async_response = await self.crawler_strategy.crawl(url, config=crawler_config)
290: 
291:         # 6. Process the HTML (scrape, filter, extract)
292:         #    This involves calling other strategies based on config
293:         crawl_result = await self.aprocess_html(
294:             url=url,
295:             html=async_response.html,
296:             config=crawler_config,
297:             # ... other details from async_response ...
298:         )
299: 
300:         # 7. Write to cache if allowed
301:         if cache_context.should_write():
302:             await async_db_manager.acache_url(crawl_result)
303: 
304:         # 8. Return the final CrawlResult
305:         return crawl_result
306: 
307:     async def aprocess_html(self, url: str, html: str, config: CrawlerRunConfig, ...) -> CrawlResult:
308:         # This internal method handles:
309:         # - Getting the configured ContentScrapingStrategy
310:         # - Calling its 'scrap' method
311:         # - Getting the configured MarkdownGenerationStrategy
312:         # - Calling its 'generate_markdown' method
313:         # - Getting the configured ExtractionStrategy (if any)
314:         # - Calling its 'run' method
315:         # - Packaging everything into a CrawlResult
316:         # ... implementation details ...
317:         pass # Simplified
318: 
319:     async def arun_many(self, urls: List[str], config: Optional[CrawlerRunConfig] = None, ...) -> List[CrawlResult]:
320:         # Uses a Dispatcher (like MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher)
321:         # to run self.arun for each URL concurrently.
322:         # ... implementation details using a dispatcher ...
323:         pass # Simplified
324: 
325:     # ... other methods like awarmup, close, caching helpers ...
326: ```
327: 
328: The key takeaway is that `AsyncWebCrawler` doesn't do the fetching or detailed processing *itself*. It acts as the central hub, coordinating calls to the various specialized `Strategy` classes based on the provided configuration.
329: 
330: ## Conclusion
331: 
332: You've met the General Manager: `AsyncWebCrawler`!
333: 
334: *   It's the **main entry point** for using Crawl4AI.
335: *   It **coordinates** all the steps: fetching, caching, scraping, extracting.
336: *   You primarily interact with it using `async with` and the `arun()` (single URL) or `arun_many()` (multiple URLs) methods.
337: *   It takes a URL and an optional `CrawlerRunConfig` object to customize the crawl.
338: *   It returns a comprehensive `CrawlResult` object.
339: 
340: Now that you understand the central role of `AsyncWebCrawler`, let's explore how to give it detailed instructions for each crawling job.
341: 
342: **Next:** Let's dive into the specifics of configuration with [Chapter 3: Giving Instructions - CrawlerRunConfig](03_crawlerrunconfig.md).

  8: # Chapter 3: Giving Instructions - CrawlerRunConfig
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 2: Meet the General Manager - AsyncWebCrawler](02_asyncwebcrawler.md), we met the `AsyncWebCrawler`, the central coordinator for our web crawling tasks. We saw how to tell it *what* URL to crawl using the `arun` method.
 11: 
 12: But what if we want to tell the crawler *how* to crawl that URL? Maybe we want it to take a picture (screenshot) of the page? Or perhaps we only care about a specific section of the page? Or maybe we want to ignore the cache and get the very latest version?
 13: 
 14: Passing all these different instructions individually every time we call `arun` could get complicated and messy.
 15: 
 16: ```python
 17: # Imagine doing this every time - it gets long!
 18: # result = await crawler.arun(
 19: #     url="https://example.com",
 20: #     take_screenshot=True,
 21: #     ignore_cache=True,
 22: #     only_look_at_this_part="#main-content",
 23: #     wait_for_this_element="#data-table",
 24: #     # ... maybe many more settings ...
 25: # )
 26: ```
 27: 
 28: That's where `CrawlerRunConfig` comes in!
 29: 
 30: ## What Problem Does `CrawlerRunConfig` Solve?
 31: 
 32: Think of `CrawlerRunConfig` as the **Instruction Manual** for a *specific* crawl job. Instead of giving the `AsyncWebCrawler` manager lots of separate instructions each time, you bundle them all neatly into a single `CrawlerRunConfig` object.
 33: 
 34: This object tells the `AsyncWebCrawler` exactly *how* to handle a particular URL or set of URLs for that specific run. It makes your code cleaner and easier to manage.
 35: 
 36: ## What is `CrawlerRunConfig`?
 37: 
 38: `CrawlerRunConfig` is a configuration class that holds all the settings for a single crawl operation initiated by `AsyncWebCrawler.arun()` or `arun_many()`.
 39: 
 40: It allows you to customize various aspects of the crawl, such as:
 41: 
 42: *   **Taking Screenshots:** Should the crawler capture an image of the page? (`screenshot`)
 43: *   **Waiting:** How long should the crawler wait for the page or specific elements to load? (`page_timeout`, `wait_for`)
 44: *   **Focusing Content:** Should the crawler only process a specific part of the page? (`css_selector`)
 45: *   **Extracting Data:** Should the crawler use a specific method to pull out structured data? ([ExtractionStrategy](06_extractionstrategy.md))
 46: *   **Caching:** How should the crawler interact with previously saved results? ([CacheMode](09_cachecontext___cachemode.md))
 47: *   **And much more!** (like handling JavaScript, filtering links, etc.)
 48: 
 49: ## Using `CrawlerRunConfig`
 50: 
 51: Let's see how to use it. Remember our basic crawl from Chapter 2?
 52: 
 53: ```python
 54: # chapter3_example_1.py
 55: import asyncio
 56: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
 57: 
 58: async def main():
 59:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
 60:         url_to_crawl = "https://httpbin.org/html"
 61:         print(f"Crawling {url_to_crawl} with default settings...")
 62: 
 63:         # This uses the default behavior (no specific config)
 64:         result = await crawler.arun(url=url_to_crawl)
 65: 
 66:         if result.success:
 67:             print("Success! Got the content.")
 68:             print(f"Screenshot taken? {'Yes' if result.screenshot else 'No'}") # Likely No
 69:             # We'll learn about CacheMode later, but it defaults to using the cache
 70:         else:
 71:             print(f"Failed: {result.error_message}")
 72: 
 73: if __name__ == "__main__":
 74:     asyncio.run(main())
 75: ```
 76: 
 77: Now, let's say for this *specific* crawl, we want to bypass the cache (fetch fresh) and also take a screenshot.
 78: 
 79: We create a `CrawlerRunConfig` instance and pass it to `arun`:
 80: 
 81: ```python
 82: # chapter3_example_2.py
 83: import asyncio
 84: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
 85: from crawl4ai import CrawlerRunConfig # 1. Import the config class
 86: from crawl4ai import CacheMode        # Import cache options
 87: 
 88: async def main():
 89:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
 90:         url_to_crawl = "https://httpbin.org/html"
 91:         print(f"Crawling {url_to_crawl} with custom settings...")
 92: 
 93:         # 2. Create an instance of CrawlerRunConfig with our desired settings
 94:         my_instructions = CrawlerRunConfig(
 95:             cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS, # Don't use the cache, fetch fresh
 96:             screenshot=True              # Take a screenshot
 97:         )
 98:         print("Instructions: Bypass cache, take screenshot.")
 99: 
100:         # 3. Pass the config object to arun()
101:         result = await crawler.arun(
102:             url=url_to_crawl,
103:             config=my_instructions # Pass our instruction manual
104:         )
105: 
106:         if result.success:
107:             print("\nSuccess! Got the content with custom config.")
108:             print(f"Screenshot taken? {'Yes' if result.screenshot else 'No'}") # Should be Yes
109:             # Check if the screenshot file path exists in result.screenshot
110:             if result.screenshot:
111:                 print(f"Screenshot saved to: {result.screenshot}")
112:         else:
113:             print(f"\nFailed: {result.error_message}")
114: 
115: if __name__ == "__main__":
116:     asyncio.run(main())
117: ```
118: 
119: **Explanation:**
120: 
121: 1.  **Import:** We import `CrawlerRunConfig` and `CacheMode`.
122: 2.  **Create Config:** We create an instance: `my_instructions = CrawlerRunConfig(...)`. We set `cache_mode` to `CacheMode.BYPASS` and `screenshot` to `True`. All other settings remain at their defaults.
123: 3.  **Pass Config:** We pass this `my_instructions` object to `crawler.arun` using the `config=` parameter.
124: 
125: Now, when `AsyncWebCrawler` runs this job, it will look inside `my_instructions` and follow those specific settings for *this run only*.
126: 
127: ## Some Common `CrawlerRunConfig` Parameters
128: 
129: `CrawlerRunConfig` has many options, but here are a few common ones you might use:
130: 
131: *   **`cache_mode`**: Controls caching behavior.
132:     *   `CacheMode.ENABLED` (Default): Use the cache if available, otherwise fetch and save.
133:     *   `CacheMode.BYPASS`: Always fetch fresh, ignoring any cached version (but still save the new result).
134:     *   `CacheMode.DISABLED`: Never read from or write to the cache.
135:     *   *(More details in [Chapter 9: Smart Fetching with Caching - CacheContext / CacheMode](09_cachecontext___cachemode.md))*
136: *   **`screenshot` (bool)**: If `True`, takes a screenshot of the fully rendered page. The path to the screenshot file will be in `CrawlResult.screenshot`. Default: `False`.
137: *   **`pdf` (bool)**: If `True`, generates a PDF of the page. The path to the PDF file will be in `CrawlResult.pdf`. Default: `False`.
138: *   **`css_selector` (str)**: If provided (e.g., `"#main-content"` or `.article-body`), the crawler will try to extract *only* the HTML content within the element(s) matching this CSS selector. This is great for focusing on the important part of a page. Default: `None` (process the whole page).
139: *   **`wait_for` (str)**: A CSS selector (e.g., `"#data-loaded-indicator"`). The crawler will wait until an element matching this selector appears on the page before proceeding. Useful for pages that load content dynamically with JavaScript. Default: `None`.
140: *   **`page_timeout` (int)**: Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for page navigation or certain operations. Default: `60000` (60 seconds).
141: *   **`extraction_strategy`**: An object that defines how to extract specific, structured data (like product names and prices) from the page. Default: `None`. *(See [Chapter 6: Getting Specific Data - ExtractionStrategy](06_extractionstrategy.md))*
142: *   **`scraping_strategy`**: An object defining how the raw HTML is cleaned and basic content (like text and links) is extracted. Default: `WebScrapingStrategy()`. *(See [Chapter 4: Cleaning Up the Mess - ContentScrapingStrategy](04_contentscrapingstrategy.md))*
143: 
144: Let's try combining a few: focus on a specific part of the page and wait for something to appear.
145: 
146: ```python
147: # chapter3_example_3.py
148: import asyncio
149: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
150: 
151: async def main():
152:     # This example site has a heading 'H1' inside a 'body' tag.
153:     url_to_crawl = "https://httpbin.org/html"
154:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
155:         print(f"Crawling {url_to_crawl}, focusing on the H1 tag...")
156: 
157:         # Instructions: Only get the H1 tag, wait max 10s for it
158:         specific_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
159:             css_selector="h1", # Only grab content inside <h1> tags
160:             page_timeout=10000 # Set page timeout to 10 seconds
161:             # We could also add wait_for="h1" if needed for dynamic loading
162:         )
163: 
164:         result = await crawler.arun(url=url_to_crawl, config=specific_config)
165: 
166:         if result.success:
167:             print("\nSuccess! Focused crawl completed.")
168:             # The markdown should now ONLY contain the H1 content
169:             print(f"Markdown content:\n---\n{result.markdown.raw_markdown.strip()}\n---")
170:         else:
171:             print(f"\nFailed: {result.error_message}")
172: 
173: if __name__ == "__main__":
174:     asyncio.run(main())
175: ```
176: 
177: This time, the `result.markdown` should only contain the text from the `<h1>` tag on that page, because we used `css_selector="h1"` in our `CrawlerRunConfig`.
178: 
179: ## How `AsyncWebCrawler` Uses the Config (Under the Hood)
180: 
181: You don't need to know the exact internal code, but it helps to understand the flow. When you call `crawler.arun(url, config=my_config)`, the `AsyncWebCrawler` essentially does this:
182: 
183: 1.  Receives the `url` and the `my_config` object.
184: 2.  Before fetching, it checks `my_config.cache_mode` to see if it should look in the cache first.
185: 3.  If fetching is needed, it passes `my_config` to the underlying [AsyncCrawlerStrategy](01_asynccrawlerstrategy.md).
186: 4.  The strategy uses settings from `my_config` like `page_timeout`, `wait_for`, and whether to take a `screenshot`.
187: 5.  After getting the raw HTML, `AsyncWebCrawler` uses the `my_config.scraping_strategy` and `my_config.css_selector` to process the content.
188: 6.  If `my_config.extraction_strategy` is set, it uses that to extract structured data.
189: 7.  Finally, it bundles everything into a `CrawlResult` and returns it.
190: 
191: Here's a simplified view:
192:

211:     end
212:     AWC-->>User: Return CrawlResult
213: ```
214: 
215: The `CrawlerRunConfig` acts as a messenger carrying your specific instructions throughout the crawling process.
216: 
217: Inside the `crawl4ai` library, in the file `async_configs.py`, you'll find the definition of the `CrawlerRunConfig` class. It looks something like this (simplified):
218: 
219: ```python
220: # Simplified from crawl4ai/async_configs.py
221: 
222: from .cache_context import CacheMode
223: from .extraction_strategy import ExtractionStrategy
224: from .content_scraping_strategy import ContentScrapingStrategy, WebScrapingStrategy
225: # ... other imports ...
226: 
227: class CrawlerRunConfig():
228:     """
229:     Configuration class for controlling how the crawler runs each crawl operation.
230:     """
231:     def __init__(
232:         self,
233:         # Caching
234:         cache_mode: CacheMode = CacheMode.BYPASS, # Default behavior if not specified
235: 
236:         # Content Selection / Waiting
237:         css_selector: str = None,
238:         wait_for: str = None,
239:         page_timeout: int = 60000, # 60 seconds
240: 
241:         # Media
242:         screenshot: bool = False,
243:         pdf: bool = False,

246:         scraping_strategy: ContentScrapingStrategy = None, # Defaults internally if None
247:         extraction_strategy: ExtractionStrategy = None,
248: 
249:         # ... many other parameters omitted for clarity ...
250:         **kwargs # Allows for flexibility
251:     ):
252:         self.cache_mode = cache_mode
253:         self.css_selector = css_selector
254:         self.wait_for = wait_for
255:         self.page_timeout = page_timeout
256:         self.screenshot = screenshot
257:         self.pdf = pdf
258:         # Assign scraping strategy, ensuring a default if None is provided
259:         self.scraping_strategy = scraping_strategy or WebScrapingStrategy()
260:         self.extraction_strategy = extraction_strategy
261:         # ... initialize other attributes ...
262: 
263:     # Helper methods like 'clone', 'to_dict', 'from_kwargs' might exist too
264:     # ...
265: ```
266: 
267: The key idea is that it's a class designed to hold various settings together. When you create an instance `CrawlerRunConfig(...)`, you're essentially creating an object that stores your choices for these parameters.
268: 
269: ## Conclusion
270: 
271: You've learned about `CrawlerRunConfig`, the "Instruction Manual" for individual crawl jobs in Crawl4AI!
272: 
273: *   It solves the problem of passing many settings individually to `AsyncWebCrawler`.
274: *   You create an instance of `CrawlerRunConfig` and set the parameters you want to customize (like `cache_mode`, `screenshot`, `css_selector`, `wait_for`).
275: *   You pass this config object to `crawler.arun(url, config=your_config)`.
276: *   This makes your code cleaner and gives you fine-grained control over *how* each crawl is performed.
277: 
278: Now that we know how to fetch content ([AsyncCrawlerStrategy](01_asynccrawlerstrategy.md)), manage the overall process ([AsyncWebCrawler](02_asyncwebcrawler.md)), and give specific instructions ([CrawlerRunConfig](03_crawlerrunconfig.md)), let's look at how the raw, messy HTML fetched from the web is initially cleaned up and processed.
279: 
280: **Next:** Let's explore [Chapter 4: Cleaning Up the Mess - ContentScrapingStrategy](04_contentscrapingstrategy.md).

  8: # Chapter 4: Cleaning Up the Mess - ContentScrapingStrategy
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 3: Giving Instructions - CrawlerRunConfig](03_crawlerrunconfig.md), we learned how to give specific instructions to our `AsyncWebCrawler` using `CrawlerRunConfig`. This included telling it *how* to fetch the page and potentially take screenshots or PDFs.
 11: 
 12: Now, imagine the crawler has successfully fetched the raw HTML content of a webpage. What's next? Raw HTML is often messy! It contains not just the main article or product description you might care about, but also:
 13: 
 14: *   Navigation menus
 15: *   Advertisements
 16: *   Headers and footers
 17: *   Hidden code like JavaScript (`<script>`) and styling information (`<style>`)
 18: *   Comments left by developers
 19: 
 20: Before we can really understand the *meaning* of the page or extract specific important information, we need to clean up this mess and get a basic understanding of its structure.
 21: 
 22: ## What Problem Does `ContentScrapingStrategy` Solve?
 23: 
 24: Think of the raw HTML fetched by the crawler as a very rough first draft of a book manuscript. It has the core story, but it's full of editor's notes, coffee stains, layout instructions for the printer, and maybe even doodles in the margins.
 25: 
 26: Before the *main* editor (who focuses on plot and character) can work on it, someone needs to do an initial cleanup. This "First Pass Editor" would:
 27: 
 28: 1.  Remove the coffee stains and doodles (irrelevant stuff like ads, scripts, styles).
 29: 2.  Identify the basic structure: chapter headings (like the page title), paragraph text, image captions (image alt text), and maybe a list of illustrations (links).
 30: 3.  Produce a tidier version of the manuscript, ready for more detailed analysis.
 31: 
 32: In Crawl4AI, the `ContentScrapingStrategy` acts as this **First Pass Editor**. It takes the raw HTML and performs an initial cleanup and structure extraction. Its job is to transform the messy HTML into a more manageable format, identifying key elements like text content, links, images, and basic page metadata (like the title).
 33: 
 34: ## What is `ContentScrapingStrategy`?
 35: 
 36: `ContentScrapingStrategy` is an abstract concept (like a job description) in Crawl4AI that defines *how* the initial processing of raw HTML should happen. It specifies *that* we need a method to clean HTML and extract basic structure, but the specific tools and techniques used can vary.
 37: 
 38: This allows Crawl4AI to be flexible. Different strategies might use different underlying libraries or have different performance characteristics.
 39: 
 40: ## The Implementations: Meet the Editors
 41: 
 42: Crawl4AI provides concrete implementations (the actual editors doing the work) of this strategy:
 43: 
 44: 1.  **`WebScrapingStrategy` (The Default Editor):**
 45:     *   This is the strategy used by default if you don't specify otherwise.
 46:     *   It uses a popular Python library called `BeautifulSoup` behind the scenes to parse and manipulate the HTML.
 47:     *   It's generally robust and good at handling imperfect HTML.
 48:     *   Think of it as a reliable, experienced editor who does a thorough job.
 49: 
 50: 2.  **`LXMLWebScrapingStrategy` (The Speedy Editor):**
 51:     *   This strategy uses another powerful library called `lxml`.
 52:     *   `lxml` is often faster than `BeautifulSoup`, especially on large or complex pages.
 53:     *   Think of it as a very fast editor who might be slightly stricter about the manuscript's format but gets the job done quickly.
 54: 
 55: For most beginners, the default `WebScrapingStrategy` works perfectly fine! You usually don't need to worry about switching unless you encounter performance issues on very large-scale crawls (which is a more advanced topic).
 56: 
 57: ## How It Works Conceptually
 58: 
 59: Here's the flow:
 60: 
 61: 1.  The [AsyncWebCrawler](02_asyncwebcrawler.md) receives the raw HTML from the [AsyncCrawlerStrategy](01_asynccrawlerstrategy.md) (the fetcher).
 62: 2.  It looks at the [CrawlerRunConfig](03_crawlerrunconfig.md) to see which `ContentScrapingStrategy` to use (defaulting to `WebScrapingStrategy` if none is specified).
 63: 3.  It hands the raw HTML over to the chosen strategy's `scrap` method.
 64: 4.  The strategy parses the HTML, removes unwanted tags (like `<script>`, `<style>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, etc., based on its internal rules), extracts all links (`<a>` tags), images (`<img>` tags with their `alt` text), and metadata (like the `<title>` tag).
 65: 5.  It returns the results packaged in a `ScrapingResult` object, containing the cleaned HTML, lists of links and media items, and extracted metadata.
 66: 6.  The `AsyncWebCrawler` then takes this `ScrapingResult` and uses its contents (along with other info) to build the final [CrawlResult](07_crawlresult.md).
 67:

 82:     AWC->>CR: Combine ScrapingResult with other info
 83:     AWC-->>User: Return final CrawlResult
 84: ```
 85: 
 86: ## Using the Default Strategy (`WebScrapingStrategy`)
 87: 
 88: You're likely already using it without realizing it! When you run a basic crawl, `AsyncWebCrawler` automatically employs `WebScrapingStrategy`.
 89: 
 90: ```python
 91: # chapter4_example_1.py
 92: import asyncio
 93: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
 94: 
 95: async def main():
 96:     # Uses the default AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy (fetching)
 97:     # AND the default WebScrapingStrategy (scraping/cleaning)
 98:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
 99:         url_to_crawl = "https://httpbin.org/html" # A very simple HTML page
100: 
101:         # We don't specify a scraping_strategy in the config, so it uses the default
102:         config = CrawlerRunConfig(cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS) # Fetch fresh
103: 
104:         print(f"Crawling {url_to_crawl} using default scraping strategy...")
105:         result = await crawler.arun(url=url_to_crawl, config=config)
106: 
107:         if result.success:
108:             print("\nSuccess! Content fetched and scraped.")
109:             # The 'result' object now contains info processed by WebScrapingStrategy
110: 
111:             # 1. Metadata extracted (e.g., page title)
112:             print(f"Page Title: {result.metadata.get('title', 'N/A')}")
113: 
114:             # 2. Links extracted
115:             print(f"Found {len(result.links.internal)} internal links and {len(result.links.external)} external links.")
116:             # Example: print first external link if exists
117:             if result.links.external:
118:                 print(f"  Example external link: {result.links.external[0].href}")
119: 
120:             # 3. Media extracted (images, videos, etc.)
121:             print(f"Found {len(result.media.images)} images.")
122:              # Example: print first image alt text if exists
123:             if result.media.images:
124:                 print(f"  Example image alt text: '{result.media.images[0].alt}'")
125: 
126:             # 4. Cleaned HTML (scripts, styles etc. removed) - might still be complex
127:             # print(f"\nCleaned HTML snippet:\n---\n{result.cleaned_html[:200]}...\n---")
128: 
129:             # 5. Markdown representation (generated AFTER scraping)
130:             print(f"\nMarkdown snippet:\n---\n{result.markdown.raw_markdown[:200]}...\n---")
131: 
132:         else:
133:             print(f"\nFailed: {result.error_message}")
134: 
135: if __name__ == "__main__":
136:     asyncio.run(main())
137: ```
138: 
139: **Explanation:**
140: 
141: 1.  We create `AsyncWebCrawler` and `CrawlerRunConfig` as usual.
142: 2.  We **don't** set the `scraping_strategy` parameter in `CrawlerRunConfig`. Crawl4AI automatically picks `WebScrapingStrategy`.
143: 3.  When `crawler.arun` executes, after fetching the HTML, it internally calls `WebScrapingStrategy.scrap()`.
144: 4.  The `result` (a [CrawlResult](07_crawlresult.md) object) contains fields populated by the scraping strategy:
145:     *   `result.metadata`: Contains things like the page title found in `<title>` tags.
146:     *   `result.links`: Contains lists of internal and external links found (`<a>` tags).
147:     *   `result.media`: Contains lists of images (`<img>`), videos (`<video>`), etc.
148:     *   `result.cleaned_html`: The HTML after the strategy removed unwanted tags and attributes (this is then used to generate the Markdown).
149:     *   `result.markdown`: While not *directly* created by the scraping strategy, the cleaned HTML it produces is the input for generating the Markdown representation.
150: 
151: ## Explicitly Choosing a Strategy (e.g., `LXMLWebScrapingStrategy`)
152: 
153: What if you want to try the potentially faster `LXMLWebScrapingStrategy`? You can specify it in the `CrawlerRunConfig`.
154: 
155: ```python
156: # chapter4_example_2.py
157: import asyncio
158: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
159: # 1. Import the specific strategy you want to use
160: from crawl4ai import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy
161: 
162: async def main():
163:     # 2. Create an instance of the desired scraping strategy
164:     lxml_editor = LXMLWebScrapingStrategy()
165:     print(f"Using scraper: {lxml_editor.__class__.__name__}")
166: 
167:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
168:         url_to_crawl = "https://httpbin.org/html"
169: 
170:         # 3. Create a CrawlerRunConfig and pass the strategy instance
171:         config = CrawlerRunConfig(
172:             cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
173:             scraping_strategy=lxml_editor # Tell the config which strategy to use
174:         )
175: 
176:         print(f"Crawling {url_to_crawl} with explicit LXML scraping strategy...")
177:         result = await crawler.arun(url=url_to_crawl, config=config)
178: 
179:         if result.success:
180:             print("\nSuccess! Content fetched and scraped using LXML.")
181:             print(f"Page Title: {result.metadata.get('title', 'N/A')}")
182:             print(f"Found {len(result.links.external)} external links.")
183:             # Output should be largely the same as the default strategy for simple pages
184:         else:

189: ```
190: 
191: **Explanation:**
192: 
193: 1.  **Import:** We import `LXMLWebScrapingStrategy` alongside the other classes.
194: 2.  **Instantiate:** We create an instance: `lxml_editor = LXMLWebScrapingStrategy()`.
195: 3.  **Configure:** We create `CrawlerRunConfig` and pass our instance to the `scraping_strategy` parameter: `CrawlerRunConfig(..., scraping_strategy=lxml_editor)`.
196: 4.  **Run:** Now, when `crawler.arun` is called with this config, it will use `LXMLWebScrapingStrategy` instead of the default `WebScrapingStrategy` for the initial HTML processing step.
197: 
198: For simple pages, the results from both strategies will often be very similar. The choice typically comes down to performance considerations in more advanced scenarios.
199: 
200: ## A Glimpse Under the Hood
201: 
202: Inside the `crawl4ai` library, the file `content_scraping_strategy.py` defines the blueprint and the implementations.
203: 
204: **The Blueprint (Abstract Base Class):**
205: 
206: ```python
207: # Simplified from crawl4ai/content_scraping_strategy.py
208: from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
209: from .models import ScrapingResult # Defines the structure of the result
210: 
211: class ContentScrapingStrategy(ABC):
212:     """Abstract base class for content scraping strategies."""
213: 
214:     @abstractmethod
215:     def scrap(self, url: str, html: str, **kwargs) -> ScrapingResult:
216:         """
217:         Synchronous method to scrape content.
218:         Takes raw HTML, returns structured ScrapingResult.
219:         """
220:         pass
221: 
222:     @abstractmethod
223:     async def ascrap(self, url: str, html: str, **kwargs) -> ScrapingResult:
224:         """
225:         Asynchronous method to scrape content.
226:         Takes raw HTML, returns structured ScrapingResult.
227:         """
228:         pass
229: ```
230: 
231: **The Implementations:**
232: 
233: ```python
234: # Simplified from crawl4ai/content_scraping_strategy.py
235: from bs4 import BeautifulSoup # Library used by WebScrapingStrategy
236: # ... other imports like models ...
237: 
238: class WebScrapingStrategy(ContentScrapingStrategy):
239:     def __init__(self, logger=None):
240:         self.logger = logger
241:         # ... potentially other setup ...
242: 
243:     def scrap(self, url: str, html: str, **kwargs) -> ScrapingResult:
244:         # 1. Parse HTML using BeautifulSoup
245:         soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'lxml') # Or another parser
246: 
247:         # 2. Find the main content area (maybe using kwargs['css_selector'])
248:         # 3. Remove unwanted tags (scripts, styles, nav, footer, ads...)
249:         # 4. Extract metadata (title, description...)
250:         # 5. Extract all links (<a> tags)
251:         # 6. Extract all images (<img> tags) and other media
252:         # 7. Get the remaining cleaned HTML text content
253: 
254:         # ... complex cleaning and extraction logic using BeautifulSoup methods ...
255: 
256:         # 8. Package results into a ScrapingResult object
257:         cleaned_html_content = "<html><body>Cleaned content...</body></html>" # Placeholder
258:         links_data = Links(...)
259:         media_data = Media(...)
260:         metadata_dict = {"title": "Page Title"}
261: 
262:         return ScrapingResult(
263:             cleaned_html=cleaned_html_content,
264:             links=links_data,
265:             media=media_data,
266:             metadata=metadata_dict,
267:             success=True
268:         )
269: 
270:     async def ascrap(self, url: str, html: str, **kwargs) -> ScrapingResult:
271:         # Often delegates to the synchronous version for CPU-bound tasks
272:         return await asyncio.to_thread(self.scrap, url, html, **kwargs)
273: 
274: ```
275: 
276: ```python
277: # Simplified from crawl4ai/content_scraping_strategy.py
278: from lxml import html as lhtml # Library used by LXMLWebScrapingStrategy
279: # ... other imports like models ...
280: 
281: class LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(WebScrapingStrategy): # Often inherits for shared logic
282:     def __init__(self, logger=None):
283:         super().__init__(logger)
284:         # ... potentially LXML specific setup ...
285: 
286:     def scrap(self, url: str, html: str, **kwargs) -> ScrapingResult:
287:         # 1. Parse HTML using lxml
288:         doc = lhtml.document_fromstring(html)
289: 
290:         # 2. Find main content, remove unwanted tags, extract info
291:         # ... complex cleaning and extraction logic using lxml's XPath or CSS selectors ...
292: 
293:         # 3. Package results into a ScrapingResult object
294:         cleaned_html_content = "<html><body>Cleaned LXML content...</body></html>" # Placeholder
295:         links_data = Links(...)
296:         media_data = Media(...)
297:         metadata_dict = {"title": "Page Title LXML"}
298: 
299:         return ScrapingResult(
300:             cleaned_html=cleaned_html_content,
301:             links=links_data,
302:             media=media_data,
303:             metadata=metadata_dict,
304:             success=True
305:         )
306: 
307:     # ascrap might also delegate or have specific async optimizations
308: ```
309: 
310: The key takeaway is that both strategies implement the `scrap` (and `ascrap`) method, taking raw HTML and returning a structured `ScrapingResult`. The `AsyncWebCrawler` can use either one thanks to this common interface.
311: 
312: ## Conclusion
313: 
314: You've learned about `ContentScrapingStrategy`, Crawl4AI's "First Pass Editor" for raw HTML.
315: 
316: *   It tackles the problem of messy HTML by cleaning it and extracting basic structure.
317: *   It acts as a blueprint, with `WebScrapingStrategy` (default, using BeautifulSoup) and `LXMLWebScrapingStrategy` (using lxml) as concrete implementations.
318: *   It's used automatically by `AsyncWebCrawler` after fetching content.
319: *   You can specify which strategy to use via `CrawlerRunConfig`.
320: *   Its output (cleaned HTML, links, media, metadata) is packaged into a `ScrapingResult` and contributes significantly to the final `CrawlResult`.
321: 
322: Now that we have this initially cleaned and structured content, we might want to further filter it. What if we only care about the parts of the page that are *relevant* to a specific topic?
323: 
324: **Next:** Let's explore how to filter content for relevance with [Chapter 5: Focusing on What Matters - RelevantContentFilter](05_relevantcontentfilter.md).

  8: # Chapter 5: Focusing on What Matters - RelevantContentFilter
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 4: Cleaning Up the Mess - ContentScrapingStrategy](04_contentscrapingstrategy.md), we learned how Crawl4AI takes the raw, messy HTML from a webpage and cleans it up using a `ContentScrapingStrategy`. This gives us a tidier version of the HTML (`cleaned_html`) and extracts basic elements like links and images.
 11: 
 12: But even after this initial cleanup, the page might still contain a lot of "noise" relative to what we *actually* care about. Imagine a news article page: the `ContentScrapingStrategy` might remove scripts and styles, but it could still leave the main article text, plus related article links, user comments, sidebars with ads, and maybe a lengthy footer.
 13: 
 14: If our goal is just to get the main article content (e.g., to summarize it or feed it to an AI), all that extra stuff is just noise. How can we filter the cleaned content even further to keep only the truly relevant parts?
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Does `RelevantContentFilter` Solve?
 17: 
 18: Think of the `cleaned_html` from the previous step like flour that's been roughly sifted – the biggest lumps are gone, but there might still be smaller clumps or bran mixed in. If you want super fine flour for a delicate cake, you need a finer sieve.
 19: 
 20: `RelevantContentFilter` acts as this **finer sieve** or a **Relevance Sieve**. It's a strategy applied *after* the initial cleaning by `ContentScrapingStrategy` but *before* the final processing (like generating the final Markdown output or using an AI for extraction). Its job is to go through the cleaned content and decide which parts are truly relevant to our goal, removing the rest.
 21: 
 22: This helps us:
 23: 
 24: 1.  **Reduce Noise:** Eliminate irrelevant sections like comments, footers, navigation bars, or tangential "related content" blocks.
 25: 2.  **Focus AI:** If we're sending the content to a Large Language Model (LLM), feeding it only the most relevant parts saves processing time (and potentially money) and can lead to better results.
 26: 3.  **Improve Accuracy:** By removing distracting noise, subsequent steps like data extraction are less likely to grab the wrong information.
 27: 
 28: ## What is `RelevantContentFilter`?
 29: 
 30: `RelevantContentFilter` is an abstract concept (a blueprint) in Crawl4AI representing a **method for identifying and retaining only the relevant portions of cleaned HTML content**. It defines *that* we need a way to filter for relevance, but the specific technique used can vary.
 31: 
 32: This allows us to choose different filtering approaches depending on the task and the type of content.
 33: 
 34: ## The Different Filters: Tools for Sieving
 35: 
 36: Crawl4AI provides several concrete implementations (the actual sieves) of `RelevantContentFilter`:
 37: 
 38: 1.  **`BM25ContentFilter` (The Keyword Sieve):**
 39:     *   **Analogy:** Like a mini search engine operating *within* the webpage.
 40:     *   **How it Works:** You give it (or it figures out) some keywords related to what you're looking for (e.g., from a user query like "product specifications" or derived from the page title). It then uses a search algorithm called BM25 to score different chunks of the cleaned HTML based on how relevant they are to those keywords. Only the chunks scoring above a certain threshold are kept.
 41:     *   **Good For:** Finding specific sections about a known topic within a larger page (e.g., finding only the paragraphs discussing "climate change impact" on a long environmental report page).
 42: 
 43: 2.  **`PruningContentFilter` (The Structural Sieve):**
 44:     *   **Analogy:** Like a gardener pruning a bush, removing weak or unnecessary branches based on their structure.
 45:     *   **How it Works:** This filter doesn't care about keywords. Instead, it looks at the *structure* and *characteristics* of the HTML elements. It removes elements that often represent noise, such as those with very little text compared to the number of links (low text density), elements with common "noise" words in their CSS classes or IDs (like `sidebar`, `comments`, `footer`), or elements deemed structurally insignificant.
 46:     *   **Good For:** Removing common boilerplate sections (like headers, footers, simple sidebars, navigation) based purely on layout and density clues, even if you don't have a specific topic query.
 47: 
 48: 3.  **`LLMContentFilter` (The AI Sieve):**
 49:     *   **Analogy:** Asking a smart assistant to read the cleaned content and pick out only the parts relevant to your request.
 50:     *   **How it Works:** This filter sends the cleaned HTML (often broken into manageable chunks) to a Large Language Model (like GPT). You provide an instruction (e.g., "Extract only the main article content, removing all comments and related links" or "Keep only the sections discussing financial results"). The AI uses its understanding of language and context to identify and return only the relevant parts, often already formatted nicely (like in Markdown).
 51:     *   **Good For:** Handling complex relevance decisions that require understanding meaning and context, following nuanced natural language instructions. (Note: Requires configuring LLM access, like API keys, and can be slower and potentially costlier than other methods).
 52: 
 53: ## How `RelevantContentFilter` is Used (Via Markdown Generation)
 54: 
 55: In Crawl4AI, the `RelevantContentFilter` is typically integrated into the **Markdown generation** step. The standard markdown generator (`DefaultMarkdownGenerator`) can accept a `RelevantContentFilter` instance.
 56: 
 57: When configured this way:
 58: 
 59: 1.  The `AsyncWebCrawler` fetches the page and uses the `ContentScrapingStrategy` to get `cleaned_html`.
 60: 2.  It then calls the `DefaultMarkdownGenerator` to produce the Markdown output.
 61: 3.  The generator first creates the standard, "raw" Markdown from the *entire* `cleaned_html`.
 62: 4.  **If** a `RelevantContentFilter` was provided to the generator, it then uses this filter on the `cleaned_html` to select only the relevant HTML fragments.
 63: 5.  It converts *these filtered fragments* into Markdown. This becomes the `fit_markdown`.
 64: 
 65: So, the `CrawlResult` will contain *both*:
 66: *   `result.markdown.raw_markdown`: Markdown based on the full `cleaned_html`.
 67: *   `result.markdown.fit_markdown`: Markdown based *only* on the parts deemed relevant by the filter.
 68: 
 69: Let's see how to configure this.
 70: 
 71: ### Example 1: Using `BM25ContentFilter` to find specific content
 72: 
 73: Imagine we crawled a page about renewable energy, but we only want the parts specifically discussing **solar power**.
 74: 
 75: ```python
 76: # chapter5_example_1.py
 77: import asyncio
 78: from crawl4ai import (
 79:     AsyncWebCrawler,
 80:     CrawlerRunConfig,
 81:     DefaultMarkdownGenerator, # The standard markdown generator
 82:     BM25ContentFilter         # The keyword-based filter
 83: )
 84: 
 85: async def main():
 86:     # 1. Create the BM25 filter with our query
 87:     solar_filter = BM25ContentFilter(user_query="solar power technology")
 88:     print(f"Filter created for query: '{solar_filter.user_query}'")
 89: 
 90:     # 2. Create a Markdown generator that USES this filter
 91:     markdown_generator_with_filter = DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
 92:         content_filter=solar_filter
 93:     )
 94:     print("Markdown generator configured with BM25 filter.")
 95: 
 96:     # 3. Create CrawlerRunConfig using this specific markdown generator
 97:     run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
 98:         markdown_generator=markdown_generator_with_filter
 99:     )
100: 
101:     # 4. Run the crawl
102:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
103:         # Example URL (replace with a real page having relevant content)
104:         url_to_crawl = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy"
105:         print(f"\nCrawling {url_to_crawl}...")
106: 
107:         result = await crawler.arun(url=url_to_crawl, config=run_config)
108: 
109:         if result.success:
110:             print("\nCrawl successful!")
111:             print(f"Raw Markdown length: {len(result.markdown.raw_markdown)}")
112:             print(f"Fit Markdown length: {len(result.markdown.fit_markdown)}")
113: 
114:             # The fit_markdown should be shorter and focused on solar power
115:             print("\n--- Start of Fit Markdown (Solar Power Focus) ---")
116:             # Print first 500 chars of the filtered markdown
117:             print(result.markdown.fit_markdown[:500] + "...")
118:             print("--- End of Fit Markdown Snippet ---")
119:         else:
120:             print(f"\nCrawl failed: {result.error_message}")
121: 
122: if __name__ == "__main__":
123:     asyncio.run(main())
124: ```
125: 
126: **Explanation:**
127: 
128: 1.  **Create Filter:** We make an instance of `BM25ContentFilter`, telling it we're interested in "solar power technology".
129: 2.  **Create Generator:** We make an instance of `DefaultMarkdownGenerator` and pass our `solar_filter` to its `content_filter` parameter.
130: 3.  **Configure Run:** We create `CrawlerRunConfig` and tell it to use our special `markdown_generator_with_filter` for this run.
131: 4.  **Crawl & Check:** We run the crawl as usual. In the `result`, `result.markdown.raw_markdown` will have the markdown for the whole page, while `result.markdown.fit_markdown` will *only* contain markdown derived from the HTML parts that the `BM25ContentFilter` scored highly for relevance to "solar power technology". You'll likely see the `fit_markdown` is significantly shorter.
132: 
133: ### Example 2: Using `PruningContentFilter` to remove boilerplate
134: 
135: Now, let's try removing common noise like sidebars or footers based on structure, without needing a specific query.
136: 
137: ```python
138: # chapter5_example_2.py
139: import asyncio
140: from crawl4ai import (
141:     AsyncWebCrawler,
142:     CrawlerRunConfig,
143:     DefaultMarkdownGenerator,
144:     PruningContentFilter # The structural filter
145: )
146: 
147: async def main():
148:     # 1. Create the Pruning filter (no query needed)
149:     pruning_filter = PruningContentFilter()
150:     print("Filter created: PruningContentFilter (structural)")
151: 
152:     # 2. Create a Markdown generator that uses this filter
153:     markdown_generator_with_filter = DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
154:         content_filter=pruning_filter
155:     )
156:     print("Markdown generator configured with Pruning filter.")
157: 
158:     # 3. Create CrawlerRunConfig using this generator
159:     run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
160:         markdown_generator=markdown_generator_with_filter
161:     )
162: 
163:     # 4. Run the crawl
164:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
165:         # Example URL (replace with a real page that has boilerplate)
166:         url_to_crawl = "https://www.python.org/" # Python homepage likely has headers/footers
167:         print(f"\nCrawling {url_to_crawl}...")
168: 
169:         result = await crawler.arun(url=url_to_crawl, config=run_config)
170: 
171:         if result.success:
172:             print("\nCrawl successful!")
173:             print(f"Raw Markdown length: {len(result.markdown.raw_markdown)}")
174:             print(f"Fit Markdown length: {len(result.markdown.fit_markdown)}")
175: 
176:             # fit_markdown should have less header/footer/sidebar content
177:             print("\n--- Start of Fit Markdown (Pruned) ---")
178:             print(result.markdown.fit_markdown[:500] + "...")
179:             print("--- End of Fit Markdown Snippet ---")
180:         else:
181:             print(f"\nCrawl failed: {result.error_message}")
182: 
183: if __name__ == "__main__":
184:     asyncio.run(main())
185: ```
186: 
187: **Explanation:**
188: 
189: The structure is the same as the BM25 example, but:
190: 
191: 1.  We instantiate `PruningContentFilter()`, which doesn't require a `user_query`.
192: 2.  We pass this filter to the `DefaultMarkdownGenerator`.
193: 3.  The resulting `result.markdown.fit_markdown` should contain Markdown primarily from the main content areas of the page, with structurally identified boilerplate removed.
194: 
195: ### Example 3: Using `LLMContentFilter` (Conceptual)
196: 
197: Using `LLMContentFilter` follows the same pattern, but requires setting up LLM provider details.
198: 
199: ```python
200: # chapter5_example_3_conceptual.py
201: import asyncio
202: from crawl4ai import (
203:     AsyncWebCrawler,
204:     CrawlerRunConfig,
205:     DefaultMarkdownGenerator,
206:     LLMContentFilter,
207:     # Assume LlmConfig is set up correctly (see LLM-specific docs)
208:     # from crawl4ai.async_configs import LlmConfig
209: )
210: 
211: # Assume llm_config is properly configured with API keys, provider, etc.
212: # Example: llm_config = LlmConfig(provider="openai", api_token="env:OPENAI_API_KEY")
213: # For this example, we'll pretend it's ready.
214: class MockLlmConfig: # Mock for demonstration
215:     provider = "mock_provider"
216:     api_token = "mock_token"
217:     base_url = None
218: llm_config = MockLlmConfig()
219: 
220: 
221: async def main():
222:     # 1. Create the LLM filter with an instruction
223:     instruction = "Extract only the main news article content. Remove headers, footers, ads, comments, and related links."
224:     llm_filter = LLMContentFilter(
225:         instruction=instruction,
226:         llmConfig=llm_config # Pass the LLM configuration
227:     )
228:     print(f"Filter created: LLMContentFilter")
229:     print(f"Instruction: '{llm_filter.instruction}'")
230:

265: 
266: **Explanation:**
267: 
268: 1.  We create `LLMContentFilter`, providing our natural language `instruction` and the necessary `llmConfig` (which holds provider details and API keys - mocked here for simplicity).
269: 2.  We integrate it into `DefaultMarkdownGenerator` and `CrawlerRunConfig` as before.
270: 3.  When `arun` is called, the `LLMContentFilter` would (in a real scenario) interact with the configured LLM API, sending chunks of the `cleaned_html` and the instruction, then assembling the AI's response into the `fit_markdown`.
271: 
272: ## Under the Hood: How Filtering Fits In
273: 
274: The `RelevantContentFilter` doesn't run on its own; it's invoked by another component, typically the `DefaultMarkdownGenerator`.
275: 
276: Here's the sequence:
277: 
278: ```mermaid

286:     participant Result as CrawlResult

307:     AWC-->>User: Return CrawlResult
308: ```
309: 
310: **Code Glimpse:**
311: 
312: Inside `crawl4ai/markdown_generation_strategy.py`, the `DefaultMarkdownGenerator`'s `generate_markdown` method has logic like this (simplified):
313: 
314: ```python
315: # Simplified from markdown_generation_strategy.py
316: from .models import MarkdownGenerationResult
317: from .html2text import CustomHTML2Text
318: from .content_filter_strategy import RelevantContentFilter # Import filter base class
319: 
320: class DefaultMarkdownGenerator(MarkdownGenerationStrategy):
321:     # ... __init__ stores self.content_filter ...
322: 
323:     def generate_markdown(
324:         self,
325:         cleaned_html: str,
326:         # ... other params like base_url, options ...
327:         content_filter: Optional[RelevantContentFilter] = None,
328:         **kwargs,
329:     ) -> MarkdownGenerationResult:
330: 
331:         h = CustomHTML2Text(...) # Setup html2text converter
332:         # ... apply options ...
333: 
334:         # 1. Generate raw markdown from the full cleaned_html
335:         raw_markdown = h.handle(cleaned_html)
336:         # ... post-process raw_markdown ...
337: 
338:         # 2. Convert links to citations (if enabled)
339:         markdown_with_citations, references_markdown = self.convert_links_to_citations(...)
340: 
341:         # 3. Generate fit markdown IF a filter is available
342:         fit_markdown = ""
343:         filtered_html = ""
344:         # Use the filter passed directly, or the one stored during initialization
345:         active_filter = content_filter or self.content_filter
346:         if active_filter:
347:             try:
348:                 # Call the filter's main method
349:                 filtered_html_fragments = active_filter.filter_content(cleaned_html)
350:                 # Join fragments (assuming filter returns list of HTML strings)
351:                 filtered_html = "\n".join(filtered_html_fragments)
352:                 # Convert ONLY the filtered HTML to markdown
353:                 fit_markdown = h.handle(filtered_html)
354:             except Exception as e:
355:                 fit_markdown = f"Error during filtering: {e}"
356:                 # Log error...
357: 
358:         return MarkdownGenerationResult(
359:             raw_markdown=raw_markdown,
360:             markdown_with_citations=markdown_with_citations,
361:             references_markdown=references_markdown,
362:             fit_markdown=fit_markdown, # Contains the filtered result
363:             fit_html=filtered_html,     # The HTML fragments kept by the filter
364:         )
365: 
366: ```
367: 
368: And inside `crawl4ai/content_filter_strategy.py`, you find the blueprint and implementations:
369: 
370: ```python
371: # Simplified from content_filter_strategy.py
372: from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
373: from typing import List
374: # ... other imports like BeautifulSoup, BM25Okapi ...
375: 
376: class RelevantContentFilter(ABC):
377:     """Abstract base class for content filtering strategies"""
378:     def __init__(self, user_query: str = None, ...):
379:         self.user_query = user_query
380:         # ... common setup ...
381: 
382:     @abstractmethod
383:     def filter_content(self, html: str) -> List[str]:
384:         """
385:         Takes cleaned HTML, returns a list of HTML fragments
386:         deemed relevant by the specific strategy.
387:         """
388:         pass
389:     # ... common helper methods like extract_page_query, is_excluded ...
390: 
391: class BM25ContentFilter(RelevantContentFilter):
392:     def __init__(self, user_query: str = None, bm25_threshold: float = 1.0, ...):
393:         super().__init__(user_query)
394:         self.bm25_threshold = bm25_threshold
395:         # ... BM25 specific setup ...
396: 
397:     def filter_content(self, html: str) -> List[str]:
398:         # 1. Parse HTML (e.g., with BeautifulSoup)
399:         # 2. Extract text chunks (candidates)
400:         # 3. Determine query (user_query or extracted)
401:         # 4. Tokenize query and chunks
402:         # 5. Calculate BM25 scores for chunks vs query
403:         # 6. Filter chunks based on score and threshold
404:         # 7. Return the HTML string of the selected chunks
405:         # ... implementation details ...
406:         relevant_html_fragments = ["<p>Relevant paragraph 1...</p>", "<h2>Relevant Section</h2>..."] # Placeholder
407:         return relevant_html_fragments
408: 
409: # ... Implementations for PruningContentFilter and LLMContentFilter ...
410: ```
411: 
412: The key is that each filter implements the `filter_content` method, returning the list of HTML fragments it considers relevant. The `DefaultMarkdownGenerator` then uses these fragments to create the `fit_markdown`.
413: 
414: ## Conclusion
415: 
416: You've learned about `RelevantContentFilter`, Crawl4AI's "Relevance Sieve"!
417: 
418: *   It addresses the problem that even cleaned HTML can contain noise relative to a specific goal.
419: *   It acts as a strategy to filter cleaned HTML, keeping only the relevant parts.
420: *   Different filter types exist: `BM25ContentFilter` (keywords), `PruningContentFilter` (structure), and `LLMContentFilter` (AI/semantic).
421: *   It's typically used *within* the `DefaultMarkdownGenerator` to produce a focused `fit_markdown` output in the `CrawlResult`, alongside the standard `raw_markdown`.
422: *   You configure it by passing the chosen filter instance to the `DefaultMarkdownGenerator` and then passing that generator to the `CrawlerRunConfig`.
423: 
424: By using `RelevantContentFilter`, you can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the content you get from webpages, making downstream tasks like summarization or analysis more effective.
425: 
426: But what if just getting relevant *text* isn't enough? What if you need specific, *structured* data like product names, prices, and ratings from an e-commerce page, or names and affiliations from a list of conference speakers?
427: 
428: **Next:** Let's explore how to extract structured data with [Chapter 6: Getting Specific Data - ExtractionStrategy](06_extractionstrategy.md).

  8: # Chapter 6: Getting Specific Data - ExtractionStrategy
  9: 
 10: In the previous chapter, [Chapter 5: Focusing on What Matters - RelevantContentFilter](05_relevantcontentfilter.md), we learned how to sift through the cleaned webpage content to keep only the parts relevant to our query or goal, producing a focused `fit_markdown`. This is great for tasks like summarization or getting the main gist of an article.
 11: 
 12: But sometimes, we need more than just relevant text. Imagine you're analyzing an e-commerce website listing products. You don't just want the *description*; you need the exact **product name**, the specific **price**, the **customer rating**, and maybe the **SKU number**, all neatly organized. How do we tell Crawl4AI to find these *specific* pieces of information and return them in a structured format, like a JSON object?
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does `ExtractionStrategy` Solve?
 15: 
 16: Think of the content we've processed so far (like the cleaned HTML or the generated Markdown) as a detailed report delivered by a researcher. `RelevantContentFilter` helped trim the report down to the most relevant pages.
 17: 
 18: Now, we need to give specific instructions to an **Analyst** to go through that focused report and pull out precise data points. We don't just want the report; we want a filled-in spreadsheet with columns for "Product Name," "Price," and "Rating."
 19: 
 20: `ExtractionStrategy` is the set of instructions we give to this Analyst. It defines *how* to locate and extract specific, structured information (like fields in a database or keys in a JSON object) from the content.
 21: 
 22: ## What is `ExtractionStrategy`?
 23: 
 24: `ExtractionStrategy` is a core concept (a blueprint) in Crawl4AI that represents the **method used to extract structured data** from the processed content (which could be HTML or Markdown). It specifies *that* we need a way to find specific fields, but the actual *technique* used to find them can vary.
 25: 
 26: This allows us to choose the best "Analyst" for the job, depending on the complexity of the website and the data we need.
 27: 
 28: ## The Different Analysts: Ways to Extract Data
 29: 
 30: Crawl4AI offers several concrete implementations (the different Analysts) for extracting structured data:
 31: 
 32: 1.  **The Precise Locator (`JsonCssExtractionStrategy` & `JsonXPathExtractionStrategy`)**
 33:     *   **Analogy:** An analyst who uses very precise map coordinates (CSS Selectors or XPath expressions) to find information on a page. They need to be told exactly where to look. "The price is always in the HTML element with the ID `#product-price`."
 34:     *   **How it works:** You define a **schema** (a Python dictionary) that maps the names of the fields you want (e.g., "product_name", "price") to the specific CSS selector (`JsonCssExtractionStrategy`) or XPath expression (`JsonXPathExtractionStrategy`) that locates that information within the HTML structure.
 35:     *   **Pros:** Very fast and reliable if the website structure is consistent and predictable. Doesn't require external AI services.
 36:     *   **Cons:** Can break easily if the website changes its layout (selectors become invalid). Requires you to inspect the HTML and figure out the correct selectors.
 37:     *   **Input:** Typically works directly on the raw or cleaned HTML.
 38: 
 39: 2.  **The Smart Interpreter (`LLMExtractionStrategy`)**
 40:     *   **Analogy:** A highly intelligent analyst who can *read and understand* the content. You give them a list of fields you need (a schema) or even just natural language instructions ("Find the product name, its price, and a short description"). They read the content (usually Markdown) and use their understanding of language and context to figure out the values, even if the layout isn't perfectly consistent.
 41:     *   **How it works:** You provide a desired output schema (e.g., a Pydantic model or a dictionary structure) or a natural language instruction. The strategy sends the content (often the generated Markdown, possibly split into chunks) along with your schema/instruction to a configured Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT or Llama. The LLM reads the text and generates the structured data (usually JSON) according to your request.
 42:     *   **Pros:** Much more resilient to website layout changes. Can understand context and handle variations. Can extract data based on meaning, not just location.
 43:     *   **Cons:** Requires setting up access to an LLM (API keys, potentially costs). Can be significantly slower than selector-based methods. The quality of extraction depends on the LLM's capabilities and the clarity of your instructions/schema.
 44:     *   **Input:** Often works best on the cleaned Markdown representation of the content, but can sometimes use HTML.
 45: 
 46: ## How to Use an `ExtractionStrategy`
 47: 
 48: You tell the `AsyncWebCrawler` which extraction strategy to use (if any) by setting the `extraction_strategy` parameter within the [CrawlerRunConfig](03_crawlerrunconfig.md) object you pass to `arun` or `arun_many`.
 49: 
 50: ### Example 1: Extracting Data with `JsonCssExtractionStrategy`
 51: 
 52: Let's imagine we want to extract the title (from the `<h1>` tag) and the main heading (from the `<h1>` tag) of the simple `httpbin.org/html` page.
 53: 
 54: ```python
 55: # chapter6_example_1.py
 56: import asyncio
 57: import json
 58: from crawl4ai import (
 59:     AsyncWebCrawler,
 60:     CrawlerRunConfig,
 61:     JsonCssExtractionStrategy # Import the CSS strategy
 62: )
 63: 
 64: async def main():
 65:     # 1. Define the extraction schema (Field Name -> CSS Selector)
 66:     extraction_schema = {
 67:         "baseSelector": "body", # Operate within the body tag
 68:         "fields": [
 69:             {"name": "page_title", "selector": "title", "type": "text"},
 70:             {"name": "main_heading", "selector": "h1", "type": "text"}
 71:         ]
 72:     }
 73:     print("Extraction Schema defined using CSS selectors.")
 74: 
 75:     # 2. Create an instance of the strategy with the schema
 76:     css_extractor = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema=extraction_schema)
 77:     print(f"Using strategy: {css_extractor.__class__.__name__}")
 78: 
 79:     # 3. Create CrawlerRunConfig and set the extraction_strategy
 80:     run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
 81:         extraction_strategy=css_extractor
 82:     )
 83: 
 84:     # 4. Run the crawl
 85:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
 86:         url_to_crawl = "https://httpbin.org/html"
 87:         print(f"\nCrawling {url_to_crawl} to extract structured data...")
 88: 
 89:         result = await crawler.arun(url=url_to_crawl, config=run_config)
 90: 
 91:         if result.success and result.extracted_content:
 92:             print("\nExtraction successful!")
 93:             # The extracted data is stored as a JSON string in result.extracted_content
 94:             # Parse the JSON string to work with the data as a Python object
 95:             extracted_data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
 96:             print("Extracted Data:")
 97:             # Print the extracted data nicely formatted
 98:             print(json.dumps(extracted_data, indent=2))
 99:         elif result.success:
100:             print("\nCrawl successful, but no structured data extracted.")
101:         else:
102:             print(f"\nCrawl failed: {result.error_message}")
103: 
104: if __name__ == "__main__":
105:     asyncio.run(main())
106: ```
107: 
108: **Explanation:**
109: 
110: 1.  **Schema Definition:** We create a Python dictionary `extraction_schema`.
111:     *   `baseSelector: "body"` tells the strategy to look for items within the `<body>` tag of the HTML.
112:     *   `fields` is a list of dictionaries, each defining a field to extract:
113:         *   `name`: The key for this field in the output JSON (e.g., "page_title").
114:         *   `selector`: The CSS selector to find the element containing the data (e.g., "title" finds the `<title>` tag, "h1" finds the `<h1>` tag).
115:         *   `type`: How to get the data from the selected element (`"text"` means get the text content).
116: 2.  **Instantiate Strategy:** We create an instance of `JsonCssExtractionStrategy`, passing our `extraction_schema`. This strategy knows its input format should be HTML.
117: 3.  **Configure Run:** We create a `CrawlerRunConfig` and assign our `css_extractor` instance to the `extraction_strategy` parameter.
118: 4.  **Crawl:** We run `crawler.arun`. After fetching and basic scraping, the `AsyncWebCrawler` will see the `extraction_strategy` in the config and call our `css_extractor`.
119: 5.  **Result:** The `CrawlResult` object now contains a field called `extracted_content`. This field holds the structured data found by the strategy, formatted as a **JSON string**. We use `json.loads()` to convert this string back into a Python list/dictionary.
120: 
121: **Expected Output (Conceptual):**
122: 
123: ```
124: Extraction Schema defined using CSS selectors.
125: Using strategy: JsonCssExtractionStrategy
126: 
127: Crawling https://httpbin.org/html to extract structured data...
128: 
129: Extraction successful!
130: Extracted Data:
131: [
132:   {
133:     "page_title": "Herman Melville - Moby-Dick",
134:     "main_heading": "Moby Dick"
135:   }
136: ]
137: ```
138: *(Note: The actual output is a list containing one dictionary because `baseSelector: "body"` matches one element, and we extract fields relative to that.)*
139: 
140: ### Example 2: Extracting Data with `LLMExtractionStrategy` (Conceptual)
141: 
142: Now, let's imagine we want the same information (title, heading) but using an AI. We'll provide a schema describing what we want. (Note: This requires setting up LLM access separately, e.g., API keys).
143: 
144: ```python
145: # chapter6_example_2.py
146: import asyncio
147: import json
148: from crawl4ai import (
149:     AsyncWebCrawler,
150:     CrawlerRunConfig,
151:     LLMExtractionStrategy, # Import the LLM strategy
152:     LlmConfig             # Import LLM configuration helper
153: )
154: 
155: # Assume llm_config is properly configured with provider, API key, etc.
156: # This is just a placeholder - replace with your actual LLM setup
157: # E.g., llm_config = LlmConfig(provider="openai", api_token="env:OPENAI_API_KEY")
158: class MockLlmConfig: provider="mock"; api_token="mock"; base_url=None
159: llm_config = MockLlmConfig()
160: 
161: 
162: async def main():
163:     # 1. Define the desired output schema (what fields we want)
164:     #    This helps guide the LLM.
165:     output_schema = {
166:         "page_title": "string",
167:         "main_heading": "string"

214: 
215: ```
216: 
217: **Explanation:**
218: 
219: 1.  **Schema Definition:** We define a simple dictionary `output_schema` telling the LLM we want fields named "page_title" and "main_heading", both expected to be strings.
220: 2.  **Instantiate Strategy:** We create `LLMExtractionStrategy`, passing:
221:     *   `schema=output_schema`: Our desired output structure.
222:     *   `llmConfig=llm_config`: The configuration telling the strategy *which* LLM to use and how to authenticate (here, it's mocked).
223:     *   `input_format="markdown"`: Instructs the strategy to feed the generated Markdown content (from `result.markdown.raw_markdown`) to the LLM, which is often easier for LLMs to parse than raw HTML.
224: 3.  **Configure Run & Crawl:** Same as before, we set the `extraction_strategy` in `CrawlerRunConfig` and run the crawl.
225: 4.  **Result:** The `AsyncWebCrawler` calls the `llm_extractor`. The strategy sends the Markdown content and the schema instructions to the configured LLM. The LLM analyzes the text and (hopefully) returns a JSON object matching the schema. This JSON is stored as a string in `result.extracted_content`.
226: 
227: **Expected Output (Conceptual, with a real LLM):**
228: 
229: ```
230: Extraction Schema defined for LLM.
231: Using strategy: LLMExtractionStrategy
232: LLM Provider (mocked): mock
233: 
234: Crawling https://httpbin.org/html using LLM to extract...
235: 
236: Extraction successful (using LLM)!
237: Extracted Data:
238: [
239:   {
240:     "page_title": "Herman Melville - Moby-Dick",
241:     "main_heading": "Moby Dick"
242:   }
243: ]
244: ```
245: *(Note: LLM output format might vary slightly, but it aims to match the requested schema based on the content it reads.)*
246: 
247: ## How It Works Inside (Under the Hood)
248: 
249: When you provide an `extraction_strategy` in the `CrawlerRunConfig`, how does `AsyncWebCrawler` use it?
250: 
251: 1.  **Fetch & Scrape:** The crawler fetches the raw HTML ([AsyncCrawlerStrategy](01_asynccrawlerstrategy.md)) and performs initial cleaning/scraping ([ContentScrapingStrategy](04_contentscrapingstrategy.md)) to get `cleaned_html`, links, etc.
252: 2.  **Markdown Generation:** It usually generates Markdown representation ([DefaultMarkdownGenerator](05_relevantcontentfilter.md#how-relevantcontentfilter-is-used-via-markdown-generation)).
253: 3.  **Check for Strategy:** The `AsyncWebCrawler` (specifically in its internal `aprocess_html` method) checks if `config.extraction_strategy` is set.
254: 4.  **Execute Strategy:** If a strategy exists:
255:     *   It determines the required input format (e.g., "html" for `JsonCssExtractionStrategy`, "markdown" for `LLMExtractionStrategy` based on its `input_format` attribute).
256:     *   It retrieves the corresponding content (e.g., `result.cleaned_html` or `result.markdown.raw_markdown`).
257:     *   If the content is long and the strategy supports chunking (like `LLMExtractionStrategy`), it might first split the content into smaller chunks.
258:     *   It calls the strategy's `run` method, passing the content chunk(s).
259:     *   The strategy performs its logic (applying selectors, calling LLM API).
260:     *   The strategy returns the extracted data (typically as a list of dictionaries).
261: 5.  **Store Result:** The `AsyncWebCrawler` converts the returned structured data into a JSON string and stores it in `CrawlResult.extracted_content`.

286: ### Code Glimpse (`extraction_strategy.py`)
287: 
288: Inside the `crawl4ai` library, the file `extraction_strategy.py` defines the blueprint and the implementations.
289: 
290: **The Blueprint (Abstract Base Class):**

432: ## Conclusion
433: 
434: You've learned about `ExtractionStrategy`, Crawl4AI's way of giving instructions to an "Analyst" to pull out specific, structured data from web content.
435: 
436: *   It solves the problem of needing precise data points (like product names, prices) in an organized format, not just blocks of text.
437: *   You can choose your "Analyst":
438:     *   **Precise Locators (`JsonCssExtractionStrategy`, `JsonXPathExtractionStrategy`):** Use exact CSS/XPath selectors defined in a schema. Fast but brittle.
439:     *   **Smart Interpreter (`LLMExtractionStrategy`):** Uses an AI (LLM) guided by a schema or instructions. More flexible but slower and needs setup.
440: *   You configure the desired strategy within the [CrawlerRunConfig](03_crawlerrunconfig.md).
441: *   The extracted structured data is returned as a JSON string in the `CrawlResult.extracted_content` field.
442: 
443: Now that we understand how to fetch, clean, filter, and extract data, let's put it all together and look at the final package that Crawl4AI delivers after a crawl.
444: 
445: **Next:** Let's dive into the details of the output with [Chapter 7: Understanding the Results - CrawlResult](07_crawlresult.md).

  8: # Chapter 7: Understanding the Results - CrawlResult
  9: 
 10: In the previous chapter, [Chapter 6: Getting Specific Data - ExtractionStrategy](06_extractionstrategy.md), we learned how to teach Crawl4AI to act like an analyst, extracting specific, structured data points from a webpage using an `ExtractionStrategy`. We've seen how Crawl4AI can fetch pages, clean them, filter them, and even extract precise information.
 11: 
 12: But after all that work, where does all the gathered information go? When you ask the `AsyncWebCrawler` to crawl a URL using `arun()`, what do you actually get back?
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does `CrawlResult` Solve?
 15: 
 16: Imagine you sent a research assistant to the library (a website) with a set of instructions: "Find this book (URL), make a clean copy of the relevant chapter (clean HTML/Markdown), list all the cited references (links), take photos of the illustrations (media), find the author and publication date (metadata), and maybe extract specific quotes (structured data)."
 17: 
 18: When the assistant returns, they wouldn't just hand you a single piece of paper. They'd likely give you a folder containing everything you asked for: the clean copy, the list of references, the photos, the metadata notes, and the extracted quotes, all neatly organized. They might also include a note if they encountered any problems (errors).
 19: 
 20: `CrawlResult` is exactly this **final report folder** or **delivery package**. It's a single object that neatly contains *all* the information Crawl4AI gathered and processed for a specific URL during a crawl operation. Instead of getting lots of separate pieces of data back, you get one convenient container.
 21: 
 22: ## What is `CrawlResult`?
 23: 
 24: `CrawlResult` is a Python object (specifically, a Pydantic model, which is like a super-powered dictionary) that acts as a data container. It holds the results of a single crawl task performed by `AsyncWebCrawler.arun()` or one of the results from `arun_many()`.
 25: 
 26: Think of it as a toolbox filled with different tools and information related to the crawled page.
 27: 
 28: **Key Information Stored in `CrawlResult`:**
 29: 
 30: *   **`url` (string):** The original URL that was requested.
 31: *   **`success` (boolean):** Did the crawl complete without critical errors? `True` if successful, `False` otherwise. **Always check this first!**
 32: *   **`html` (string):** The raw, original HTML source code fetched from the page.
 33: *   **`cleaned_html` (string):** The HTML after initial cleaning by the [ContentScrapingStrategy](04_contentscrapingstrategy.md) (e.g., scripts, styles removed).
 34: *   **`markdown` (object):** An object containing different Markdown representations of the content.
 35:     *   `markdown.raw_markdown`: Basic Markdown generated from `cleaned_html`.
 36:     *   `markdown.fit_markdown`: Markdown generated *only* from content deemed relevant by a [RelevantContentFilter](05_relevantcontentfilter.md) (if one was used). Might be empty if no filter was applied.
 37:     *   *(Other fields like `markdown_with_citations` might exist)*
 38: *   **`extracted_content` (string):** If you used an [ExtractionStrategy](06_extractionstrategy.md), this holds the extracted structured data, usually formatted as a JSON string. `None` if no extraction was performed or nothing was found.
 39: *   **`metadata` (dictionary):** Information extracted from the page's metadata tags, like the page title (`metadata['title']`), description, keywords, etc.
 40: *   **`links` (object):** Contains lists of links found on the page.
 41:     *   `links.internal`: List of links pointing to the same website.
 42:     *   `links.external`: List of links pointing to other websites.
 43: *   **`media` (object):** Contains lists of media items found.
 44:     *   `media.images`: List of images (`<img>` tags).
 45:     *   `media.videos`: List of videos (`<video>` tags).
 46:     *   *(Other media types might be included)*
 47: *   **`screenshot` (string):** If you requested a screenshot (`screenshot=True` in `CrawlerRunConfig`), this holds the file path to the saved image. `None` otherwise.
 48: *   **`pdf` (bytes):** If you requested a PDF (`pdf=True` in `CrawlerRunConfig`), this holds the PDF data as bytes. `None` otherwise. (Note: Previously might have been a path, now often bytes).
 49: *   **`error_message` (string):** If `success` is `False`, this field usually contains details about what went wrong.
 50: *   **`status_code` (integer):** The HTTP status code received from the server (e.g., 200 for OK, 404 for Not Found).
 51: *   **`response_headers` (dictionary):** The HTTP response headers sent by the server.
 52: *   **`redirected_url` (string):** If the original URL redirected, this shows the final URL the crawler landed on.
 53: 
 54: ## Accessing the `CrawlResult`
 55: 
 56: You get a `CrawlResult` object back every time you `await` a call to `crawler.arun()`:
 57: 
 58: ```python
 59: # chapter7_example_1.py
 60: import asyncio
 61: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
 62: 
 63: async def main():
 64:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
 65:         url = "https://httpbin.org/html"
 66:         print(f"Crawling {url}...")
 67: 
 68:         # The 'arun' method returns a CrawlResult object
 69:         result: CrawlResult = await crawler.arun(url=url) # Type hint optional
 70: 
 71:         print("Crawl finished!")
 72:         # Now 'result' holds all the information
 73:         print(f"Result object type: {type(result)}")
 74: 
 75: if __name__ == "__main__":
 76:     asyncio.run(main())
 77: ```
 78: 
 79: **Explanation:**
 80: 
 81: 1.  We call `crawler.arun(url=url)`.
 82: 2.  The `await` keyword pauses execution until the crawl is complete.
 83: 3.  The value returned by `arun` is assigned to the `result` variable.
 84: 4.  This `result` variable is our `CrawlResult` object.
 85: 
 86: If you use `crawler.arun_many()`, it returns a list where each item is a `CrawlResult` object for one of the requested URLs (or an async generator if `stream=True`).
 87: 
 88: ## Exploring the Attributes: Using the Toolbox
 89: 
 90: Once you have the `result` object, you can access its attributes using dot notation (e.g., `result.success`, `result.markdown`).
 91: 
 92: **1. Checking for Success (Most Important!)**
 93: 
 94: Before you try to use any data, always check if the crawl was successful:
 95: 
 96: ```python
 97: # chapter7_example_2.py
 98: import asyncio
 99: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlResult # Import CrawlResult for type hint
100: 
101: async def main():
102:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
103:         url = "https://httpbin.org/html" # A working URL
104:         # url = "https://httpbin.org/status/404" # Try this URL to see failure
105:         result: CrawlResult = await crawler.arun(url=url)
106: 
107:         # --- ALWAYS CHECK 'success' FIRST! ---
108:         if result.success:
109:             print(f"✅ Successfully crawled: {result.url}")
110:             # Now it's safe to access other attributes
111:             print(f"   Page Title: {result.metadata.get('title', 'N/A')}")
112:         else:
113:             print(f"❌ Failed to crawl: {result.url}")
114:             print(f"   Error: {result.error_message}")
115:             print(f"   Status Code: {result.status_code}")
116: 
117: if __name__ == "__main__":
118:     asyncio.run(main())
119: ```
120: 
121: **Explanation:**
122: 
123: *   We use an `if result.success:` block.
124: *   If `True`, we proceed to access other data like `result.metadata`.
125: *   If `False`, we print the `result.error_message` and `result.status_code` to understand why it failed.
126: 
127: **2. Accessing Content (HTML, Markdown)**
128: 
129: ```python
130: # chapter7_example_3.py
131: import asyncio
132: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlResult
133: 
134: async def main():
135:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
136:         url = "https://httpbin.org/html"
137:         result: CrawlResult = await crawler.arun(url=url)
138: 
139:         if result.success:
140:             print("--- Content ---")
141:             # Print the first 150 chars of raw HTML
142:             print(f"Raw HTML snippet: {result.html[:150]}...")
143: 
144:             # Access the raw markdown
145:             if result.markdown: # Check if markdown object exists
146:                  print(f"Markdown snippet: {result.markdown.raw_markdown[:150]}...")
147:             else:
148:                  print("Markdown not generated.")
149:         else:
150:             print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")
151: 
152: if __name__ == "__main__":
153:     asyncio.run(main())
154: ```
155: 
156: **Explanation:**
157: 
158: *   We access `result.html` for the original HTML.
159: *   We access `result.markdown.raw_markdown` for the main Markdown content. Note the two dots: `result.markdown` gives the `MarkdownGenerationResult` object, and `.raw_markdown` accesses the specific string within it. We also check `if result.markdown:` first, just in case markdown generation failed for some reason.
160: 
161: **3. Getting Metadata, Links, and Media**
162: 
163: ```python
164: # chapter7_example_4.py
165: import asyncio
166: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlResult
167: 
168: async def main():
169:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
170:         url = "https://httpbin.org/links/10/0" # A page with links
171:         result: CrawlResult = await crawler.arun(url=url)
172: 
173:         if result.success:
174:             print("--- Metadata & Links ---")
175:             print(f"Title: {result.metadata.get('title', 'N/A')}")
176:             print(f"Found {len(result.links.internal)} internal links.")
177:             print(f"Found {len(result.links.external)} external links.")
178:             if result.links.internal:
179:                 print(f"  First internal link text: '{result.links.internal[0].text}'")
180:             # Similarly access result.media.images etc.
181:         else:
182:             print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")
183: 
184: if __name__ == "__main__":
185:     asyncio.run(main())
186: ```
187: 
188: **Explanation:**
189: 
190: *   `result.metadata` is a dictionary; use `.get()` for safe access.
191: *   `result.links` and `result.media` are objects containing lists (`internal`, `external`, `images`, etc.). We can check their lengths (`len()`) and access individual items by index (e.g., `[0]`).
192: 
193: **4. Checking for Extracted Data, Screenshots, PDFs**
194: 
195: ```python
196: # chapter7_example_5.py
197: import asyncio
198: import json
199: from crawl4ai import (
200:     AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlResult, CrawlerRunConfig,
201:     JsonCssExtractionStrategy # Example extractor
202: )
203: 
204: async def main():
205:     # Define a simple extraction strategy (from Chapter 6)
206:     schema = {"baseSelector": "body", "fields": [{"name": "heading", "selector": "h1", "type": "text"}]}
207:     extractor = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema=schema)
208: 
209:     # Configure the run to extract and take a screenshot
210:     config = CrawlerRunConfig(
211:         extraction_strategy=extractor,
212:         screenshot=True
213:     )
214: 
215:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
216:         url = "https://httpbin.org/html"
217:         result: CrawlResult = await crawler.arun(url=url, config=config)
218: 
219:         if result.success:
220:             print("--- Extracted Data & Media ---")
221:             # Check if structured data was extracted
222:             if result.extracted_content:
223:                 print("Extracted Data found:")
224:                 data = json.loads(result.extracted_content) # Parse the JSON string
225:                 print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))
226:             else:
227:                 print("No structured data extracted.")
228: 
229:             # Check if a screenshot was taken
230:             if result.screenshot:
231:                 print(f"Screenshot saved to: {result.screenshot}")
232:             else:
233:                 print("Screenshot not taken.")
234: 
235:             # Check for PDF (would be bytes if requested and successful)
236:             if result.pdf:
237:                  print(f"PDF data captured ({len(result.pdf)} bytes).")
238:             else:
239:                  print("PDF not generated.")
240:         else:
241:             print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")
242: 
243: if __name__ == "__main__":
244:     asyncio.run(main())
245: ```
246: 
247: **Explanation:**
248: 
249: *   We check if `result.extracted_content` is not `None` or empty before trying to parse it as JSON.
250: *   We check if `result.screenshot` is not `None` to see if the file path exists.
251: *   We check if `result.pdf` is not `None` to see if the PDF data (bytes) was captured.
252: 
253: ## How is `CrawlResult` Created? (Under the Hood)
254: 
255: You don't interact with the `CrawlResult` constructor directly. The `AsyncWebCrawler` creates it for you at the very end of the `arun` process, typically inside its internal `aprocess_html` method (or just before returning if fetching from cache).
256: 
257: Here's a simplified sequence:
258: 
259: 1.  **Fetch:** `AsyncWebCrawler` calls the [AsyncCrawlerStrategy](01_asynccrawlerstrategy.md) to get the raw `html`, `status_code`, `response_headers`, etc.
260: 2.  **Scrape:** It passes the `html` to the [ContentScrapingStrategy](04_contentscrapingstrategy.md) to get `cleaned_html`, `links`, `media`, `metadata`.
261: 3.  **Markdown:** It generates Markdown using the configured generator, possibly involving a [RelevantContentFilter](05_relevantcontentfilter.md), resulting in a `MarkdownGenerationResult` object.
262: 4.  **Extract (Optional):** If an [ExtractionStrategy](06_extractionstrategy.md) is configured, it runs it on the appropriate content (HTML or Markdown) to get `extracted_content`.
263: 5.  **Screenshot/PDF (Optional):** If requested, the fetching strategy captures the `screenshot` path or `pdf` data.
264: 6.  **Package:** `AsyncWebCrawler` gathers all these pieces (`url`, `html`, `cleaned_html`, the markdown object, `links`, `media`, `metadata`, `extracted_content`, `screenshot`, `pdf`, `success` status, `error_message`, etc.).
265: 7.  **Instantiate:** It creates the `CrawlResult` object, passing all the gathered data into its constructor.
266: 8.  **Return:** It returns this fully populated `CrawlResult` object to your code.
267: 
268: ## Code Glimpse (`models.py`)
269: 
270: The `CrawlResult` is defined in the `crawl4ai/models.py` file. It uses Pydantic, a library that helps define data structures with type hints and validation. Here's a simplified view:
271: 
272: ```python
273: # Simplified from crawl4ai/models.py
274: from pydantic import BaseModel, HttpUrl
275: from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Any
276: 
277: # Other related models (simplified)
278: class MarkdownGenerationResult(BaseModel):
279:     raw_markdown: str
280:     fit_markdown: Optional[str] = None
281:     # ... other markdown fields ...
282: 
283: class Links(BaseModel):
284:     internal: List[Dict] = []
285:     external: List[Dict] = []
286: 
287: class Media(BaseModel):
288:     images: List[Dict] = []
289:     videos: List[Dict] = []
290: 
291: # The main CrawlResult model
292: class CrawlResult(BaseModel):
293:     url: str
294:     html: str
295:     success: bool
296:     cleaned_html: Optional[str] = None
297:     media: Media = Media() # Use the Media model
298:     links: Links = Links() # Use the Links model
299:     screenshot: Optional[str] = None
300:     pdf: Optional[bytes] = None
301:     # Uses a private attribute and property for markdown for compatibility
302:     _markdown: Optional[MarkdownGenerationResult] = None # Actual storage
303:     extracted_content: Optional[str] = None # JSON string
304:     metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
305:     error_message: Optional[str] = None
306:     status_code: Optional[int] = None
307:     response_headers: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None
308:     redirected_url: Optional[str] = None
309:     # ... other fields like session_id, ssl_certificate ...
310: 
311:     # Custom property to access markdown data
312:     @property
313:     def markdown(self) -> Optional[MarkdownGenerationResult]:
314:         return self._markdown
315: 
316:     # Configuration for Pydantic
317:     class Config:
318:         arbitrary_types_allowed = True
319: 
320:     # Custom init and model_dump might exist for backward compatibility handling
321:     # ... (omitted for simplicity) ...
322: ```
323: 
324: **Explanation:**
325: 
326: *   It's defined as a `class CrawlResult(BaseModel):`.
327: *   Each attribute (like `url`, `html`, `success`) is defined with a type hint (like `str`, `bool`, `Optional[str]`). `Optional[str]` means the field can be a string or `None`.
328: *   Some attributes are themselves complex objects defined by other Pydantic models (like `media: Media`, `links: Links`).
329: *   The `markdown` field uses a common pattern (property wrapping a private attribute) to provide the `MarkdownGenerationResult` object while maintaining some backward compatibility. You access it simply as `result.markdown`.
330: 
331: ## Conclusion
332: 
333: You've now met the `CrawlResult` object – the final, comprehensive report delivered by Crawl4AI after processing a URL.
334: 
335: *   It acts as a **container** holding all gathered information (HTML, Markdown, metadata, links, media, extracted data, errors, etc.).
336: *   It's the **return value** of `AsyncWebCrawler.arun()` and `arun_many()`.
337: *   The most crucial attribute is **`success` (boolean)**, which you should always check first.
338: *   You can easily **access** all the different pieces of information using dot notation (e.g., `result.metadata['title']`, `result.markdown.raw_markdown`, `result.links.external`).
339: 
340: Understanding the `CrawlResult` is key to effectively using the information Crawl4AI provides.
341: 
342: So far, we've focused on crawling single pages or lists of specific URLs. But what if you want to start at one page and automatically discover and crawl linked pages, exploring a website more deeply?
343: 
344: **Next:** Let's explore how to perform multi-page crawls with [Chapter 8: Exploring Websites - DeepCrawlStrategy](08_deepcrawlstrategy.md).

  8: # Chapter 8: Exploring Websites - DeepCrawlStrategy
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 7: Understanding the Results - CrawlResult](07_crawlresult.md), we saw the final report (`CrawlResult`) that Crawl4AI gives us after processing a single URL. This report contains cleaned content, links, metadata, and maybe even extracted data.
 11: 
 12: But what if you want to explore a website *beyond* just the first page? Imagine you land on a blog's homepage. You don't just want the homepage content; you want to automatically discover and crawl all the individual blog posts linked from it. How can you tell Crawl4AI to act like an explorer, following links and venturing deeper into the website?
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does `DeepCrawlStrategy` Solve?
 15: 
 16: Think of the `AsyncWebCrawler.arun()` method we've used so far like visiting just the entrance hall of a vast library. You get information about that specific hall, but you don't automatically explore the adjoining rooms or different floors.
 17: 
 18: What if you want to systematically explore the library? You need a plan:
 19: 
 20: *   Do you explore room by room on the current floor before going upstairs? (Level by level)
 21: *   Do you pick one wing and explore all its rooms down to the very end before exploring another wing? (Go deep first)
 22: *   Do you have a map highlighting potentially interesting sections and prioritize visiting those first? (Prioritize promising paths)
 23: 
 24: `DeepCrawlStrategy` provides this **exploration plan**. It defines the logic for how Crawl4AI should discover and crawl new URLs starting from the initial one(s) by following the links it finds on each page. It turns the crawler from a single-page visitor into a website explorer.
 25: 
 26: ## What is `DeepCrawlStrategy`?
 27: 
 28: `DeepCrawlStrategy` is a concept (a blueprint) in Crawl4AI that represents the **method or logic used to navigate and crawl multiple pages by following links**. It tells the crawler *which links* to follow and in *what order* to visit them.
 29: 
 30: It essentially takes over the process when you call `arun()` if a deep crawl is requested, managing a queue or list of URLs to visit and coordinating the crawling of those URLs, potentially up to a certain depth or number of pages.
 31: 
 32: ## Different Exploration Plans: The Strategies
 33: 
 34: Crawl4AI provides several concrete exploration plans (implementations) for `DeepCrawlStrategy`:
 35: 
 36: 1.  **`BFSDeepCrawlStrategy` (Level-by-Level Explorer):**
 37:     *   **Analogy:** Like ripples spreading in a pond.
 38:     *   **How it works:** It first crawls the starting URL (Level 0). Then, it crawls all the valid links found on that page (Level 1). Then, it crawls all the valid links found on *those* pages (Level 2), and so on. It explores the website layer by layer.
 39:     *   **Good for:** Finding the shortest path to all reachable pages, getting a broad overview quickly near the start page.
 40: 
 41: 2.  **`DFSDeepCrawlStrategy` (Deep Path Explorer):**
 42:     *   **Analogy:** Like exploring one specific corridor in a maze all the way to the end before backtracking and trying another corridor.
 43:     *   **How it works:** It starts at the initial URL, follows one link, then follows a link from *that* page, and continues going deeper down one path as far as possible (or until a specified depth limit). Only when it hits a dead end or the limit does it backtrack and try another path.
 44:     *   **Good for:** Exploring specific branches of a website thoroughly, potentially reaching deeper pages faster than BFS (if the target is down a specific path).
 45: 
 46: 3.  **`BestFirstCrawlingStrategy` (Priority Explorer):**
 47:     *   **Analogy:** Like using a treasure map where some paths are marked as more promising than others.
 48:     *   **How it works:** This strategy uses a **scoring system**. It looks at all the discovered (but not yet visited) links and assigns a score to each one based on how "promising" it seems (e.g., does the URL contain relevant keywords? Is it from a trusted domain?). It then crawls the link with the *best* score first, regardless of its depth.
 49:     *   **Good for:** Focusing the crawl on the most relevant or important pages first, especially useful when you can't crawl the entire site and need to prioritize.
 50: 
 51: **Guiding the Explorer: Filters and Scorers**
 52: 
 53: Deep crawl strategies often work together with:
 54: 
 55: *   **Filters:** Rules that decide *if* a discovered link should even be considered for crawling. Examples:
 56:     *   `DomainFilter`: Only follow links within the starting website's domain.
 57:     *   `URLPatternFilter`: Only follow links matching a specific pattern (e.g., `/blog/posts/...`).
 58:     *   `ContentTypeFilter`: Avoid following links to non-HTML content like PDFs or images.
 59: *   **Scorers:** (Used mainly by `BestFirstCrawlingStrategy`) Rules that assign a score to a potential link to help prioritize it. Examples:
 60:     *   `KeywordRelevanceScorer`: Scores links higher if the URL contains certain keywords.
 61:     *   `PathDepthScorer`: Might score links differently based on how deep they are.
 62: 
 63: These act like instructions for the explorer: "Only explore rooms on this floor (filter)," "Ignore corridors marked 'Staff Only' (filter)," or "Check rooms marked with a star first (scorer)."
 64: 
 65: ## How to Use a `DeepCrawlStrategy`
 66: 
 67: You enable deep crawling by adding a `DeepCrawlStrategy` instance to your `CrawlerRunConfig`. Let's try exploring a website layer by layer using `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy`, going only one level deep from the start page.
 68: 
 69: ```python
 70: # chapter8_example_1.py
 71: import asyncio
 72: from crawl4ai import (
 73:     AsyncWebCrawler,
 74:     CrawlerRunConfig,
 75:     BFSDeepCrawlStrategy, # 1. Import the desired strategy
 76:     DomainFilter          # Import a filter to stay on the same site
 77: )
 78: 
 79: async def main():
 80:     # 2. Create an instance of the strategy
 81:     #    - max_depth=1: Crawl start URL (depth 0) + links found (depth 1)
 82:     #    - filter_chain: Use DomainFilter to only follow links on the same website
 83:     bfs_explorer = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
 84:         max_depth=1,
 85:         filter_chain=[DomainFilter()] # Stay within the initial domain
 86:     )
 87:     print(f"Strategy: BFS, Max Depth: {bfs_explorer.max_depth}")
 88: 
 89:     # 3. Create CrawlerRunConfig and set the deep_crawl_strategy
 90:     #    Also set stream=True to get results as they come in.
 91:     run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
 92:         deep_crawl_strategy=bfs_explorer,
 93:         stream=True # Get results one by one using async for
 94:     )
 95:

118: ```
119: 
120: **Explanation:**
121: 
122: 1.  **Import:** We import `AsyncWebCrawler`, `CrawlerRunConfig`, `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy`, and `DomainFilter`.
123: 2.  **Instantiate Strategy:** We create `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy`.
124:     *   `max_depth=1`: We tell it to crawl the starting URL (depth 0) and any valid links it finds on that page (depth 1), but not to go any further.
125:     *   `filter_chain=[DomainFilter()]`: We provide a list containing `DomainFilter`. This tells the strategy to only consider following links that point to the same domain as the `start_url`. Links to external sites will be ignored.
126: 3.  **Configure Run:** We create a `CrawlerRunConfig` and pass our `bfs_explorer` instance to the `deep_crawl_strategy` parameter. We also set `stream=True` so we can process results as soon as they are ready, rather than waiting for the entire crawl to finish.
127: 4.  **Crawl:** We call `await crawler.arun(url=start_url, config=run_config)`. Because the config contains a `deep_crawl_strategy`, `arun` doesn't just crawl the single `start_url`. Instead, it activates the deep crawl logic defined by `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy`.
128: 5.  **Process Results:** Since we used `stream=True`, the return value is an asynchronous generator. We use `async for result in crawl_results_generator:` to loop through the `CrawlResult` objects as they are produced by the deep crawl. For each result, we print its status and depth.
129: 
130: You'll see the output showing the crawl starting, then processing the initial page (`links/10/0` at depth 0), followed by the 10 linked pages (e.g., `9`, `8`, ... `0` at depth 1).
131: 
132: ## How It Works (Under the Hood)
133: 
134: How does simply putting a strategy in the config change `arun`'s behavior? It involves a bit of Python magic called a **decorator**.
135: 
136: 1.  **Decorator:** When you create an `AsyncWebCrawler`, its `arun` method is automatically wrapped by a `DeepCrawlDecorator`.
137: 2.  **Check Config:** When you call `await crawler.arun(url=..., config=...)`, this decorator checks if `config.deep_crawl_strategy` is set.
138: 3.  **Delegate or Run Original:**
139:     *   If a strategy **is set**, the decorator *doesn't* run the original single-page crawl logic. Instead, it calls the `arun` method of your chosen `DeepCrawlStrategy` instance (e.g., `bfs_explorer.arun(...)`), passing it the `crawler` itself, the `start_url`, and the `config`.
140:     *   If no strategy is set, the decorator simply calls the original `arun` logic to crawl the single page.
141: 4.  **Strategy Takes Over:** The `DeepCrawlStrategy`'s `arun` method now manages the crawl.
142:     *   It maintains a list or queue of URLs to visit (e.g., `current_level` in BFS, a stack in DFS, a priority queue in BestFirst).
143:     *   It repeatedly takes batches of URLs from its list/queue.
144:     *   For each batch, it calls `crawler.arun_many(urls=batch_urls, config=batch_config)` (with deep crawling disabled in `batch_config` to avoid infinite loops!).
145:     *   As results come back from `arun_many`, the strategy processes them:
146:         *   It yields the `CrawlResult` if running in stream mode.
147:         *   It extracts links using its `link_discovery` method.
148:         *   `link_discovery` uses `can_process_url` (which applies filters) to validate links.
149:         *   Valid new links are added to the list/queue for future crawling.
150:     *   This continues until the list/queue is empty, the max depth/pages limit is reached, or it's cancelled.

365: ## Conclusion
366: 
367: You've learned about `DeepCrawlStrategy`, the component that turns Crawl4AI into a website explorer!
368: 
369: *   It solves the problem of crawling beyond a single starting page by following links.
370: *   It defines the **exploration plan**:
371:     *   `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy`: Level by level.
372:     *   `DFSDeepCrawlStrategy`: Deep paths first.
373:     *   `BestFirstCrawlingStrategy`: Prioritized by score.
374: *   **Filters** and **Scorers** help guide the exploration.
375: *   You enable it by setting `deep_crawl_strategy` in the `CrawlerRunConfig`.
376: *   A decorator mechanism intercepts `arun` calls to activate the strategy.
377: *   The strategy manages the queue of URLs and uses `crawler.arun_many` to crawl them in batches.
378: 
379: Deep crawling allows you to gather information from multiple related pages automatically. But how does Crawl4AI avoid re-fetching the same page over and over again, especially during these deeper crawls? The answer lies in caching.
380: 
381: **Next:** Let's explore how Crawl4AI smartly caches results with [Chapter 9: Smart Fetching with Caching - CacheContext / CacheMode](09_cachecontext___cachemode.md).

  8: # Chapter 9: Smart Fetching with Caching - CacheContext / CacheMode
  9: 
 10: In the previous chapter, [Chapter 8: Exploring Websites - DeepCrawlStrategy](08_deepcrawlstrategy.md), we saw how Crawl4AI can explore websites by following links, potentially visiting many pages. During such explorations, or even when you run the same crawl multiple times, the crawler might try to fetch the exact same webpage again and again. This can be slow and might unnecessarily put a load on the website you're crawling. Wouldn't it be smarter to remember the result from the first time and just reuse it?
 11: 
 12: ## What Problem Does Caching Solve?
 13: 
 14: Imagine you need to download a large instruction manual (a webpage) from the internet.
 15: 
 16: *   **Without Caching:** Every single time you need the manual, you download the entire file again. This takes time and uses bandwidth every time.
 17: *   **With Caching:** The first time you download it, you save a copy on your computer (the "cache"). The next time you need it, you first check your local copy. If it's there, you use it instantly! You only download it again if you specifically want the absolute latest version or if your local copy is missing.
 18: 
 19: Caching in Crawl4AI works the same way. It's a mechanism to **store the results** of crawling a webpage locally (in a database file). When asked to crawl a URL again, Crawl4AI can check its cache first. If a valid result is already stored, it can return that saved result almost instantly, saving time and resources.
 20: 
 21: ## Introducing `CacheMode` and `CacheContext`
 22: 
 23: Crawl4AI uses two key concepts to manage this caching behavior:
 24: 
 25: 1.  **`CacheMode` (The Cache Policy):**
 26:     *   Think of this like setting the rules for how you interact with your saved instruction manuals.
 27:     *   It's an **instruction** you give the crawler for a specific run, telling it *how* to use the cache.
 28:     *   **Analogy:** Should you *always* use your saved copy if you have one? (`ENABLED`) Should you *ignore* your saved copies and always download a fresh one? (`BYPASS`) Should you *never* save any copies? (`DISABLED`) Should you save new copies but never reuse old ones? (`WRITE_ONLY`)
 29:     *   `CacheMode` lets you choose the caching behavior that best fits your needs for a particular task.
 30: 
 31: 2.  **`CacheContext` (The Decision Maker):**
 32:     *   This is an internal helper that Crawl4AI uses *during* a crawl. You don't usually interact with it directly.
 33:     *   It looks at the `CacheMode` you provided (the policy) and the type of URL being processed.
 34:     *   **Analogy:** Imagine a librarian who checks the library's borrowing rules (`CacheMode`) and the type of item you're requesting (e.g., a reference book that can't be checked out, like `raw:` HTML which isn't cached). Based on these, the librarian (`CacheContext`) decides if you can borrow an existing copy (read from cache) or if a new copy should be added to the library (write to cache).
 35:     *   It helps the main `AsyncWebCrawler` make the right decision about reading from or writing to the cache for each specific URL based on the active policy.
 36: 
 37: ## Setting the Cache Policy: Using `CacheMode`
 38: 
 39: You control the caching behavior by setting the `cache_mode` parameter within the `CrawlerRunConfig` object that you pass to `crawler.arun()` or `crawler.arun_many()`.
 40: 
 41: Let's explore the most common `CacheMode` options:
 42: 
 43: **1. `CacheMode.ENABLED` (The Default Behavior - If not specified)**
 44: 
 45: *   **Policy:** "Use the cache if a valid result exists. If not, fetch the page, save the result to the cache, and then return it."
 46: *   This is the standard, balanced approach. It saves time on repeated crawls but ensures you get the content eventually.
 47: *   *Note: In recent versions, the default if `cache_mode` is left completely unspecified might be `CacheMode.BYPASS`. Always check the documentation or explicitly set the mode for clarity.* For this tutorial, let's assume we explicitly set it.

 52: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
 53: 
 54: async def main():
 55:     url = "https://httpbin.org/html"
 56:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
 57:         # Explicitly set the mode to ENABLED
 58:         config_enabled = CrawlerRunConfig(cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED)
 59:         print(f"Running with CacheMode: {config_enabled.cache_mode.name}")
 60: 
 61:         # First run: Fetches, caches, and returns result
 62:         print("First run (ENABLED)...")
 63:         result1 = await crawler.arun(url=url, config=config_enabled)
 64:         print(f"Got result 1? {'Yes' if result1.success else 'No'}")
 65: 
 66:         # Second run: Finds result in cache and returns it instantly
 67:         print("Second run (ENABLED)...")
 68:         result2 = await crawler.arun(url=url, config=config_enabled)
 69:         print(f"Got result 2? {'Yes' if result2.success else 'No'}")
 70:         # This second run should be much faster!
 71: 
 72: if __name__ == "__main__":
 73:     asyncio.run(main())
 74: ```
 75: 
 76: **Explanation:**
 77: 
 78: *   We create a `CrawlerRunConfig` with `cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED`.
 79: *   The first `arun` call fetches the page from the web and saves the result in the cache.
 80: *   The second `arun` call (for the same URL and config affecting cache key) finds the saved result in the cache and returns it immediately, skipping the web fetch.
 81: 
 82: **2. `CacheMode.BYPASS`**
 83: 
 84: *   **Policy:** "Ignore any existing saved copy. Always fetch a fresh copy from the web. After fetching, save this new result to the cache (overwriting any old one)."
 85: *   Useful when you *always* need the absolute latest version of the page, but you still want to update the cache for potential future use with `CacheMode.ENABLED`.

117: ```
118: 
119: **Explanation:**
120: 
121: *   We set `cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS`.
122: *   Both the first and second `arun` calls will fetch the page directly from the web, ignoring any previously cached result. They will still write the newly fetched result to the cache. Notice both runs take roughly the same amount of time (network fetch time).
123: 
124: **3. `CacheMode.DISABLED`**
125: 
126: *   **Policy:** "Completely ignore the cache. Never read from it, never write to it."
127: *   Useful when you don't want Crawl4AI to interact with the cache files at all, perhaps for debugging or if you have storage constraints.

159: ```
160: 
161: **Explanation:**
162: 
163: *   We set `cache_mode=CacheMode.DISABLED`.
164: *   Both `arun` calls fetch fresh content from the web. Crucially, neither run reads from nor writes to the cache database.
165: 
166: **Other Modes (`READ_ONLY`, `WRITE_ONLY`):**
167: 
168: *   `CacheMode.READ_ONLY`: Only uses existing cached results. If a result isn't in the cache, it will fail or return an empty result rather than fetching it. Never saves anything new.
169: *   `CacheMode.WRITE_ONLY`: Never reads from the cache (always fetches fresh). It *only* writes the newly fetched result to the cache.
170: 
171: ## How Caching Works Internally
172: 
173: When you call `crawler.arun(url="...", config=...)`:
174: 
175: 1.  **Create Context:** The `AsyncWebCrawler` creates a `CacheContext` instance using the `url` and the `config.cache_mode`.
176: 2.  **Check Read:** It asks the `CacheContext`, "Should I read from the cache?" (`cache_context.should_read()`).
177: 3.  **Try Reading:** If `should_read()` is `True`, it asks the database manager ([`AsyncDatabaseManager`](async_database.py)) to look for a cached result for the `url`.
178: 4.  **Cache Hit?**
179:     *   If a valid cached result is found: The `AsyncWebCrawler` returns this cached `CrawlResult` immediately. Done!
180:     *   If no cached result is found (or if `should_read()` was `False`): Proceed to fetching.
181: 5.  **Fetch:** The `AsyncWebCrawler` calls the appropriate [AsyncCrawlerStrategy](01_asynccrawlerstrategy.md) to fetch the content from the web.
182: 6.  **Process:** It processes the fetched HTML (scraping, filtering, extracting) to create a new `CrawlResult`.
183: 7.  **Check Write:** It asks the `CacheContext`, "Should I write this result to the cache?" (`cache_context.should_write()`).
184: 8.  **Write Cache:** If `should_write()` is `True`, it tells the database manager to save the new `CrawlResult` into the cache database.
185: 9.  **Return:** The `AsyncWebCrawler` returns the newly created `CrawlResult`.

338: ## Conclusion
339: 
340: You've learned how Crawl4AI uses caching to avoid redundant work and speed up repeated crawls!
341: 
342: *   **Caching** stores results locally to reuse them later.
343: *   **`CacheMode`** is the policy you set in `CrawlerRunConfig` to control *how* the cache is used (`ENABLED`, `BYPASS`, `DISABLED`, etc.).
344: *   **`CacheContext`** is an internal helper that makes decisions based on the `CacheMode` and URL type.
345: *   Using the cache effectively (especially `CacheMode.ENABLED`) can significantly speed up your crawling tasks, particularly during development or when dealing with many URLs, including deep crawls.
346: 
347: We've seen how Crawl4AI can crawl single pages, lists of pages (`arun_many`), and even explore websites (`DeepCrawlStrategy`). But how does `arun_many` or a deep crawl manage running potentially hundreds or thousands of individual crawl tasks efficiently without overwhelming your system or the target website?
348: 
349: **Next:** Let's explore the component responsible for managing concurrent tasks: [Chapter 10: Orchestrating the Crawl - BaseDispatcher](10_basedispatcher.md).

  8: # Chapter 10: Orchestrating the Crawl - BaseDispatcher
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 9: Smart Fetching with Caching - CacheContext / CacheMode](09_cachecontext___cachemode.md), we learned how Crawl4AI uses caching to cleverly avoid re-fetching the same webpage multiple times, which is especially helpful when crawling many URLs. We've also seen how methods like `arun_many()` ([Chapter 2: Meet the General Manager - AsyncWebCrawler](02_asyncwebcrawler.md)) or strategies like [DeepCrawlStrategy](08_deepcrawlstrategy.md) can lead to potentially hundreds or thousands of individual URLs needing to be crawled.
 11: 
 12: This raises a question: if we have 1000 URLs to crawl, does Crawl4AI try to crawl all 1000 simultaneously? That would likely overwhelm your computer's resources (like memory and CPU) and could also flood the target website with too many requests, potentially getting you blocked! How does Crawl4AI manage running many crawls efficiently and responsibly?
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does `BaseDispatcher` Solve?
 15: 
 16: Imagine you're managing a fleet of delivery drones (`AsyncWebCrawler` tasks) that need to pick up packages from many different addresses (URLs). If you launch all 1000 drones at the exact same moment:
 17: 
 18: *   Your control station (your computer) might crash due to the processing load.
 19: *   The central warehouse (the target website) might get overwhelmed by simultaneous arrivals.
 20: *   Some drones might collide or interfere with each other.
 21: 
 22: You need a **Traffic Controller** or a **Dispatch Center** to manage the fleet. This controller decides:
 23: 
 24: 1.  How many drones can be active in the air at any one time.
 25: 2.  When to launch the next drone, maybe based on available airspace (system resources) or just a simple count limit.
 26: 3.  How to handle potential delays or issues (like rate limiting from a specific website).
 27: 
 28: In Crawl4AI, the `BaseDispatcher` acts as this **Traffic Controller** or **Task Scheduler** for concurrent crawling operations, primarily when using `arun_many()`. It manages *how* multiple crawl tasks are executed concurrently, ensuring the process is efficient without overwhelming your system or the target websites.
 29: 
 30: ## What is `BaseDispatcher`?
 31: 
 32: `BaseDispatcher` is an abstract concept (a blueprint or job description) in Crawl4AI. It defines *that* we need a system for managing the execution of multiple, concurrent crawling tasks. It specifies the *interface* for how the main `AsyncWebCrawler` interacts with such a system, but the specific *logic* for managing concurrency can vary.
 33: 
 34: Think of it as the control panel for our drone fleet – the panel exists, but the specific rules programmed into it determine how drones are dispatched.
 35: 
 36: ## The Different Controllers: Ways to Dispatch Tasks
 37: 
 38: Crawl4AI provides concrete implementations (the actual traffic control systems) based on the `BaseDispatcher` blueprint:
 39: 
 40: 1.  **`SemaphoreDispatcher` (The Simple Counter):**
 41:     *   **Analogy:** A parking garage with a fixed number of spots (e.g., 10). A gate (`asyncio.Semaphore`) only lets a new car in if one of the 10 spots is free.
 42:     *   **How it works:** You tell it the maximum number of crawls that can run *at the same time* (e.g., `semaphore_count=10`). It uses a simple counter (a semaphore) to ensure that no more than this number of crawls are active simultaneously. When one crawl finishes, it allows another one from the queue to start.
 43:     *   **Good for:** Simple, direct control over concurrency when you know a specific limit works well for your system and the target sites.
 44: 
 45: 2.  **`MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher` (The Resource-Aware Controller - Default):**
 46:     *   **Analogy:** A smart parking garage attendant who checks not just the number of cars, but also the *total space* they occupy (system memory). They might stop letting cars in if the garage is nearing its memory capacity, even if some numbered spots are technically free.
 47:     *   **How it works:** This dispatcher monitors your system's available memory. It tries to run multiple crawls concurrently (up to a configurable maximum like `max_session_permit`), but it will pause launching new crawls if the system memory usage exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., `memory_threshold_percent=90.0`). It adapts the concurrency level based on available resources.
 48:     *   **Good for:** Automatically adjusting concurrency to prevent out-of-memory errors, especially when crawl tasks vary significantly in resource usage. **This is the default dispatcher used by `arun_many` if you don't specify one.**
 49: 
 50: These dispatchers can also optionally work with a `RateLimiter` component, which adds politeness rules for specific websites (e.g., slowing down requests to a domain if it returns "429 Too Many Requests").
 51: 
 52: ## How `arun_many` Uses the Dispatcher
 53: 
 54: When you call `crawler.arun_many(urls=...)`, here's the basic flow involving the dispatcher:
 55: 
 56: 1.  **Get URLs:** `arun_many` receives the list of URLs you want to crawl.
 57: 2.  **Select Dispatcher:** It checks if you provided a specific `dispatcher` instance. If not, it creates an instance of the default `MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher`.
 58: 3.  **Delegate Execution:** It hands over the list of URLs and the `CrawlerRunConfig` to the chosen dispatcher's `run_urls` (or `run_urls_stream`) method.
 59: 4.  **Manage Tasks:** The dispatcher takes charge:
 60:     *   It iterates through the URLs.
 61:     *   For each URL, it decides *when* to start the actual crawl based on its rules (semaphore count, memory usage, rate limits).
 62:     *   When ready, it typically calls the single-page `crawler.arun(url, config)` method internally for that specific URL, wrapped within its concurrency control mechanism.
 63:     *   It manages the running tasks (e.g., using `asyncio.create_task` and `asyncio.wait`).
 64: 5.  **Collect Results:** As individual `arun` calls complete, the dispatcher collects their `CrawlResult` objects.
 65: 6.  **Return:** Once all URLs are processed, the dispatcher returns the list of results (or yields them if streaming).

 92: 
 93: ## Using the Dispatcher (Often Implicitly!)
 94: 
 95: Most of the time, you don't need to think about the dispatcher explicitly. When you use `arun_many`, the default `MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher` handles things automatically.
 96: 
 97: ```python
 98: # chapter10_example_1.py
 99: import asyncio
100: from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
101: 
102: async def main():
103:     urls_to_crawl = [
104:         "https://httpbin.org/html",
105:         "https://httpbin.org/links/5/0", # Page with 5 links
106:         "https://httpbin.org/robots.txt",
107:         "https://httpbin.org/status/200",
108:     ]
109: 
110:     # We DON'T specify a dispatcher here.
111:     # arun_many will use the default MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher.
112:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
113:         print(f"Crawling {len(urls_to_crawl)} URLs using the default dispatcher...")
114:         config = CrawlerRunConfig(stream=False) # Get results as a list at the end
115: 
116:         # The MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher manages concurrency behind the scenes.
117:         results = await crawler.arun_many(urls=urls_to_crawl, config=config)
118: 
119:         print(f"\nFinished! Got {len(results)} results.")
120:         for result in results:
121:             status = "✅" if result.success else "❌"
122:             url_short = result.url.split('/')[-1]
123:             print(f"  {status} {url_short:<15} | Title: {result.metadata.get('title', 'N/A')}")
124: 
125: if __name__ == "__main__":
126:     asyncio.run(main())
127: ```
128: 
129: **Explanation:**
130: 
131: *   We call `crawler.arun_many` without passing a `dispatcher` argument.
132: *   Crawl4AI automatically creates and uses a `MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher`.
133: *   This dispatcher runs the crawls concurrently, adapting to your system's memory, and returns all the results once completed (because `stream=False`). You benefit from concurrency without explicit setup.
134: 
135: ## Explicitly Choosing a Dispatcher
136: 
137: What if you want simpler, fixed concurrency? You can explicitly create and pass a `SemaphoreDispatcher`.
138: 
139: ```python
140: # chapter10_example_2.py
141: import asyncio
142: from crawl4ai import (
143:     AsyncWebCrawler,
144:     CrawlerRunConfig,
145:     SemaphoreDispatcher # 1. Import the specific dispatcher
146: )
147: 
148: async def main():
149:     urls_to_crawl = [
150:         "https://httpbin.org/delay/1", # Takes 1 second
151:         "https://httpbin.org/delay/1",
152:         "https://httpbin.org/delay/1",
153:         "https://httpbin.org/delay/1",
154:         "https://httpbin.org/delay/1",
155:     ]
156: 
157:     # 2. Create an instance of the SemaphoreDispatcher
158:     #    Allow only 2 crawls to run at the same time.
159:     semaphore_controller = SemaphoreDispatcher(semaphore_count=2)
160:     print(f"Using SemaphoreDispatcher with limit: {semaphore_controller.semaphore_count}")
161: 
162:     async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
163:         print(f"Crawling {len(urls_to_crawl)} URLs with explicit dispatcher...")
164:         config = CrawlerRunConfig(stream=False)
165: 
166:         # 3. Pass the dispatcher instance to arun_many
167:         results = await crawler.arun_many(
168:             urls=urls_to_crawl,
169:             config=config,
170:             dispatcher=semaphore_controller # Pass our controller
171:         )
172: 
173:         print(f"\nFinished! Got {len(results)} results.")
174:         # This crawl likely took around 3 seconds (5 tasks, 1s each, 2 concurrent = ceil(5/2)*1s)
175:         for result in results:
176:             status = "✅" if result.success else "❌"
177:             print(f"  {status} {result.url}")
178: 
179: if __name__ == "__main__":
180:     asyncio.run(main())
181: ```
182: 
183: **Explanation:**
184: 
185: 1.  **Import:** We import `SemaphoreDispatcher`.
186: 2.  **Instantiate:** We create `SemaphoreDispatcher(semaphore_count=2)`, limiting concurrency to 2 simultaneous crawls.
187: 3.  **Pass Dispatcher:** We pass our `semaphore_controller` instance directly to the `dispatcher` parameter of `arun_many`.
188: 4.  **Execution:** Now, `arun_many` uses our `SemaphoreDispatcher`. It will start the first two crawls. As one finishes, it will start the next one from the list, always ensuring no more than two are running concurrently.
189: 
190: ## A Glimpse Under the Hood
191: 
192: Where are these dispatchers defined? In `crawl4ai/async_dispatcher.py`.
193:

369: 
370:     # run_urls_stream would have similar logic but use asyncio.as_completed
371:     # or manage tasks manually to yield results as they finish.
372: ```
373: 
374: The key takeaway is that the `Dispatcher` orchestrates calls to the single-page `crawler.arun` method, wrapping them with concurrency controls (like the `async with semaphore:` block) before running them using `asyncio`'s concurrency tools (`asyncio.create_task`, `asyncio.gather`, etc.).
375: 
376: ## Conclusion
377: 
378: You've learned about `BaseDispatcher`, the crucial "Traffic Controller" that manages concurrent crawls in Crawl4AI, especially for `arun_many`.
379: 
380: *   It solves the problem of efficiently running many crawls without overloading systems or websites.
381: *   It acts as a **blueprint** for managing concurrency.
382: *   Key implementations:
383:     *   **`SemaphoreDispatcher`**: Uses a simple count limit.
384:     *   **`MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher`**: Adjusts concurrency based on system memory (the default for `arun_many`).
385: *   The dispatcher is used **automatically** by `arun_many`, but you can provide a specific instance if needed.
386: *   It orchestrates the execution of individual crawl tasks, respecting defined limits.
387: 
388: Understanding the dispatcher helps appreciate how Crawl4AI handles large-scale crawling tasks responsibly and efficiently.
389: 
390: This concludes our tour of the core concepts in Crawl4AI! We've covered how pages are fetched, how the process is managed, how content is cleaned, filtered, and extracted, how deep crawls are performed, how caching optimizes fetches, and finally, how concurrency is managed. You now have a solid foundation to start building powerful web data extraction and processing applications with Crawl4AI. Happy crawling!

12: `Crawl4AI`<sup>[View Repo](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai/tree/9c58e4ce2ee025debd3f36bf213330bd72b90e46/crawl4ai)</sup> is a flexible Python library for *asynchronously crawling websites* and *extracting structured content*, specifically designed for **AI use cases**.
13: You primarily interact with the `AsyncWebCrawler`, which acts as the main coordinator. You provide it with URLs and a `CrawlerRunConfig` detailing *how* to crawl (e.g., using specific strategies for fetching, scraping, filtering, and extraction).
14: It can handle single pages or multiple URLs concurrently using a `BaseDispatcher`, optionally crawl deeper by following links via `DeepCrawlStrategy`, manage `CacheMode`, and apply `RelevantContentFilter` before finally returning a `CrawlResult` containing all the gathered data.

  8: # Chapter 1: Crew - Your AI Team Manager
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the world of CrewAI! We're excited to help you build teams of AI agents that can work together to accomplish complex tasks.
 11: 
 12: Imagine you have a big project, like planning a surprise birthday trip for a friend. Doing it all yourself – researching destinations, checking flight prices, finding hotels, planning activities – can be overwhelming. Wouldn't it be great if you had a team to help? Maybe one person researches cool spots, another finds the best travel deals, and you coordinate everything.
 13: 
 14: That's exactly what a `Crew` does in CrewAI! It acts like the **project manager** or even the **entire team** itself, bringing together specialized AI assistants ([Agents](02_agent.md)) and telling them what [Tasks](03_task.md) to do and in what order.
 15: 
 16: **What Problem Does `Crew` Solve?**
 17: 
 18: Single AI models are powerful, but complex goals often require multiple steps and different kinds of expertise. A `Crew` allows you to break down a big goal into smaller, manageable [Tasks](03_task.md) and assign each task to the best AI [Agent](02_agent.md) for the job. It then manages how these agents work together to achieve the overall objective.
 19: 
 20: ## What is a Crew?
 21: 
 22: Think of a `Crew` as the central coordinator. It holds everything together:
 23: 
 24: 1.  **The Team ([Agents](02_agent.md)):** It knows which AI agents are part of the team. Each agent might have a specific role (like 'Travel Researcher' or 'Booking Specialist').
 25: 2.  **The Plan ([Tasks](03_task.md)):** It holds the list of tasks that need to be completed to achieve the final goal (e.g., 'Research European cities', 'Find affordable flights', 'Book hotel').
 26: 3.  **The Workflow ([Process](05_process.md)):** It defines *how* the team works. Should they complete tasks one after another (`sequential`)? Or should there be a manager agent delegating work (`hierarchical`)?
 27: 4.  **Collaboration:** It orchestrates how agents share information and pass results from one task to the next.
 28: 
 29: ## Let's Build a Simple Crew!
 30: 
 31: Let's try building a very basic `Crew` for our trip planning example. For now, we'll just set up the structure. We'll learn more about creating sophisticated [Agents](02_agent.md) and [Tasks](03_task.md) in the next chapters.
 32: 
 33: ```python
 34: # Import necessary classes (we'll learn about these soon!)
 35: from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
 36: 
 37: # Define our agents (don't worry about the details for now)
 38: # Agent 1: The Researcher
 39: researcher = Agent(
 40:   role='Travel Researcher',
 41:   goal='Find interesting cities in Europe for a birthday trip',
 42:   backstory='An expert travel researcher.',
 43:   # verbose=True, # Optional: Shows agent's thinking process
 44:   allow_delegation=False # This agent doesn't delegate work
 45:   # llm=your_llm # We'll cover LLMs later!
 46: )
 47: 
 48: # Agent 2: The Planner
 49: planner = Agent(
 50:   role='Activity Planner',
 51:   goal='Create a fun 3-day itinerary for the chosen city',
 52:   backstory='An experienced activity planner.',
 53:   # verbose=True,
 54:   allow_delegation=False
 55:   # llm=your_llm
 56: )
 57: ```
 58: 
 59: **Explanation:**
 60: 
 61: *   We import `Agent`, `Task`, `Crew`, and `Process` from the `crewai` library.
 62: *   We create two simple [Agents](02_agent.md). We give them a `role` and a `goal`. Think of these as job titles and descriptions for our AI assistants. (We'll dive deep into Agents in [Chapter 2](02_agent.md)).
 63: 
 64: Now, let's define the [Tasks](03_task.md) for these agents:
 65: 
 66: ```python
 67: # Define the tasks
 68: task1 = Task(
 69:   description='Identify the top 3 European cities suitable for a sunny birthday trip in May.',
 70:   expected_output='A list of 3 cities with brief reasons.',
 71:   agent=researcher # Assign task1 to the researcher agent
 72: )
 73: 
 74: task2 = Task(
 75:   description='Based on the chosen city from task 1, create a 3-day activity plan.',
 76:   expected_output='A detailed itinerary for 3 days.',
 77:   agent=planner # Assign task2 to the planner agent
 78: )
 79: ```
 80: 
 81: **Explanation:**
 82: 
 83: *   We create two [Tasks](03_task.md). Each task has a `description` (what to do) and an `expected_output` (what the result should look like).
 84: *   Crucially, we assign each task to an `agent`. `task1` goes to the `researcher`, and `task2` goes to the `planner`. (More on Tasks in [Chapter 3](03_task.md)).
 85: 
 86: Finally, let's assemble the `Crew`:
 87: 
 88: ```python
 89: # Create the Crew
 90: trip_crew = Crew(
 91:   agents=[researcher, planner],
 92:   tasks=[task1, task2],
 93:   process=Process.sequential # Tasks will run one after another
 94:   # verbose=2 # Optional: Sets verbosity level for the crew execution
 95: )
 96: 
 97: # Start the Crew's work!
 98: result = trip_crew.kickoff()
 99: 
100: print("\n\n########################")
101: print("## Here is the result")
102: print("########################\n")
103: print(result)
104: ```
105: 
106: **Explanation:**
107: 
108: 1.  We create an instance of the `Crew` class.
109: 2.  We pass the list of `agents` we defined earlier.
110: 3.  We pass the list of `tasks`. The order in this list matters for the sequential process.
111: 4.  We set the `process` to `Process.sequential`. This means `task1` will be completed first by the `researcher`, and its output will *automatically* be available as context for `task2` when the `planner` starts working.
112: 5.  We call the `kickoff()` method. This is like saying "Okay team, start working!"
113: 6.  The `Crew` manages the execution, ensuring the `researcher` does `task1`, then the `planner` does `task2`.
114: 7.  The `result` will contain the final output from the *last* task (`task2` in this case).
115: 
116: **Expected Outcome (Conceptual):**
117: 
118: When you run this (assuming you have underlying AI models configured, which we'll cover in the [LLM chapter](06_llm.md)), the `Crew` will:
119: 
120: 1.  Ask the `researcher` agent to perform `task1`.
121: 2.  The `researcher` will (conceptually) think and produce a list like: "1. Barcelona (Sunny, vibrant) 2. Lisbon (Coastal, historic) 3. Rome (Iconic, warm)".
122: 3.  The `Crew` takes this output and gives it to the `planner` agent along with `task2`.
123: 4.  The `planner` agent uses the city list (and likely picks one, or you'd refine the task) and creates a 3-day itinerary.
124: 5.  The final `result` printed will be the 3-day itinerary generated by the `planner`.
125: 
126: ## How Does `Crew.kickoff()` Work Inside?
127: 
128: You don't *need* to know the deep internals to use CrewAI, but understanding the basics helps! When you call `kickoff()`:
129: 
130: 1.  **Input Check:** It checks if you provided any starting inputs (we didn't in this simple example, but you could provide a starting topic or variable).
131: 2.  **Agent & Task Setup:** It makes sure all agents and tasks are ready to go. It ensures agents have the necessary configurations ([LLMs](06_llm.md), [Tools](04_tool.md) - more on these later!).
132: 3.  **Process Execution:** It looks at the chosen `process` (e.g., `sequential`).
133:     *   **Sequential:** It runs tasks one by one. The output of task `N` is added to the context for task `N+1`.
134:     *   **Hierarchical (Advanced):** If you chose this process, the Crew would use a dedicated 'manager' agent to coordinate the other agents and decide who does what next. We'll stick to sequential for now.
135: 4.  **Task Execution Loop:**
136:     *   It picks the next task based on the process.
137:     *   It finds the assigned agent for that task.
138:     *   It gives the agent the task description and any relevant context (like outputs from previous tasks).
139:     *   The agent performs the task using its underlying AI model ([LLM](06_llm.md)).
140:     *   The agent returns the result (output) of the task.
141:     *   The Crew stores this output.
142:     *   Repeat until all tasks are done.
143: 5.  **Final Output:** The `Crew` packages the output from the final task (and potentially outputs from all tasks) and returns it.
144: 
145: Let's visualize the `sequential` process:
146: 
147: ```mermaid
148: sequenceDiagram
149:     participant User
150:     participant MyCrew as Crew
151:     participant ResearcherAgent as Researcher
152:     participant PlannerAgent as Planner
153: 
154:     User->>MyCrew: kickoff()
155:     MyCrew->>ResearcherAgent: Execute Task 1 ("Find cities...")
156:     Note right of ResearcherAgent: Researcher thinks... generates city list.
157:     ResearcherAgent-->>MyCrew: Task 1 Output ("Barcelona, Lisbon, Rome...")
158:     MyCrew->>PlannerAgent: Execute Task 2 ("Create itinerary...") \nwith Task 1 Output as context
159:     Note right of PlannerAgent: Planner thinks... uses city list, creates itinerary.
160:     PlannerAgent-->>MyCrew: Task 2 Output ("Day 1: ..., Day 2: ...")
161:     MyCrew-->>User: Final Result (Task 2 Output)
162: ```
163: 
164: **Code Glimpse (`crew.py` simplified):**
165: 
166: The `Crew` class itself is defined in `crewai/crew.py`. It takes parameters like `agents`, `tasks`, and `process` when you create it.
167: 
168: ```python
169: # Simplified view from crewai/crew.py
170: class Crew(BaseModel):
171:     tasks: List[Task] = Field(default_factory=list)
172:     agents: List[BaseAgent] = Field(default_factory=list)
173:     process: Process = Field(default=Process.sequential)
174:     # ... other configurations like memory, cache, etc.
175: 
176:     def kickoff(self, inputs: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> CrewOutput:
177:         # ... setup steps ...
178: 
179:         # Decides which execution path based on the process
180:         if self.process == Process.sequential:
181:             result = self._run_sequential_process()
182:         elif self.process == Process.hierarchical:
183:             result = self._run_hierarchical_process()
184:         else:
185:             # Handle other processes or errors
186:             raise NotImplementedError(...)
187: 
188:         # ... cleanup and formatting steps ...
189:         return result # Returns a CrewOutput object
190: 
191:     def _run_sequential_process(self) -> CrewOutput:
192:         # Simplified loop logic
193:         task_outputs = []
194:         for task in self.tasks:
195:             agent = task.agent # Find the agent for this task
196:             context = self._get_context(task, task_outputs) # Get outputs from previous tasks
197:             # Execute the task (sync or async)
198:             output = task.execute_sync(agent=agent, context=context)
199:             task_outputs.append(output)
200:             # ... logging/callbacks ...
201:         return self._create_crew_output(task_outputs) # Package final result
202: ```
203: 
204: This simplified view shows how the `Crew` holds the `agents` and `tasks`, and the `kickoff` method directs traffic based on the chosen `process`, eventually looping through tasks sequentially if `Process.sequential` is selected.
205: 
206: ## Conclusion
207: 
208: You've learned about the most fundamental concept in CrewAI: the `Crew`! It's the manager that brings your AI agents together, gives them tasks, and defines how they collaborate to achieve a larger goal. We saw how to define agents and tasks (at a high level) and assemble them into a `Crew` using a `sequential` process.
209: 
210: But a Crew is nothing without its members! In the next chapter, we'll dive deep into the first core component: the [Agent](02_agent.md). What makes an agent tick? How do you define their roles, goals, and capabilities? Let's find out!

  8: # Chapter 2: Agent - Your Specialized AI Worker
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1](01_crew.md), we learned about the `Crew` – the manager that organizes our AI team. But a manager needs a team to manage! That's where `Agent`s come in.
 11: 
 12: ## Why Do We Need Agents?
 13: 
 14: Imagine our trip planning `Crew` again. The `Crew` knows the overall goal (plan a surprise trip), but it doesn't *do* the research or the planning itself. It needs specialists.
 15: 
 16: *   One specialist could be excellent at researching travel destinations.
 17: *   Another could be fantastic at creating detailed itineraries.
 18: 
 19: In CrewAI, these specialists are called **`Agent`s**. Instead of having one super-smart AI try to juggle everything, we create multiple `Agent`s, each with its own focus and expertise. This makes complex tasks more manageable and often leads to better results.
 20: 
 21: **Problem Solved:** `Agent`s allow you to break down a large task into smaller pieces and assign each piece to an AI worker specifically designed for it.
 22: 
 23: ## What is an Agent?
 24: 
 25: Think of an `Agent` as a **dedicated AI worker** on your `Crew`. Each `Agent` has a unique profile that defines who they are and what they do:
 26: 
 27: 1.  **`role`**: This is the Agent's job title. What function do they perform in the team? Examples: 'Travel Researcher', 'Marketing Analyst', 'Code Reviewer', 'Blog Post Writer'.
 28: 2.  **`goal`**: This is the Agent's primary objective. What specific outcome are they trying to achieve within their role? Examples: 'Find the top 3 family-friendly European destinations', 'Analyze competitor website traffic', 'Identify bugs in Python code', 'Draft an engaging blog post about AI'.
 29: 3.  **`backstory`**: This is the Agent's personality, skills, and history. It tells the AI *how* to behave and what expertise it possesses. It adds flavour and context. Examples: 'An expert travel agent with 20 years of experience in European travel.', 'A data-driven market analyst known for spotting emerging trends.', 'A meticulous senior software engineer obsessed with code quality.', 'A witty content creator known for simplifying complex topics.'
 30: 4.  **`llm`** (Optional): This is the Agent's "brain" – the specific Large Language Model (like GPT-4, Gemini, etc.) it uses to think, communicate, and execute tasks. We'll cover this more in the [LLM chapter](06_llm.md). If not specified, it usually inherits the `Crew`'s default LLM.
 31: 5.  **`tools`** (Optional): These are special capabilities the Agent can use, like searching the web, using a calculator, or reading files. Think of them as the Agent's equipment. We'll explore these in the [Tool chapter](04_tool.md).
 32: 6.  **`allow_delegation`** (Optional, default `False`): Can this Agent ask other Agents in the `Crew` for help with a sub-task? If `True`, it enables collaboration.
 33: 7.  **`verbose`** (Optional, default `False`): If `True`, the Agent will print out its thought process as it works, which is great for debugging and understanding what's happening.
 34: 
 35: An Agent takes the [Tasks](03_task.md) assigned to it by the `Crew` and uses its `role`, `goal`, `backstory`, `llm`, and `tools` to complete them.
 36: 
 37: ## Let's Define an Agent!
 38: 
 39: Let's revisit the `researcher` Agent from Chapter 1 and look closely at how it's defined.
 40: 
 41: ```python
 42: # Make sure you have crewai installed
 43: # pip install crewai
 44: 
 45: from crewai import Agent
 46: 
 47: # Define our researcher agent
 48: researcher = Agent(
 49:   role='Expert Travel Researcher',
 50:   goal='Find the most exciting and sunny European cities for a birthday trip in late May.',
 51:   backstory=(
 52:       "You are a world-class travel researcher with deep knowledge of "
 53:       "European destinations. You excel at finding hidden gems and understanding "
 54:       "weather patterns. Your recommendations are always insightful and tailored."
 55:   ),
 56:   verbose=True, # We want to see the agent's thinking process
 57:   allow_delegation=False # This agent focuses on its own research
 58:   # tools=[...] # We'll add tools later!
 59:   # llm=your_llm # We'll cover LLMs later!
 60: )
 61: 
 62: # (You would typically define other agents, tasks, and a crew here)
 63: # print(researcher) # Just to see the object
 64: ```
 65: 
 66: **Explanation:**
 67: 
 68: *   `from crewai import Agent`: We import the necessary `Agent` class.
 69: *   `role='Expert Travel Researcher'`: We clearly define the agent's job title. This tells the LLM its primary function.
 70: *   `goal='Find the most exciting...'`: We give it a specific, measurable objective. This guides its actions.
 71: *   `backstory='You are a world-class...'`: We provide context and personality. This influences the *style* and *quality* of its output. Notice the detailed description – this helps the LLM adopt the persona.
 72: *   `verbose=True`: We'll see detailed logs of this agent's thoughts and actions when it runs.
 73: *   `allow_delegation=False`: This researcher won't ask other agents for help; it will complete its task independently.
 74: 
 75: Running this code snippet creates an `Agent` object in Python. This object is now ready to be added to a [Crew](01_crew.md) and assigned [Tasks](03_task.md).
 76: 
 77: ## How Agents Work "Under the Hood"
 78: 
 79: So, what happens when an `Agent` is given a task by the `Crew`?
 80: 
 81: 1.  **Receive Task & Context:** The `Agent` gets the task description (e.g., "Find 3 sunny cities") and potentially some context from previous tasks (e.g., "The user prefers coastal cities").
 82: 2.  **Consult Profile:** It looks at its own `role`, `goal`, and `backstory`. This helps it frame *how* to tackle the task. Our 'Expert Travel Researcher' will approach this differently than a 'Budget Backpacker Blogger'.
 83: 3.  **Think & Plan (Using LLM):** The `Agent` uses its assigned `llm` (its brain) to think. It breaks down the task, formulates a plan, and decides what information it needs. This often involves an internal "monologue" (which you can see if `verbose=True`).
 84: 4.  **Use Tools (If Necessary):** If the plan requires external information or actions (like searching the web for current weather or calculating travel times), and the agent *has* the right [Tools](04_tool.md), it will use them.
 85: 5.  **Delegate (If Allowed & Necessary):** If `allow_delegation=True` and the `Agent` decides a sub-part of the task is better handled by another specialist `Agent` in the `Crew`, it can ask the `Crew` to delegate that part.
 86: 6.  **Generate Output (Using LLM):** Based on its thinking, tool results, and potentially delegated results, the `Agent` uses its `llm` again to formulate the final response or output for the task.
 87: 7.  **Return Result:** The `Agent` passes its completed work back to the `Crew`.
 88: 
 89: Let's visualize this simplified flow:
 90: 
 91: ```mermaid
 92: sequenceDiagram
 93:     participant C as Crew
 94:     participant MyAgent as Agent (Researcher)
 95:     participant LLM as Agent's Brain
 96:     participant SearchTool as Tool
 97: 
 98:     C->>MyAgent: Execute Task ("Find sunny cities in May")
 99:     MyAgent->>MyAgent: Consult profile (Role, Goal, Backstory)
100:     MyAgent->>LLM: Formulate plan & Ask: "Best way to find sunny cities?"
101:     LLM-->>MyAgent: Suggestion: "Search web for 'Europe weather May'"
102:     MyAgent->>SearchTool: Use Tool(query="Europe weather May sunny cities")
103:     SearchTool-->>MyAgent: Web search results (e.g., Lisbon, Seville, Malta)
104:     MyAgent->>LLM: Consolidate results & Ask: "Format these 3 cities nicely"
105:     LLM-->>MyAgent: Formatted list: "1. Lisbon..."
106:     MyAgent-->>C: Task Result ("Here are 3 sunny cities: Lisbon...")
107: 
108: ```
109: 
110: **Diving into the Code (`agent.py`)**
111: 
112: The core logic for the `Agent` resides in the `crewai/agent.py` file.
113: 
114: The `Agent` class itself inherits from `BaseAgent` (`crewai/agents/agent_builder/base_agent.py`) and primarily stores the configuration you provide:
115: 
116: ```python
117: # Simplified view from crewai/agent.py
118: from crewai.agents.agent_builder.base_agent import BaseAgent
119: # ... other imports
120: 
121: class Agent(BaseAgent):
122:     role: str = Field(description="Role of the agent")
123:     goal: str = Field(description="Objective of the agent")
124:     backstory: str = Field(description="Backstory of the agent")
125:     llm: Any = Field(default=None, description="LLM instance")
126:     tools: Optional[List[BaseTool]] = Field(default_factory=list)
127:     allow_delegation: bool = Field(default=False)
128:     verbose: bool = Field(default=False)
129:     # ... other fields like memory, max_iter, etc.
130: 
131:     def execute_task(
132:         self,
133:         task: Task,
134:         context: Optional[str] = None,
135:         tools: Optional[List[BaseTool]] = None,
136:     ) -> str:
137:         # ... (steps 1 & 2: Prepare task prompt with context, memory, knowledge) ...

151:             "tools": self._get_tool_descriptions(self.agent_executor.tools),
152:             # ... other inputs for the executor ...
153:         })["output"] # Extract the final string output
154: 
155:         return result
156: 
157:     def create_agent_executor(self, tools: Optional[List[BaseTool]] = None) -> None:
158:         # Sets up the internal CrewAgentExecutor which handles the actual
159:         # interaction loop with the LLM and tools.
160:         # It uses the agent's profile (role, goal, backstory) to build the main prompt.
161:         pass
162: 
163:     # ... other helper methods ...
164: ```
165: 
166: Key takeaways from the code:
167: 
168: *   The `Agent` class mainly holds the configuration (`role`, `goal`, `backstory`, `llm`, `tools`, etc.).
169: *   The `execute_task` method is called by the `Crew` when it's the agent's turn.
170: *   It prepares a detailed prompt for the underlying LLM, incorporating the task, context, the agent's profile, and available tools.
171: *   It uses an internal object called `agent_executor` (specifically `CrewAgentExecutor` from `crewai/agents/crew_agent_executor.py`) to manage the actual step-by-step thinking, tool use, and response generation loop with the LLM.
172: 
173: You don't need to understand the `agent_executor` in detail right now, just know that it's the engine that drives the agent's execution based on the profile and task you provide.
174: 
175: ## Conclusion
176: 
177: You've now met the core members of your AI team: the `Agent`s! You learned that each `Agent` is a specialized worker defined by its `role`, `goal`, and `backstory`. They use an [LLM](06_llm.md) as their brain and can be equipped with [Tools](04_tool.md) to perform specific actions.
178: 
179: We saw how to define an agent in code and got a glimpse into how they process information and execute the work assigned by the [Crew](01_crew.md).
180: 
181: But defining an `Agent` is only half the story. What specific work should they *do*? How do we describe the individual steps needed to achieve the `Crew`'s overall objective? That's where the next concept comes in: the [Task](03_task.md). Let's dive into defining the actual work!

  8: # Chapter 3: Task - Defining the Work
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1](01_crew.md), we met the `Crew` - our AI team manager. In [Chapter 2](02_agent.md), we met the `Agent`s - our specialized AI workers. Now, we need to tell these agents *exactly* what to do. How do we give them specific assignments?
 11: 
 12: That's where the `Task` comes in!
 13: 
 14: ## Why Do We Need Tasks?
 15: 
 16: Imagine our trip planning `Crew` again. We have a 'Travel Researcher' [Agent](02_agent.md) and an 'Activity Planner' [Agent](02_agent.md). Just having them isn't enough. We need to give them clear instructions:
 17: 
 18: *   Researcher: "Find some sunny cities in Europe for May."
 19: *   Planner: "Create a 3-day plan for the city the Researcher found."
 20: 
 21: These specific instructions are **`Task`s** in CrewAI. Instead of one vague goal, we break the project down into smaller, concrete steps.
 22: 
 23: **Problem Solved:** `Task` allows you to define individual, actionable assignments for your [Agent](02_agent.md)s. It turns a big goal into a manageable checklist.
 24: 
 25: ## What is a Task?
 26: 
 27: Think of a `Task` as a **work order** or a **specific assignment** given to an [Agent](02_agent.md). It clearly defines what needs to be done and what the expected result should look like.
 28: 
 29: Here are the key ingredients of a `Task`:
 30: 
 31: 1.  **`description`**: This is the most important part! It's a clear and detailed explanation of *what* the [Agent](02_agent.md) needs to accomplish. The more specific, the better.
 32: 2.  **`expected_output`**: This tells the [Agent](02_agent.md) what a successful result should look like. It sets a clear target. Examples: "A list of 3 cities with pros and cons.", "A bulleted list of activities.", "A paragraph summarizing the key findings."
 33: 3.  **`agent`**: This specifies *which* [Agent](02_agent.md) in your [Crew](01_crew.md) is responsible for completing this task. Each task is typically assigned to the agent best suited for it.
 34: 4.  **`context`** (Optional but Important!): Tasks don't usually happen in isolation. A task might need information or results from *previous* tasks. The `context` allows the output of one task to be automatically fed as input/background information to the next task in a sequence.
 35: 5.  **`tools`** (Optional): You can specify a list of [Tools](04_tool.md) that the [Agent](02_agent.md) is *allowed* to use specifically for *this* task. This can be useful to restrict or grant specific capabilities for certain assignments.
 36: 6.  **`async_execution`** (Optional, Advanced): You can set this to `True` if you want the task to potentially run at the same time as other asynchronous tasks. We'll stick to synchronous (one after another) for now.
 37: 7.  **`output_json` / `output_pydantic`** (Optional, Advanced): If you need the task's final output in a structured format like JSON, you can specify a model here.
 38: 8.  **`output_file`** (Optional, Advanced): You can have the task automatically save its output to a file.
 39: 
 40: A `Task` bundles the instructions (`description`, `expected_output`) and assigns them to the right worker (`agent`), potentially giving them background info (`context`) and specific equipment (`tools`).
 41: 
 42: ## Let's Define a Task!
 43: 
 44: Let's look again at the tasks we created for our trip planning [Crew](01_crew.md) in [Chapter 1](01_crew.md).
 45: 
 46: ```python
 47: # Import necessary classes
 48: from crewai import Task, Agent # Assuming Agent class is defined as in Chapter 2
 49: 
 50: # Assume 'researcher' and 'planner' agents are already defined
 51: # researcher = Agent(role='Travel Researcher', ...)
 52: # planner = Agent(role='Activity Planner', ...)
 53: 
 54: # Define Task 1 for the Researcher
 55: task1 = Task(
 56:   description=(
 57:       "Identify the top 3 European cities known for great sunny weather "
 58:       "around late May. Focus on cities with vibrant culture and good food."
 59:   ),
 60:   expected_output=(
 61:       "A numbered list of 3 cities, each with a brief (1-2 sentence) justification "
 62:       "mentioning weather, culture, and food highlights."
 63:   ),
 64:   agent=researcher # Assign this task to our researcher agent
 65: )
 66: 
 67: # Define Task 2 for the Planner
 68: task2 = Task(
 69:   description=(
 70:       "Using the list of cities provided by the researcher, select the best city "
 71:       "and create a detailed 3-day itinerary. Include morning, afternoon, and "
 72:       "evening activities, plus restaurant suggestions."
 73:   ),
 74:   expected_output=(
 75:       "A markdown formatted 3-day itinerary for the chosen city. "
 76:       "Include timings, activity descriptions, and 2-3 restaurant ideas."
 77:   ),
 78:   agent=planner # Assign this task to our planner agent
 79:   # context=[task1] # Optionally explicitly define context (often handled automatically)
 80: )
 81: 
 82: # (You would then add these tasks to a Crew)
 83: # print(task1)
 84: # print(task2)
 85: ```
 86: 
 87: **Explanation:**
 88: 
 89: *   `from crewai import Task`: We import the `Task` class.
 90: *   `description=...`: We write a clear instruction for the agent. Notice how `task1` specifies the criteria (sunny, May, culture, food). `task2` explicitly mentions using the output from the previous task.
 91: *   `expected_output=...`: We define what success looks like. `task1` asks for a numbered list with justifications. `task2` asks for a formatted itinerary. This helps the AI agent structure its response.
 92: *   `agent=researcher` / `agent=planner`: We link each task directly to the [Agent](02_agent.md) responsible for doing the work.
 93: *   `context=[task1]` (Commented Out): We *could* explicitly tell `task2` that it depends on `task1`. However, when using a `sequential` [Process](05_process.md) in the [Crew](01_crew.md), this dependency is usually handled automatically! The output of `task1` will be passed to `task2` as context.
 94: 
 95: Running this code creates `Task` objects, ready to be managed by a [Crew](01_crew.md).
 96: 
 97: ## Task Workflow and Context: Connecting the Dots
 98: 
 99: Tasks are rarely standalone. They often form a sequence, where the result of one task is needed for the next. This is where `context` comes in.
100: 
101: Imagine our `Crew` is set up with a `sequential` [Process](05_process.md) (like in Chapter 1):
102: 
103: 1.  The `Crew` runs `task1` using the `researcher` agent.
104: 2.  The `researcher` completes `task1` and produces an output (e.g., "1. Lisbon...", "2. Seville...", "3. Malta..."). This output is stored.
105: 3.  The `Crew` moves to `task2`. Because it's sequential, it automatically takes the output from `task1` and provides it as *context* to `task2`.
106: 4.  The `planner` agent receives `task2`'s description *and* the list of cities from `task1` as context.
107: 5.  The `planner` uses this context to complete `task2` (e.g., creates an itinerary for Lisbon).
108: 
109: This automatic passing of information makes building workflows much easier!
110: 
111: ```mermaid
112: graph LR
113:     A["Task 1: Find Cities (Agent: Researcher)"] -->|Output: Lisbon, Seville, Malta| B[Context for Task 2]
114:     B --> C["Task 2: Create Itinerary (Agent: Planner)"]
115:     C -->|Output: Lisbon Itinerary...| D[Final Result]
116: 
117:     style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
118:     style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
119:     style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
120:     style D fill:#cfc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
121: ```
122: 
123: While the `sequential` process often handles context automatically, you *can* explicitly define dependencies using the `context` parameter in the `Task` definition if you need more control, especially with more complex workflows.
124: 
125: ## How Does a Task Execute "Under the Hood"?
126: 
127: When the [Crew](01_crew.md)'s `kickoff()` method runs a task, here's a simplified view of what happens:
128: 
129: 1.  **Selection:** The [Crew](01_crew.md) (based on its [Process](05_process.md)) picks the next `Task` to execute.
130: 2.  **Agent Assignment:** It identifies the `agent` assigned to this `Task`.
131: 3.  **Context Gathering:** It collects the output from any prerequisite tasks (like the previous task in a sequential process) to form the `context`.
132: 4.  **Execution Call:** The [Crew](01_crew.md) tells the assigned `Agent` to execute the `Task`, passing the `description`, `expected_output`, available `tools` (if any specified for the task), and the gathered `context`.
133: 5.  **Agent Work:** The [Agent](02_agent.md) uses its configuration ([LLM](06_llm.md), backstory, etc.) and the provided information (task details, context, tools) to perform the work.
134: 6.  **Result Return:** The [Agent](02_agent.md) generates the result and returns it as a `TaskOutput` object.
135: 7.  **Output Storage:** The [Crew](01_crew.md) receives this `TaskOutput` and stores it, making it available as potential context for future tasks.
136: 
137: Let's visualize the interaction:
138: 
139: ```mermaid
140: sequenceDiagram
141:     participant C as Crew
142:     participant T1 as Task 1
143:     participant R_Agent as Researcher Agent

145:     participant P_Agent as Planner Agent
146: 
147:     C->>T1: Prepare to Execute
148:     Note right of T1: Task 1 selected
149:     C->>R_Agent: Execute Task(T1.description, T1.expected_output)

151:     R_Agent-->>C: Return TaskOutput (Cities List)
152:     C->>C: Store TaskOutput from T1
153: 
154:     C->>T2: Prepare to Execute
155:     Note right of T2: Task 2 selected
156:     Note right of C: Get Context (Output from T1)
157:     C->>P_Agent: Execute Task(T2.description, T2.expected_output, context=T1_Output)
158:     P_Agent->>P_Agent: Use LLM, Profile, Tools, Context...
159:     P_Agent-->>C: Return TaskOutput (Itinerary)
160:     C->>C: Store TaskOutput from T2
161: ```
162: 
163: **Diving into the Code (`task.py`)**
164: 
165: The `Task` class itself is defined in `crewai/task.py`. It's primarily a container for the information you provide:
166: 
167: ```python
168: # Simplified view from crewai/task.py
169: from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
170: from typing import List, Optional, Type, Any
171: # Import Agent and Tool placeholders for the example
172: from crewai import BaseAgent, BaseTool
173: 
174: class TaskOutput(BaseModel): # Simplified representation of the result
175:     description: str
176:     raw: str
177:     agent: str
178:     # ... other fields like pydantic, json_dict
179: 
180: class Task(BaseModel):
181:     # Core attributes
182:     description: str = Field(description="Description of the actual task.")
183:     expected_output: str = Field(description="Clear definition of expected output.")
184:     agent: Optional[BaseAgent] = Field(default=None, description="Agent responsible.")
185: 
186:     # Optional attributes
187:     context: Optional[List["Task"]] = Field(default=None, description="Context from other tasks.")
188:     tools: Optional[List[BaseTool]] = Field(default_factory=list, description="Task-specific tools.")
189:     async_execution: Optional[bool] = Field(default=False)
190:     output_json: Optional[Type[BaseModel]] = Field(default=None)
191:     output_pydantic: Optional[Type[BaseModel]] = Field(default=None)
192:     output_file: Optional[str] = Field(default=None)
193:     callback: Optional[Any] = Field(default=None) # Function to call after execution
194: 
195:     # Internal state
196:     output: Optional[TaskOutput] = Field(default=None, description="Task output after execution")
197: 
198:     def execute_sync(
199:         self,
200:         agent: Optional[BaseAgent] = None,
201:         context: Optional[str] = None,
202:         tools: Optional[List[BaseTool]] = None,
203:     ) -> TaskOutput:
204:         # 1. Identify the agent to use (passed or self.agent)
205:         agent_to_execute = agent or self.agent
206:         if not agent_to_execute:
207:             raise Exception("No agent assigned to task.")
208: 
209:         # 2. Prepare tools (task tools override agent tools if provided)
210:         execution_tools = tools or self.tools or agent_to_execute.tools
211: 
212:         # 3. Call the agent's execute_task method
213:         #    (The agent handles LLM calls, tool use, etc.)
214:         raw_result = agent_to_execute.execute_task(
215:             task=self, # Pass self (the task object)
216:             context=context,
217:             tools=execution_tools,
218:         )
219: 
220:         # 4. Format the output
221:         # (Handles JSON/Pydantic conversion if requested)
222:         pydantic_output, json_output = self._export_output(raw_result)
223: 
224:         # 5. Create and return TaskOutput object
225:         task_output = TaskOutput(
226:             description=self.description,
227:             raw=raw_result,
228:             pydantic=pydantic_output,
229:             json_dict=json_output,
230:             agent=agent_to_execute.role,
231:             # ... other fields
232:         )
233:         self.output = task_output # Store the output within the task object
234: 
235:         # 6. Execute callback if defined
236:         if self.callback:
237:             self.callback(task_output)
238: 
239:         # 7. Save to file if output_file is set
240:         if self.output_file:
241:             # ... logic to save file ...
242:             pass
243: 
244:         return task_output
245: 
246:     def prompt(self) -> str:
247:         # Combines description and expected output for the agent
248:         return f"{self.description}\n\nExpected Output:\n{self.expected_output}"
249: 
250:     # ... other methods like execute_async, _export_output, _save_file ...
251: ```
252: 
253: Key takeaways from the code:
254: 
255: *   The `Task` class holds the configuration (`description`, `expected_output`, `agent`, etc.).
256: *   The `execute_sync` (and `execute_async`) method orchestrates the execution *by calling the assigned agent's `execute_task` method*. The task itself doesn't contain the AI logic; it delegates that to the agent.
257: *   It takes the raw result from the agent and wraps it in a `TaskOutput` object, handling formatting (like JSON) and optional actions (callbacks, file saving).
258: *   The `prompt()` method shows how the core instructions are formatted before being potentially combined with context and tool descriptions by the agent.
259: 
260: ## Advanced Task Features (A Quick Peek)
261: 
262: While we focused on the basics, `Task` has more capabilities:
263: 
264: *   **Asynchronous Execution (`async_execution=True`):** Allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, potentially speeding up your Crew if tasks don't strictly depend on each other's immediate output.
265: *   **Structured Outputs (`output_json`, `output_pydantic`):** Force the agent to return data in a specific Pydantic model or JSON structure, making it easier to use the output programmatically.
266: *   **File Output (`output_file='path/to/output.txt'`):** Automatically save the task's result to a specified file.
267: *   **Conditional Tasks (`ConditionalTask`):** A special type of task (defined in `crewai.tasks.conditional_task`) that only runs if a specific condition (based on the previous task's output) is met. This allows for branching logic in your workflows.
268: 
269: ## Conclusion
270: 
271: You've now learned about the `Task` – the fundamental unit of work in CrewAI. A `Task` defines *what* needs to be done (`description`), what the result should look like (`expected_output`), and *who* should do it (`agent`). Tasks are the building blocks of your Crew's plan, and their outputs often flow as `context` to subsequent tasks, creating powerful workflows.
272: 
273: We've seen how to define Agents and give them Tasks. But what if an agent needs a specific ability, like searching the internet, calculating something, or reading a specific document? How do we give our agents superpowers? That's where [Tools](04_tool.md) come in! Let's explore them in the next chapter.
274: 
275: **Next:** [Chapter 4: Tool - Equipping Your Agents](04_tool.md)

  8: # Chapter 4: Tool - Equipping Your Agents
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 3: Task](03_task.md), we learned how to define specific assignments (`Task`s) for our AI `Agent`s. We told the 'Travel Researcher' agent to find sunny cities and the 'Activity Planner' agent to create an itinerary.
 11: 
 12: But wait... how does the 'Travel Researcher' actually *find* those cities? Can it browse the web? Can it look at weather data? By default, an [Agent](02_agent.md)'s "brain" ([LLM](06_llm.md)) is great at reasoning and generating text based on the information it already has, but it can't interact with the outside world on its own.
 13: 
 14: This is where `Tool`s come in! They are the **special equipment and abilities** we give our agents to make them more capable.
 15: 
 16: ## Why Do We Need Tools?
 17: 
 18: Imagine you hire a brilliant researcher. They can think, analyze, and write reports. But if their task is "Find the best coffee shop near me right now," they need specific tools: maybe a map application, a business directory, or a review website. Without these tools, they can only guess or rely on outdated knowledge.
 19: 
 20: Similarly, our AI [Agent](02_agent.md)s need `Tool`s to perform actions beyond simple text generation.
 21: 
 22: *   Want your agent to find current information? Give it a **web search tool**.
 23: *   Need it to perform calculations? Give it a **calculator tool**.
 24: *   Want it to read a specific document? Give it a **file reading tool**.
 25: *   Need it to ask another agent for help? Use the built-in **delegation tool** ([AgentTools](tools/agent_tools/agent_tools.py)).
 26: 
 27: **Problem Solved:** `Tool`s extend an [Agent](02_agent.md)'s capabilities beyond its built-in knowledge, allowing it to interact with external systems, perform specific computations, or access real-time information.
 28: 
 29: ## What is a Tool?
 30: 
 31: Think of a `Tool` as a **function or capability** that an [Agent](02_agent.md) can choose to use while working on a [Task](03_task.md). Each `Tool` has a few key parts:
 32: 
 33: 1.  **`name`**: A short, unique name for the tool (e.g., `web_search`, `calculator`).
 34: 2.  **`description`**: This is **very important**! It tells the [Agent](02_agent.md) *what the tool does* and *when it should be used*. The agent's [LLM](06_llm.md) reads this description to decide if the tool is appropriate for the current step of its task. A good description is crucial for the agent to use the tool correctly. Example: "Useful for searching the internet for current events or information."
 35: 3.  **`args_schema`** (Optional): Defines the inputs the tool needs to work. For example, a `web_search` tool would likely need a `query` argument (the search term). This is often defined using Pydantic models.
 36: 4.  **`_run` method**: This is the actual code that gets executed when the agent uses the tool. It takes the arguments defined in `args_schema` and performs the action (like calling a search API or performing a calculation).
 37: 
 38: Agents are given a list of `Tool`s they are allowed to use. When an agent is working on a task, its internal thought process might lead it to conclude that it needs a specific capability. It will then look through its available tools, read their descriptions, and if it finds a match, it will figure out the necessary arguments and execute the tool's `_run` method.
 39: 
 40: ## Equipping an Agent with a Tool
 41: 
 42: CrewAI integrates with many existing toolkits, like `crewai_tools` (install separately: `pip install 'crewai[tools]'`). Let's give our 'Travel Researcher' agent a web search tool. We'll use `SerperDevTool` as an example, which uses the Serper.dev API for Google Search results.
 43: 
 44: *(Note: Using tools like this often requires API keys. You'll need to sign up for Serper.dev and set the `SERPER_API_KEY` environment variable for this specific example to run.)*
 45: 
 46: ```python
 47: # Make sure you have crewai and crewai_tools installed
 48: # pip install crewai crewai_tools
 49: 
 50: import os
 51: from crewai import Agent
 52: from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
 53: 
 54: # Set up your API key (replace with your actual key or environment variable setup)
 55: # IMPORTANT: Do NOT hardcode keys in production code! Use environment variables.
 56: # os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_SERPER_API_KEY"
 57: 
 58: # 1. Instantiate the tool
 59: #    (It automatically gets a name and description)
 60: search_tool = SerperDevTool()
 61: 
 62: # 2. Define the agent and provide the tool in the 'tools' list
 63: researcher = Agent(
 64:   role='Expert Travel Researcher',
 65:   goal='Find the three most exciting and sunny European cities for a birthday trip in late May.',
 66:   backstory=(
 67:       "You are a world-class travel researcher with deep knowledge of "
 68:       "European destinations. You excel at finding hidden gems and understanding "
 69:       "weather patterns. Your recommendations are always insightful and tailored. "
 70:       "You MUST use the web search tool to find the most up-to-date information." # Added instruction
 71:   ),
 72:   verbose=True,
 73:   allow_delegation=False,
 74:   tools=[search_tool] # <-- Give the agent access to the tool!
 75:   # llm=your_llm # Assumes an LLM is configured (see Chapter 6)
 76: )
 77: 
 78: # (You would then create a Task and a Crew as shown in previous chapters)
 79: # task1 = Task(description="Find 3 sunny European cities for May...", agent=researcher, ...)
 80: # trip_crew = Crew(agents=[researcher], tasks=[task1], ...)
 81: # result = trip_crew.kickoff()
 82: # print(result)
 83: ```
 84: 
 85: **Explanation:**
 86: 
 87: 1.  We import `SerperDevTool` from `crewai_tools`.
 88: 2.  We create an instance of the tool: `search_tool = SerperDevTool()`. This object now holds the `name` ("Search"), `description` ("A tool that can be used to search the internet..."), and the `_run` logic to call the Serper API.
 89: 3.  When defining our `researcher` [Agent](02_agent.md), we pass a list containing `search_tool` to the `tools` parameter: `tools=[search_tool]`.
 90: 4.  We also updated the agent's `backstory` to explicitly encourage using the tool, which can sometimes help guide the agent.
 91: 
 92: **Expected Outcome (Conceptual):**
 93: 
 94: When this `researcher` agent runs a [Task](03_task.md) like "Find 3 sunny European cities for May...", because `verbose=True`, you would see its thought process. It might look something like this (simplified):
 95: 
 96: ```
 97: Thought: I need to find sunny European cities for May. The best way to get current information is to search the web. I have a 'Search' tool available. I should use it.
 98: Action: Search
 99: Action Input: {"query": "best sunny European cities May weather culture food"}
100: 
101: [... Agent waits for the tool to run ...]
102: 
103: Observation: [Search results mentioning Lisbon, Seville, Malta, Athens, etc. with details]
104: 
105: Thought: Okay, the search results suggest Lisbon, Seville, and Malta are good options based on sun, culture, and food. I will summarize these findings as requested.
106: Final Answer: Here are the top 3 sunny European cities for May... 1. Lisbon... 2. Seville... 3. Malta...
107: ```
108: 
109: The agent used the tool's `description` to know when to use it, formulated the necessary input (`query`), executed the tool, received the `Observation` (the tool's output), and then used that information to generate its `Final Answer`.
110: 
111: ## How Tools Work "Under the Hood"
112: 
113: When an [Agent](02_agent.md) equipped with tools runs a [Task](03_task.md), a fascinating interaction happens between the Agent, its [LLM](06_llm.md) brain, and the Tools.
114: 
115: 1.  **Task Received:** The Agent gets the task description and any context.
116: 2.  **Initial Thought:** The Agent's [LLM](06_llm.md) thinks about the task and its profile (`role`, `goal`, `backstory`). It formulates an initial plan.
117: 3.  **Need for Capability:** The LLM might realize it needs information it doesn't have (e.g., "What's the weather like *right now*?") or needs to perform an action (e.g., "Calculate 5 factorial").
118: 4.  **Tool Selection:** The Agent provides its [LLM](06_llm.md) with the list of available `Tool`s, including their `name`s and crucially, their `description`s. The LLM checks if any tool description matches the capability it needs.
119: 5.  **Tool Invocation Decision:** If the LLM finds a suitable tool (e.g., it needs to search, and finds the `Search` tool whose description says "Useful for searching the internet"), it decides to use it. It outputs a special message indicating the tool name and the arguments (based on the tool's `args_schema`).
120: 6.  **Tool Execution:** The CrewAI framework intercepts this special message. It finds the corresponding `Tool` object and calls its `run()` method, passing the arguments the LLM provided.
121: 7.  **Action Performed:** The tool's `_run()` method executes its code (e.g., calls an external API, runs a calculation).
122: 8.  **Result Returned:** The tool's `_run()` method returns its result (e.g., the text of the search results, the calculated number).
123: 9.  **Observation Provided:** The CrewAI framework takes the tool's result and feeds it back to the Agent's [LLM](06_llm.md) as an "Observation".
124: 10. **Continued Thought:** The LLM now has new information from the tool. It incorporates this observation into its thinking and continues working on the task, potentially deciding to use another tool or generate the final answer.
125: 
126: Let's visualize this flow for our researcher using the search tool:
127: 
128: ```mermaid
129: sequenceDiagram
130:     participant A as Agent
131:     participant LLM as Agent's Brain
132:     participant ST as Search Tool
133: 
134:     A->>LLM: Task: "Find sunny cities..." Plan?
135:     LLM-->>A: Plan: Need current info. Search web for "sunny European cities May".
136:     A->>A: Check tools: Found 'Search' tool (description matches).
137:     A->>LLM: Format request for 'Search' tool. Query?
138:     LLM-->>A: Output: Use Tool 'Search' with args {"query": "sunny European cities May"}
139:     A->>ST: run(query="sunny European cities May")
140:     Note right of ST: ST._run() calls Serper API...
141:     ST-->>A: Return results: "Lisbon (Sunny...), Seville (Hot...), Malta (Warm...)"
142:     A->>LLM: Observation: Got results "Lisbon...", "Seville...", "Malta..."
143:     LLM-->>A: Thought: Use these results to formulate the final list.
144:     LLM-->>A: Final Answer: "Based on recent web search, the top cities are..."
145: ```
146: 
147: **Diving into the Code (`tools/base_tool.py`)**
148: 
149: The foundation for all tools is the `BaseTool` class (found in `crewai/tools/base_tool.py`). When you use a pre-built tool or create your own, it typically inherits from this class.
150: 
151: ```python
152: # Simplified view from crewai/tools/base_tool.py
153: from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
154: from typing import Type, Optional, Any
155: from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
156: 
157: class BaseTool(BaseModel, ABC):
158:     # Configuration for the tool
159:     name: str = Field(description="The unique name of the tool.")
160:     description: str = Field(description="What the tool does, how/when to use it.")
161:     args_schema: Optional[Type[BaseModel]] = Field(
162:         default=None, description="Pydantic schema for the tool's arguments."
163:     )
164:     # ... other options like caching ...
165: 
166:     # This method contains the actual logic
167:     @abstractmethod
168:     def _run(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
169:         """The core implementation of the tool's action."""
170:         pass
171: 
172:     # This method is called by the agent execution framework
173:     def run(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
174:         """Executes the tool's core logic."""
175:         # Could add logging, error handling, caching calls here
176:         print(f"----- Executing Tool: {self.name} -----") # Example logging
177:         result = self._run(*args, **kwargs)
178:         print(f"----- Tool {self.name} Finished -----")
179:         return result
180: 
181:     # Helper method to generate a structured description for the LLM
182:     def _generate_description(self):
183:         # Creates a detailed description including name, args, and description
184:         # This is what the LLM sees to decide if it should use the tool
185:         pass
186: 
187:     # ... other helper methods ...
188: 
189: # You can create a simple tool using the 'Tool' class directly
190: # or inherit from BaseTool for more complex logic.
191: from typing import Type
192: 
193: class SimpleTool(BaseTool):
194:     name: str = "MySimpleTool"
195:     description: str = "A very simple example tool."
196:     # No args_schema needed if it takes no arguments
197: 
198:     def _run(self) -> str:
199:         return "This simple tool was executed successfully!"
200: 
201: ```
202: 
203: Key takeaways:
204: 
205: *   `BaseTool` requires `name` and `description`.
206: *   `args_schema` defines the expected input structure (using Pydantic).
207: *   The actual logic lives inside the `_run` method.
208: *   The `run` method is the entry point called by the framework.
209: *   The framework (`crewai/tools/tool_usage.py` and `crewai/agents/executor.py`) handles the complex part: presenting tools to the LLM, parsing the LLM's decision to use a tool, calling `tool.run()`, and feeding the result back.
210: 
211: A special mention goes to `AgentTools` (`crewai/tools/agent_tools/agent_tools.py`), which provides tools like `Delegate work to coworker` and `Ask question to coworker`, enabling agents within a [Crew](01_crew.md) to collaborate.
212: 
213: ## Creating Your Own Simple Tool (Optional)
214: 
215: While CrewAI offers many pre-built tools, sometimes you need a custom one. Let's create a *very* basic calculator.
216: 
217: ```python
218: from crewai.tools import BaseTool
219: from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
220: from typing import Type
221: import math # Using math module for safety
222: 
223: # 1. Define the input schema using Pydantic
224: class CalculatorInput(BaseModel):
225:     expression: str = Field(description="The mathematical expression to evaluate (e.g., '2 + 2 * 4').")
226: 
227: # 2. Create the Tool class, inheriting from BaseTool
228: class CalculatorTool(BaseTool):
229:     name: str = "Calculator"
230:     description: str = "Useful for evaluating simple mathematical expressions involving numbers, +, -, *, /, and parentheses."
231:     args_schema: Type[BaseModel] = CalculatorInput # Link the input schema
232: 
233:     def _run(self, expression: str) -> str:
234:         """Evaluates the mathematical expression."""
235:         allowed_chars = "0123456789+-*/(). "
236:         if not all(c in allowed_chars for c in expression):
237:              return "Error: Expression contains invalid characters."
238: 
239:         try:
240:             # VERY IMPORTANT: eval() is dangerous with arbitrary user input.
241:             # In a real application, use a safer parsing library like 'numexpr' or build your own parser.
242:             # This is a simplified example ONLY.
243:             result = eval(expression, {"__builtins__": None}, {"math": math}) # Safer eval
244:             return f"The result of '{expression}' is {result}"
245:         except Exception as e:
246:             return f"Error evaluating expression '{expression}': {e}"
247: 
248: # 3. Instantiate and use it in an agent
249: calculator = CalculatorTool()
250: 
251: math_agent = Agent(
252:     role='Math Whiz',
253:     goal='Calculate the results of mathematical expressions accurately.',
254:     backstory='You are an expert mathematician agent.',
255:     tools=[calculator], # Give the agent the calculator
256:     verbose=True
257: )
258: 
259: # Example Task for this agent:
260: # math_task = Task(description="What is the result of (5 + 3) * 6 / 2?", agent=math_agent)
261: ```
262: 
263: **Explanation:**
264: 
265: 1.  We define `CalculatorInput` using Pydantic to specify that the tool needs an `expression` string. The `description` here helps the LLM understand what kind of string to provide.
266: 2.  We create `CalculatorTool` inheriting from `BaseTool`. We set `name`, `description`, and link `args_schema` to our `CalculatorInput`.
267: 3.  The `_run` method takes the `expression` string. We added a basic safety check and used a slightly safer version of `eval`. **Again, `eval` is generally unsafe; prefer dedicated math parsing libraries in production.** It returns the result as a string.
268: 4.  We can now instantiate `CalculatorTool()` and add it to an agent's `tools` list.
269: 
270: ## Conclusion
271: 
272: You've learned about `Tool`s – the essential equipment that gives your AI [Agent](02_agent.md)s superpowers! Tools allow agents to perform actions like searching the web, doing calculations, or interacting with other systems, making them vastly more useful than agents that can only generate text. We saw how to equip an agent with pre-built tools and even how to create a simple custom tool by defining its `name`, `description`, `args_schema`, and `_run` method. The `description` is key for the agent to know when and how to use its tools effectively.
273: 
274: Now that we have Agents equipped with Tools and assigned Tasks, how does the whole [Crew](01_crew.md) actually coordinate the work? Do agents work one after another? Is there a manager? That's determined by the `Process`. Let's explore that next!

  8: # Chapter 5: Process - Orchestrating the Workflow
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 4: Tool](04_tool.md), we learned how to give our [Agent](02_agent.md)s special abilities using `Tool`s, like searching the web. Now we have specialized agents, defined tasks, and equipped agents. But how do they actually *work together*? Does Agent 1 finish its work before Agent 2 starts? Or is there a manager overseeing everything?
 11: 
 12: This coordination is handled by the **`Process`**.
 13: 
 14: ## Why Do We Need a Process?
 15: 
 16: Think back to our trip planning [Crew](01_crew.md). We have a 'Travel Researcher' agent and an 'Activity Planner' agent.
 17: 
 18: *   **Scenario 1:** Maybe the Researcher needs to find the city *first*, and *then* the Planner creates the itinerary for that specific city. The work happens in a specific order.
 19: *   **Scenario 2:** Maybe we have a more complex project with many agents (Researcher, Planner, Booker, Budgeter). Perhaps we want a 'Project Manager' agent to receive the main goal, decide which agent needs to do what first, review their work, and then assign the next step.
 20: 
 21: The way the agents collaborate and the order in which [Task](03_task.md)s are executed is crucial for success. A well-defined `Process` ensures work flows smoothly and efficiently.
 22: 
 23: **Problem Solved:** `Process` defines the strategy or workflow the [Crew](01_crew.md) uses to execute its [Task](03_task.md)s. It dictates how [Agent](02_agent.md)s collaborate and how information moves between them.
 24: 
 25: ## What is a Process?
 26: 
 27: Think of the `Process` as the **project management style** for your [Crew](01_crew.md). It determines the overall flow of work. CrewAI primarily supports two types of processes:
 28: 
 29: 1.  **`Process.sequential`**:
 30:     *   **Analogy:** Like following a recipe or a checklist.
 31:     *   **How it works:** Tasks are executed one after another, in the exact order you list them in the `Crew` definition. The output of the first task automatically becomes available as context for the second task, the output of the second for the third, and so on.
 32:     *   **Best for:** Simple, linear workflows where each step clearly follows the previous one.
 33: 
 34: 2.  **`Process.hierarchical`**:
 35:     *   **Analogy:** Like a traditional company structure with a manager.
 36:     *   **How it works:** You designate a "manager" [Agent](02_agent.md) (usually by providing a specific `manager_llm` or a custom `manager_agent` to the `Crew`). This manager receives the overall goal and the list of tasks. It then analyzes the tasks and decides which *worker* agent should perform which task, potentially breaking them down or reordering them. The manager delegates work, reviews results, and coordinates the team until the goal is achieved.
 37:     *   **Best for:** More complex projects where task order might change, delegation is needed, or a central coordinator can optimize the workflow.
 38: 
 39: Choosing the right `Process` is key to structuring how your agents interact.
 40: 
 41: ## How to Use Process
 42: 
 43: You define the process when you create your `Crew`, using the `process` parameter.
 44: 
 45: ### Sequential Process
 46: 
 47: This is the default and simplest process. We already used it in [Chapter 1](01_crew.md)!
 48: 
 49: ```python
 50: # Assuming 'researcher' and 'planner' agents are defined (from Chapter 2)
 51: # Assuming 'task1' (find cities) and 'task2' (create itinerary) are defined (from Chapter 3)
 52: # task1 assigned to researcher, task2 assigned to planner
 53: 
 54: from crewai import Crew, Process
 55: 
 56: # Define the crew with a sequential process
 57: trip_crew = Crew(
 58:   agents=[researcher, planner],
 59:   tasks=[task1, task2],
 60:   process=Process.sequential # Explicitly setting the sequential process
 61:   # verbose=2 # Optional verbosity
 62: )
 63: 
 64: # Start the work
 65: # result = trip_crew.kickoff()
 66: # print(result)
 67: ```
 68: 
 69: **Explanation:**
 70: 
 71: *   We import `Crew` and `Process`.
 72: *   When creating the `trip_crew`, we pass our list of `agents` and `tasks`.
 73: *   We set `process=Process.sequential`.
 74: *   When `kickoff()` is called:
 75:     1.  `task1` (Find Cities) is executed by the `researcher`.
 76:     2.  The output of `task1` (the list of cities) is automatically passed as context.
 77:     3.  `task2` (Create Itinerary) is executed by the `planner`, using the cities list from `task1`.
 78:     4.  The final output of `task2` is returned.
 79: 
 80: It's simple and predictable: Task 1 -> Task 2 -> Done.
 81: 
 82: ### Hierarchical Process
 83: 
 84: For this process, the `Crew` needs a manager. You usually specify the language model the manager should use (`manager_llm`). The manager agent is created internally by CrewAI using this LLM.
 85: 
 86: ```python
 87: # Assuming 'researcher' and 'planner' agents are defined
 88: # Assuming 'task1' and 'task2' are defined (WITHOUT necessarily assigning agents initially)
 89: # You need an LLM configured (e.g., from OpenAI, Ollama - see Chapter 6)
 90: # from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI # Example LLM
 91: 
 92: from crewai import Crew, Process, Task
 93: 
 94: # Example tasks (agent assignment might be handled by the manager)
 95: task1 = Task(description='Find top 3 European cities for a sunny May birthday trip.', expected_output='List of 3 cities with justifications.')
 96: task2 = Task(description='Create a 3-day itinerary for the best city found.', expected_output='Detailed 3-day plan.')
 97: 
 98: # Define the crew with a hierarchical process and a manager LLM
 99: hierarchical_crew = Crew(
100:   agents=[researcher, planner], # The worker agents
101:   tasks=[task1, task2], # The tasks to be managed
102:   process=Process.hierarchical, # Set the process to hierarchical
103:   manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4") # Specify the LLM for the manager agent
104:   # You could also provide a pre-configured manager_agent instance instead of manager_llm
105: )
106: 
107: # Start the work
108: # result = hierarchical_crew.kickoff()
109: # print(result)
110: ```
111: 
112: **Explanation:**
113: 
114: *   We set `process=Process.hierarchical`.
115: *   We provide a list of worker `agents` (`researcher`, `planner`).
116: *   We provide the `tasks` that need to be accomplished. Note that for the hierarchical process, you *might* not need to assign agents directly to tasks, as the manager can decide who is best suited. However, assigning them can still provide hints to the manager.
117: *   Crucially, we provide `manager_llm`. CrewAI will use this LLM to create an internal 'Manager Agent'. This agent's implicit goal is to orchestrate the `agents` to complete the `tasks`.
118: *   When `kickoff()` is called:
119:     1.  The internal Manager Agent analyzes `task1` and `task2` and the available agents (`researcher`, `planner`).
120:     2.  It decides which agent should do `task1` (likely the `researcher`). It delegates the task using internal tools (like `AgentTools`).
121:     3.  It receives the result from the `researcher`.
122:     4.  It analyzes the result and decides the next step – likely delegating `task2` to the `planner`, providing the context from `task1`.
123:     5.  It receives the result from the `planner`.
124:     6.  Once all tasks are deemed complete by the manager, it compiles and returns the final result.
125: 
126: This process is more dynamic, allowing the manager to adapt the workflow.
127: 
128: ## How Process Works "Under the Hood"
129: 
130: When you call `crew.kickoff()`, the first thing the `Crew` does is check its `process` attribute to determine the execution strategy.
131: 
132: 1.  **Input & Setup:** `kickoff()` prepares the agents and tasks, interpolating any initial inputs.
133: 2.  **Process Check:** It looks at `crew.process`.
134: 3.  **Execution Path:**
135:     *   If `Process.sequential`, it calls an internal method like `_run_sequential_process()`.
136:     *   If `Process.hierarchical`, it first ensures a manager agent exists (creating one if `manager_llm` was provided) and then calls a method like `_run_hierarchical_process()`.
137: 4.  **Task Loop (Sequential):** `_run_sequential_process()` iterates through the `tasks` list in order. For each task, it finds the assigned agent, gathers context from the *previous* task's output, and asks the agent to execute the task.
138: 5.  **Managed Execution (Hierarchical):** `_run_hierarchical_process()` delegates control to the manager agent. The manager agent, using its LLM and specialized delegation tools (like `AgentTools`), decides which task to tackle next and which worker agent to assign it to. It manages the flow until all tasks are completed.
139: 6.  **Output:** The final result (usually the output of the last task) is packaged and returned.

184: ### Diving into the Code (`crew.py`)

280: 
281: Key takeaways from the code:
282: 
283: *   The `Crew` stores the `process` type (`sequential` or `hierarchical`).
284: *   A validation (`check_manager_llm`) ensures a manager (`manager_llm` or `manager_agent`) is provided if `process` is `hierarchical`.
285: *   The `kickoff` method explicitly checks `self.process` to decide which internal execution method (`_run_sequential_process` or `_run_hierarchical_process`) to call.
286: *   `_run_sequential_process` iterates through tasks in order.
287: *   `_run_hierarchical_process` relies on the `manager_agent` (created by `_create_manager_agent` if needed) to manage the task execution flow, often using delegation tools.
288: 
289: ## Conclusion
290: 
291: You've now learned about the `Process` - the crucial setting that defines *how* your [Crew](01_crew.md) collaborates.
292: 
293: *   **`Sequential`** is like a checklist: tasks run one by one, in order, with outputs flowing directly to the next task. Simple and predictable.
294: *   **`Hierarchical`** is like having a manager: a dedicated manager [Agent](02_agent.md) coordinates the worker agents, deciding who does what and when. More flexible for complex workflows.
295: 
296: Choosing the right process helps structure your agent interactions effectively.
297: 
298: So far, we've built the team ([Agent](02_agent.md)), defined the work ([Task](03_task.md)), given them abilities ([Tool](04_tool.md)), and decided on the workflow ([Process](05_process.md)). But what powers the "thinking" part of each agent? What is the "brain" that understands roles, goals, backstories, and uses tools? That's the Large Language Model, or [LLM](06_llm.md). Let's dive into that next!

  8: # Chapter 6: LLM - The Agent's Brain
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](05_process.md), we explored the `Process` - how the `Crew` organizes the workflow for its `Agent`s, deciding whether they work sequentially or are managed hierarchically. We now have specialized agents ([Agent](02_agent.md)), defined work ([Task](03_task.md)), useful abilities ([Tool](04_tool.md)), and a workflow strategy ([Process](05_process.md)).
 11: 
 12: But what actually does the *thinking* inside an agent? When we give the 'Travel Researcher' agent the task "Find sunny European cities," what part of the agent understands this request, decides to use the search tool, interprets the results, and writes the final list?
 13: 
 14: This core thinking component is the **Large Language Model**, or **LLM**.
 15: 
 16: ## Why Do Agents Need an LLM?
 17: 
 18: Imagine our 'Travel Researcher' agent again. It has a `role`, `goal`, and `backstory`. It has a `Task` to complete and maybe a `Tool` to search the web. But it needs something to:
 19: 
 20: 1.  **Understand:** Read the task description, its own role/goal, and any context from previous tasks.
 21: 2.  **Reason:** Figure out a plan. "Okay, I need sunny cities. My description says I'm an expert. The task asks for 3. I should use the search tool to get current info."
 22: 3.  **Act:** Decide *when* to use a tool and *what* input to give it (e.g., formulate the search query).
 23: 4.  **Generate:** Take the information (search results, its own knowledge) and write the final output in the expected format.
 24: 
 25: The LLM is the engine that performs all these cognitive actions. It's the "brain" that drives the agent's behavior based on the instructions and tools provided.
 26: 
 27: **Problem Solved:** The LLM provides the core intelligence for each `Agent`. It processes language, makes decisions (like which tool to use or what text to generate), and ultimately enables the agent to perform its assigned `Task` based on its defined profile.
 28: 
 29: ## What is an LLM in CrewAI?
 30: 
 31: Think of an LLM as a highly advanced, versatile AI assistant you can interact with using text. Models like OpenAI's GPT-4, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, or open-source models run locally via tools like Ollama are all examples of LLMs. They are trained on vast amounts of text data and can understand instructions, answer questions, write text, summarize information, and even make logical deductions.
 32: 
 33: In CrewAI, the `LLM` concept is an **abstraction**. CrewAI itself doesn't *include* these massive language models. Instead, it provides a standardized way to **connect to and interact with** various LLMs, whether they are hosted by companies like OpenAI or run on your own computer.
 34: 
 35: **How CrewAI Handles LLMs:**
 36: 
 37: *   **`litellm` Integration:** CrewAI uses a fantastic library called `litellm` under the hood. `litellm` acts like a universal translator, allowing CrewAI to talk to over 100 different LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Ollama, Hugging Face, etc.) using a consistent interface. This means you can easily switch the "brain" of your agents without rewriting large parts of your code.
 38: *   **Standard Interface:** The CrewAI `LLM` abstraction (often represented by helper classes or configuration settings) simplifies how you specify which model to use and how it should behave. It handles common parameters like:
 39:     *   `model`: The specific name of the LLM you want to use (e.g., `"gpt-4o"`, `"ollama/llama3"`, `"gemini-pro"`).
 40:     *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness (creativity) of the output. Lower values (e.g., 0.1) make the output more deterministic and focused, while higher values (e.g., 0.8) make it more creative but potentially less factual.
 41:     *   `max_tokens`: The maximum number of words (tokens) the LLM should generate in its response.
 42: *   **API Management:** It manages the technical details of sending requests to the chosen LLM provider and receiving the responses.
 43: 
 44: Essentially, CrewAI lets you plug in the LLM brain of your choice for your agents.
 45: 
 46: ## Configuring an LLM for Your Crew
 47: 
 48: You need to tell CrewAI which LLM(s) your agents should use. There are several ways to do this, ranging from letting CrewAI detect settings automatically to explicitly configuring specific models.
 49: 
 50: **1. Automatic Detection (Environment Variables)**
 51: 
 52: Often the easiest way for common models like OpenAI's is to set environment variables. CrewAI (via `litellm`) can pick these up automatically.
 53: 
 54: If you set these in your system or a `.env` file:
 55: 
 56: ```bash
 57: # Example .env file
 58: OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your_openai_api_key_here"
 59: # Optional: Specify the model, otherwise it uses a default like gpt-4o
 60: OPENAI_MODEL_NAME="gpt-4o"
 61: ```
 62: 
 63: Then, often you don't need to specify the LLM explicitly in your code:
 64: 
 65: ```python
 66: # agent.py (simplified)
 67: from crewai import Agent
 68: 
 69: # If OPENAI_API_KEY and OPENAI_MODEL_NAME are set in the environment,
 70: # CrewAI might automatically configure an OpenAI LLM for this agent.
 71: researcher = Agent(
 72:     role='Travel Researcher',
 73:     goal='Find interesting cities in Europe',
 74:     backstory='Expert researcher.',
 75:     # No 'llm=' parameter needed here if env vars are set
 76: )
 77: ```
 78: 
 79: **2. Explicit Configuration (Recommended for Clarity)**
 80: 
 81: It's usually better to be explicit about which LLM you want to use. CrewAI integrates well with LangChain's LLM wrappers, which are commonly used.
 82: 
 83: **Example: Using OpenAI (GPT-4o)**
 84: 
 85: ```python
 86: # Make sure you have langchain_openai installed: pip install langchain-openai
 87: import os
 88: from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
 89: from crewai import Agent
 90: 
 91: # Set the API key (best practice: use environment variables)
 92: # os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-your_key_here"
 93: 
 94: # Instantiate the OpenAI LLM wrapper
 95: openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0.7)
 96: 
 97: # Pass the configured LLM to the Agent
 98: researcher = Agent(
 99:     role='Travel Researcher',
100:     goal='Find interesting cities in Europe',
101:     backstory='Expert researcher.',
102:     llm=openai_llm # Explicitly assign the LLM
103: )
104: 
105: # You can also assign a default LLM to the Crew
106: # from crewai import Crew
107: # trip_crew = Crew(
108: #   agents=[researcher],
109: #   tasks=[...],
110: #   # Manager LLM for hierarchical process
111: #   manager_llm=openai_llm
112: #   # A function_calling_llm can also be set for tool use reasoning
113: #   # function_calling_llm=openai_llm
114: # )
115: ```
116: 
117: **Explanation:**
118: 
119: *   We import `ChatOpenAI` from `langchain_openai`.
120: *   We create an instance, specifying the `model` name and optionally other parameters like `temperature`.
121: *   We pass this `openai_llm` object to the `llm` parameter when creating the `Agent`. This agent will now use GPT-4o for its thinking.
122: *   You can also assign LLMs at the `Crew` level, especially the `manager_llm` for hierarchical processes or a default `function_calling_llm` which helps agents decide *which* tool to use.
123: 
124: **Example: Using a Local Model via Ollama (Llama 3)**
125: 
126: If you have Ollama running locally with a model like Llama 3 pulled (`ollama pull llama3`):
127: 
128: ```python
129: # Make sure you have langchain_community installed: pip install langchain-community
130: from langchain_community.llms import Ollama
131: from crewai import Agent
132: 
133: # Instantiate the Ollama LLM wrapper
134: # Make sure Ollama server is running!
135: ollama_llm = Ollama(model="llama3", base_url="http://localhost:11434")
136: # temperature, etc. can also be set if supported by the model/wrapper
137: 
138: # Pass the configured LLM to the Agent
139: local_researcher = Agent(
140:     role='Travel Researcher',
141:     goal='Find interesting cities in Europe',
142:     backstory='Expert researcher.',
143:     llm=ollama_llm # Use the local Llama 3 model
144: )
145: ```
146: 
147: **Explanation:**
148: 
149: *   We import `Ollama` from `langchain_community.llms`.
150: *   We create an instance, specifying the `model` name ("llama3" in this case, assuming it's available in your Ollama setup) and the `base_url` where your Ollama server is running.
151: *   We pass `ollama_llm` to the `Agent`. Now, this agent's "brain" runs entirely on your local machine!
152: 
153: **CrewAI's `LLM` Class (Advanced/Direct `litellm` Usage)**
154: 
155: CrewAI also provides its own `LLM` class (`from crewai import LLM`) which allows more direct configuration using `litellm` parameters. This is less common for beginners than using the LangChain wrappers shown above, but offers fine-grained control.
156: 
157: **Passing LLMs to the Crew**
158: 
159: Besides assigning an LLM to each agent individually, you can set defaults or specific roles at the `Crew` level:
160: 
161: ```python
162: from crewai import Crew, Process
163: from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
164: 
165: # Assume agents 'researcher', 'planner' and tasks 'task1', 'task2' are defined
166: 
167: openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
168: fast_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo") # Maybe a faster/cheaper model
169: 
170: trip_crew = Crew(
171:     agents=[researcher, planner], # Agents might have their own LLMs assigned too
172:     tasks=[task1, task2],
173:     process=Process.hierarchical,
174:     # The Manager agent will use gpt-4o
175:     manager_llm=openai_llm,
176:     # Use gpt-3.5-turbo specifically for deciding which tool to use (can save costs)
177:     function_calling_llm=fast_llm
178: )
179: ```
180: 
181: *   `manager_llm`: Specifies the brain for the manager agent in a hierarchical process.
182: *   `function_calling_llm`: Specifies the LLM used by agents primarily to decide *which tool to call* and *with what arguments*. This can sometimes be a faster/cheaper model than the one used for generating the final detailed response. If not set, agents typically use their main `llm`.
183: 
184: If an agent doesn't have an `llm` explicitly assigned, it might inherit the `function_calling_llm` or default to environment settings. It's usually clearest to assign LLMs explicitly where needed.
185: 
186: ## How LLM Interaction Works Internally
187: 
188: When an [Agent](02_agent.md) needs to think (e.g., execute a [Task](03_task.md)), the process looks like this:
189: 
190: 1.  **Prompt Assembly:** The `Agent` gathers all relevant information: its `role`, `goal`, `backstory`, the `Task` description, `expected_output`, any `context` from previous tasks, and the descriptions of its available `Tool`s. It assembles this into a detailed prompt.
191: 2.  **LLM Object Call:** The `Agent` passes this prompt to its configured `LLM` object (e.g., the `ChatOpenAI` instance or the `Ollama` instance we created).
192: 3.  **`litellm` Invocation:** The CrewAI/LangChain `LLM` object uses `litellm`'s `completion` function, passing the assembled prompt (formatted as messages), the target `model` name, and other parameters (`temperature`, `max_tokens`, `tools`, etc.).
193: 4.  **API Request:** `litellm` handles the specifics of communicating with the target LLM's API (e.g., sending a request to OpenAI's API endpoint or the local Ollama server).
194: 5.  **LLM Processing:** The actual LLM (GPT-4, Llama 3, etc.) processes the request.
195: 6.  **API Response:** The LLM provider sends back the response (which could be generated text or a decision to use a specific tool with certain arguments).
196: 7.  **`litellm` Response Handling:** `litellm` receives the API response and standardizes it.
197: 8.  **LLM Object Response:** The `LLM` object receives the standardized response from `litellm`.
198: 9.  **Result to Agent:** The `LLM` object returns the result (text or tool call information) back to the `Agent`.
199: 10. **Agent Action:** The `Agent` then either uses the generated text as its output or, if the LLM decided to use a tool, it executes the specified tool.
200: 
201: Let's visualize this:

205:     participant Agent
206:     participant LLM_Object as LLM Object (e.g., ChatOpenAI)
207:     participant LiteLLM
208:     participant ProviderAPI as Actual LLM API (e.g., OpenAI)
209: 
210:     Agent->>Agent: Assemble Prompt (Role, Goal, Task, Tools...)
211:     Agent->>LLM_Object: call(prompt, tools_schema)
212:     LLM_Object->>LiteLLM: litellm.completion(model, messages, ...)
213:     LiteLLM->>ProviderAPI: Send API Request
214:     ProviderAPI-->>LiteLLM: Receive API Response (text or tool_call)
215:     LiteLLM-->>LLM_Object: Standardized Response
216:     LLM_Object-->>Agent: Result (text or tool_call)
217:     Agent->>Agent: Process Result (Output text or Execute tool)
218: ```
219: 
220: **Diving into the Code (`llm.py`, `utilities/llm_utils.py`)**
221: 
222: The primary logic resides in `crewai/llm.py` and the helper `crewai/utilities/llm_utils.py`.
223: 
224: *   **`crewai/utilities/llm_utils.py`:** The `create_llm` function is key. It handles the logic of figuring out which LLM to instantiate based on environment variables, direct `LLM` object input, or string names. It tries to create an `LLM` instance.
225: *   **`crewai/llm.py`:**
226:     *   The `LLM` class itself holds the configuration (`model`, `temperature`, etc.).
227:     *   The `call` method is the main entry point. It takes the `messages` (the prompt) and optional `tools`.
228:     *   It calls `_prepare_completion_params` to format the request parameters based on the LLM's requirements and the provided configuration.
229:     *   Crucially, it then calls `litellm.completion(**params)`. This is where the magic happens – `litellm` takes over communication with the actual LLM API.
230:     *   It handles the response from `litellm`, checking for text content or tool calls (`_handle_non_streaming_response` or `_handle_streaming_response`).
231:     *   It uses helper methods like `_format_messages_for_provider` to deal with quirks of different LLMs (like Anthropic needing a 'user' message first).

321: This simplified view shows how the `LLM` class acts as a wrapper around `litellm`, preparing requests and processing responses, shielding the rest of CrewAI from the complexities of different LLM APIs.
322: 
323: ## Conclusion
324: 
325: You've learned about the **LLM**, the essential "brain" powering your CrewAI [Agent](02_agent.md)s. It's the component that understands language, reasons about tasks, decides on actions (like using [Tool](04_tool.md)s), and generates text.
326: 
327: We saw that CrewAI uses the `litellm` library to provide a flexible way to connect to a wide variety of LLM providers (like OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, or local models via Ollama). You can configure which LLM your agents or crew use, either implicitly through environment variables or explicitly by passing configured LLM objects (often using LangChain wrappers) during `Agent` or `Crew` creation.
328: 
329: This abstraction makes CrewAI powerful, allowing you to experiment with different models to find the best fit for your specific needs and budget.
330: 
331: But sometimes, agents need to remember things from past interactions or previous tasks within the same run. How does CrewAI handle short-term and potentially long-term memory? Let's explore that in the next chapter!

  8: # Chapter 7: Memory - Giving Your Crew Recall
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](06_llm.md), we looked at the Large Language Model ([LLM](06_llm.md)) – the "brain" that allows each [Agent](02_agent.md) to understand, reason, and generate text. Now we have agents that can think, perform [Task](03_task.md)s using [Tool](04_tool.md)s, and follow a [Process](05_process.md).
 11: 
 12: But imagine a team working on a complex project over several days. What if every morning, they completely forgot everything they discussed and learned the previous day? They'd waste a lot of time repeating work and asking the same questions. By default, AI agents often behave like this – they only remember the immediate conversation.
 13: 
 14: How can we give our CrewAI team the ability to remember past information? That's where **Memory** comes in!
 15: 
 16: ## Why Do We Need Memory?
 17: 
 18: AI Agents, especially when working together in a [Crew](01_crew.md), often need to build upon previous interactions or knowledge gained during their work. Without memory:
 19: 
 20: *   An agent might ask for the same information multiple times.
 21: *   Context from an earlier task might be lost by the time a later task runs.
 22: *   The crew can't easily learn from past experiences across different projects or runs.
 23: *   Tracking specific details about key people, places, or concepts mentioned during the process becomes difficult.
 24: 
 25: **Problem Solved:** Memory provides [Agent](02_agent.md)s and the [Crew](01_crew.md) with the ability to store and recall past interactions, information, and insights. It's like giving your AI team shared notes, a collective memory, or institutional knowledge.
 26: 
 27: ## What is Memory in CrewAI?
 28: 
 29: Think of Memory as the **storage system** for your Crew's experiences and knowledge. It allows the Crew to persist information beyond a single interaction or task execution. CrewAI implements different kinds of memory to handle different needs:
 30: 
 31: 1.  **`ShortTermMemory`**:
 32:     *   **Analogy:** Like your computer's RAM or a person's short-term working memory.
 33:     *   **Purpose:** Holds immediate context and information relevant *within the current run* of the Crew. What happened in the previous task? What was just discussed?
 34:     *   **How it helps:** Ensures that the output of one task is available and easily accessible as context for the next task within the same `kickoff()` execution. It helps maintain the flow of conversation and information *during* a single job.
 35: 
 36: 2.  **`LongTermMemory`**:
 37:     *   **Analogy:** Like a team's documented "lessons learned" database or a long-term knowledge base.
 38:     *   **Purpose:** Stores insights, evaluations, and key takeaways *across multiple runs* of the Crew. Did a similar task succeed or fail in the past? What strategies worked well?
 39:     *   **How it helps:** Allows the Crew to improve over time by recalling past performance on similar tasks. (Note: Effective use often involves evaluating task outcomes, which can be an advanced topic).
 40: 
 41: 3.  **`EntityMemory`**:
 42:     *   **Analogy:** Like a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system, a character sheet in a game, or index cards about important topics.
 43:     *   **Purpose:** Tracks specific entities (like people, companies, projects, concepts) mentioned during the Crew's execution and stores details and relationships about them. Who is "Dr. Evans"? What is "Project Phoenix"?
 44:     *   **How it helps:** Maintains consistency and detailed knowledge about key subjects, preventing the Crew from forgetting important details about who or what it's dealing with.
 45: 
 46: ## How Does Memory Help?
 47: 
 48: Using memory makes your Crew more effective:
 49: 
 50: *   **Better Context:** Agents have access to relevant past information, leading to more informed decisions and responses.
 51: *   **Efficiency:** Avoids redundant questions and re-work by recalling previously established facts or results.
 52: *   **Learning (LTM):** Enables the Crew to get better over time based on past performance.
 53: *   **Consistency (Entity):** Keeps track of important details about recurring topics or entities.
 54: *   **Shared Understanding:** Helps create a common ground of knowledge for all agents in the Crew.
 55: 
 56: ## Using Memory in Your Crew
 57: 
 58: The simplest way to start using memory is by enabling it when you define your `Crew`. Setting `memory=True` activates the core memory components (ShortTerm and Entity Memory) for context building within a run.
 59: 
 60: Let's add memory to our trip planning `Crew`:
 61: 
 62: ```python
 63: # Assuming 'researcher' and 'planner' agents are defined (Chapter 2)
 64: # Assuming 'task1' and 'task2' are defined (Chapter 3)
 65: # Assuming an LLM is configured (Chapter 6)
 66: 
 67: from crewai import Crew, Process
 68: 
 69: # researcher = Agent(...)
 70: # planner = Agent(...)
 71: # task1 = Task(...)
 72: # task2 = Task(...)
 73: 
 74: # Define the crew WITH memory enabled
 75: trip_crew_with_memory = Crew(
 76:   agents=[researcher, planner],
 77:   tasks=[task1, task2],
 78:   process=Process.sequential,
 79:   memory=True  # <-- Enable memory features!
 80:   # verbose=2
 81: )
 82: 
 83: # Start the work. Agents will now leverage memory.
 84: # result = trip_crew_with_memory.kickoff()
 85: # print(result)
 86: ```
 87: 
 88: **Explanation:**
 89: 
 90: *   We simply add the `memory=True` parameter when creating the `Crew`.
 91: *   **What does this do?** Behind the scenes, CrewAI initializes `ShortTermMemory` and `EntityMemory` for this crew.
 92: *   **How is it used?**
 93:     *   **ShortTermMemory:** As tasks complete within this `kickoff()` run, their outputs and key interactions can be stored. When the next task starts, CrewAI automatically queries this memory for relevant recent context to add to the prompt for the next agent. This makes the context flow smoother than just passing the raw output of the previous task.
 94:     *   **EntityMemory:** As agents discuss entities (e.g., "Lisbon," "May birthday trip"), the memory tries to capture details about them. If "Lisbon" is mentioned again later, the memory can provide the stored details ("Coastal city, known for trams and Fado music...") as context.
 95: *   **LongTermMemory:** While `memory=True` sets up the *potential* for LTM, actively using it to learn across multiple runs often requires additional steps like task evaluation or explicit saving mechanisms, which are more advanced topics beyond this basic introduction. For now, focus on the benefits of STM and Entity Memory for within-run context.
 96: 
 97: By just adding `memory=True`, your agents automatically get better at remembering what's going on *within the current job*.
 98: 
 99: ## How Memory Works Internally (Simplified)
100: 
101: So, what happens "under the hood" when `memory=True` and an agent starts a task?
102: 
103: 1.  **Task Execution Start:** The [Crew](01_crew.md) assigns a [Task](03_task.md) to an [Agent](02_agent.md).
104: 2.  **Context Gathering:** Before calling the [LLM](06_llm.md), the Crew interacts with its **Memory Module** (specifically, the `ContextualMemory` orchestrator). It asks, "What relevant memories do we have for this task, considering the description and any immediate context?"
105: 3.  **Memory Module Queries:** The `ContextualMemory` then queries the different active memory types:
106:     *   It asks `ShortTermMemory`: "Show me recent interactions or results related to this query." (Uses RAG/vector search on recent data).
107:     *   It asks `EntityMemory`: "Tell me about entities mentioned in this query." (Uses RAG/vector search on stored entity data).
108:     *   *If LTM were being actively queried (less common automatically):* "Any long-term insights related to this type of task?" (Usually queries a database like SQLite).
109: 4.  **Context Consolidation:** The Memory Module gathers the relevant snippets from each memory type.
110: 5.  **Prompt Augmentation:** This retrieved memory context is combined with the original task description, expected output, and any direct context (like the previous task's raw output).
111: 6.  **LLM Call:** This augmented, richer prompt is sent to the agent's [LLM](06_llm.md).
112: 7.  **Agent Response:** The agent generates its response, now informed by the retrieved memories.
113: 8.  **Memory Update:** As the task completes, its key interactions and outputs are processed and potentially saved back into ShortTermMemory and EntityMemory for future use within this run.
114: 
115: Let's visualize this context-building flow:
116: 
117: ```mermaid
118: sequenceDiagram

123:     participant EM as EntityMemory
124:     participant LLM as Agent's LLM
125: 
126:     C->>A: Execute Task(description, current_context)
127:     Note over A: Need to build full prompt context.
128:     A->>CtxMem: Get memory context for task query
129:     CtxMem->>STM: Search(task_query)
130:     STM-->>CtxMem: Recent memories (e.g., "Found Lisbon earlier")
131:     CtxMem->>EM: Search(task_query)
132:     EM-->>CtxMem: Entity details (e.g., "Lisbon: Capital of Portugal")
133:     CtxMem-->>A: Combined Memory Snippets
134:     A->>A: Assemble Final Prompt (Task Desc + Current Context + Memory Snippets)
135:     A->>LLM: Process Augmented Prompt
136:     LLM-->>A: Generate Response
137:     A-->>C: Task Result
138:     Note over C: Crew updates memories (STM, EM) with task results.
139: 
140: ```
141: 
142: **Diving into the Code (High Level)**
143: 
144: *   **`crewai/crew.py`:** When you set `memory=True` in the `Crew` constructor, the `create_crew_memory` validator method (triggered by Pydantic) initializes instances of `ShortTermMemory`, `LongTermMemory`, and `EntityMemory` and stores them in private attributes like `_short_term_memory`.
145: 
146:     ```python
147:     # Simplified from crewai/crew.py
148:     class Crew(BaseModel):
149:         memory: bool = Field(default=False, ...)
150:         _short_term_memory: Optional[InstanceOf[ShortTermMemory]] = PrivateAttr()
151:         _long_term_memory: Optional[InstanceOf[LongTermMemory]] = PrivateAttr()
152:         _entity_memory: Optional[InstanceOf[EntityMemory]] = PrivateAttr()
153:         # ... other fields ...
154: 
155:         @model_validator(mode="after")
156:         def create_crew_memory(self) -> "Crew":
157:             if self.memory:
158:                 # Simplified: Initializes memory objects if memory=True
159:                 self._long_term_memory = LongTermMemory(...)
160:                 self._short_term_memory = ShortTermMemory(crew=self, ...)
161:                 self._entity_memory = EntityMemory(crew=self, ...)
162:             return self
163:     ```
164: 
165: *   **`crewai/memory/contextual/contextual_memory.py`:** This class is responsible for orchestrating the retrieval from different memory types. Its `build_context_for_task` method takes the task information and queries the relevant memories.
166: 
167:     ```python
168:     # Simplified from crewai/memory/contextual/contextual_memory.py
169:     class ContextualMemory:
170:         def __init__(self, stm: ShortTermMemory, ltm: LongTermMemory, em: EntityMemory, ...):
171:             self.stm = stm
172:             self.ltm = ltm
173:             self.em = em

178:             if not query: return ""
179:

200: 
201: *   **Memory Types (`short_term_memory.py`, `entity_memory.py`, `long_term_memory.py`):**
202:     *   `ShortTermMemory` and `EntityMemory` typically use `RAGStorage` (`crewai/memory/storage/rag_storage.py`), which often relies on a vector database like ChromaDB to store embeddings of text snippets and find similar ones based on a query.
203:     *   `LongTermMemory` typically uses `LTMSQLiteStorage` (`crewai/memory/storage/ltm_sqlite_storage.py`) to save structured data about task evaluations (like descriptions, scores, suggestions) into an SQLite database file.
204: 
205: The key idea is that `memory=True` sets up these storage systems and the `ContextualMemory` orchestrator, which automatically enriches agent prompts with relevant remembered information.
206: 
207: ## Conclusion
208: 
209: You've learned about the crucial concept of **Memory** in CrewAI! Memory gives your agents the ability to recall past information, preventing them from being purely stateless. We explored the three main types:
210: 
211: *   **`ShortTermMemory`**: For context within the current run.
212: *   **`LongTermMemory`**: For insights across multiple runs (more advanced).
213: *   **`EntityMemory`**: For tracking specific people, places, or concepts.
214: 
215: Enabling memory with `memory=True` in your `Crew` is the first step to making your agents more context-aware and efficient, primarily leveraging Short Term and Entity memory automatically.
216: 
217: But what if your agents need access to a large body of pre-existing information, like company documentation, technical manuals, or a specific set of research papers? That's static information, not necessarily memories of *interactions*. How do we provide that? That's where the concept of **Knowledge** comes in. Let's explore that next!

  8: # Chapter 8: Knowledge - Providing External Information
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 7: Memory](07_memory.md), we learned how to give our [Crew](01_crew.md) the ability to remember past interactions and details using `Memory`. This helps them maintain context within a single run and potentially across runs.
 11: 
 12: But what if your [Agent](02_agent.md) needs access to a large body of *existing* information that isn't derived from its own conversations? Think about company documents, technical manuals, specific research papers, or a product catalog. This information exists *before* the Crew starts working. How do we give our agents access to this specific library of information?
 13: 
 14: That's where **`Knowledge`** comes in!
 15: 
 16: ## Why Do We Need Knowledge?
 17: 
 18: Imagine you have an [Agent](02_agent.md) whose job is to answer customer questions about a specific product, "Widget Pro". You want this agent to *only* use the official "Widget Pro User Manual" to answer questions, not its general knowledge from the internet (which might be outdated or wrong).
 19: 
 20: Without a way to provide the manual, the agent might hallucinate answers or use incorrect information. `Knowledge` allows us to load specific documents (like the user manual), process them, and make them searchable for our agents.
 21: 
 22: **Problem Solved:** `Knowledge` provides your [Agent](02_agent.md)s with access to specific, pre-defined external information sources (like documents or databases), allowing them to retrieve relevant context to enhance their understanding and task execution based on that specific information.
 23: 
 24: ## What is Knowledge?
 25: 
 26: Think of `Knowledge` as giving your [Crew](01_crew.md) access to a **specialized, private library** full of specific documents or information. It consists of a few key parts:
 27: 
 28: 1.  **`KnowledgeSource`**: This represents the actual *source* of the information. It could be:
 29:     *   A local file (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
 30:     *   A website URL
 31:     *   A database connection (more advanced)
 32:     CrewAI uses helpful classes like `CrewDoclingSource` to easily handle various file types and web content. You tell the `KnowledgeSource` *where* the information is (e.g., the file path to your user manual).
 33: 
 34: 2.  **Processing & Embedding**: When you create a `Knowledge` object with sources, the information is automatically:
 35:     *   **Loaded**: The content is read from the source (e.g., text extracted from the PDF).
 36:     *   **Chunked**: The long text is broken down into smaller, manageable pieces (chunks).
 37:     *   **Embedded**: Each chunk is converted into a numerical representation (an embedding vector) that captures its meaning. This is done using an embedding model (often specified via the `embedder` configuration).
 38: 
 39: 3.  **`KnowledgeStorage` (Vector Database)**: These embedded chunks are then stored in a special kind of database called a vector database. CrewAI typically uses **ChromaDB** by default for this.
 40:     *   **Why?** Vector databases are optimized for finding information based on *semantic similarity*. When an agent asks a question related to a topic, the database can quickly find the text chunks whose meanings (embeddings) are closest to the meaning of the question.
 41: 
 42: 4.  **Retrieval**: When an [Agent](02_agent.md) needs information for its [Task](03_task.md), it queries the `Knowledge` object. This query is also embedded, and the `KnowledgeStorage` efficiently retrieves the most relevant text chunks from the original documents. These chunks are then provided to the agent as context.
 43: 
 44: In short: `Knowledge` = Specific Info Sources + Processing/Embedding + Vector Storage + Retrieval.
 45: 
 46: ## Using Knowledge in Your Crew
 47: 
 48: Let's give our 'Product Support Agent' access to a hypothetical "widget_pro_manual.txt" file.
 49: 
 50: **1. Prepare Your Knowledge Source File:**
 51: 
 52: Make sure you have a directory named `knowledge` in your project's root folder. Place your file (e.g., `widget_pro_manual.txt`) inside this directory.
 53: 
 54: ```
 55: your_project_root/
 56: ├── knowledge/
 57: │   └── widget_pro_manual.txt
 58: └── your_crewai_script.py
 59: ```
 60: 
 61: *(Make sure `widget_pro_manual.txt` contains some text about Widget Pro.)*
 62: 
 63: **2. Define the Knowledge Source and Knowledge Object:**
 64: 
 65: ```python
 66: # Make sure you have docling installed for file handling: pip install docling
 67: from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process, Knowledge
 68: from crewai.knowledge.source.crew_docling_source import CrewDoclingSource
 69: # Assume an LLM is configured (e.g., via environment variables or passed to Agent/Crew)
 70: # from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
 71: 
 72: # Define the knowledge source - point to the file inside the 'knowledge' directory
 73: # Use the relative path from within the 'knowledge' directory
 74: manual_source = CrewDoclingSource(file_paths=["widget_pro_manual.txt"])
 75: 
 76: # Create the Knowledge object, give it a name and pass the sources
 77: # This will load, chunk, embed, and store the manual's content
 78: product_knowledge = Knowledge(
 79:     collection_name="widget_pro_manual", # Name for the storage collection
 80:     sources=[manual_source],
 81:     # embedder=... # Optional: specify embedding config, otherwise uses default
 82:     # storage=... # Optional: specify storage config, otherwise uses default ChromaDB
 83: )
 84: ```
 85: 
 86: **Explanation:**
 87: 
 88: *   We import `Knowledge` and `CrewDoclingSource`.
 89: *   `CrewDoclingSource(file_paths=["widget_pro_manual.txt"])`: We create a source pointing to our file. Note: The path is relative *within* the `knowledge` directory. `CrewDoclingSource` handles loading various file types.
 90: *   `Knowledge(collection_name="widget_pro_manual", sources=[manual_source])`: We create the main `Knowledge` object.
 91:     *   `collection_name`: A unique name for this set of knowledge in the vector database.
 92:     *   `sources`: A list containing the `manual_source` we defined.
 93:     *   When this line runs, CrewAI automatically processes `widget_pro_manual.txt` and stores it in the vector database under the collection "widget\_pro\_manual".
 94: 
 95: **3. Equip an Agent with Knowledge:**
 96: 
 97: You can add the `Knowledge` object directly to an agent.
 98: 
 99: ```python
100: # Define the agent and give it the knowledge base
101: support_agent = Agent(
102:     role='Product Support Specialist',
103:     goal='Answer customer questions accurately based ONLY on the Widget Pro manual.',
104:     backstory='You are an expert support agent with deep knowledge of the Widget Pro, derived exclusively from its official manual.',
105:     knowledge=product_knowledge, # <-- Assign the knowledge here!
106:     verbose=True,
107:     allow_delegation=False,
108:     # llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4") # Example LLM
109: )
110: 
111: # Define a task for the agent
112: support_task = Task(
113:     description="The customer asks: 'How do I reset my Widget Pro?' Use the manual to find the answer.",
114:     expected_output="A clear, step-by-step answer based solely on the provided manual content.",
115:     agent=support_agent
116: )
117: 
118: # Create and run the crew
119: support_crew = Crew(
120:     agents=[support_agent],
121:     tasks=[support_task],
122:     process=Process.sequential
123: )
124: 
125: # result = support_crew.kickoff()
126: # print(result)
127: ```
128: 
129: **Explanation:**
130: 
131: *   When defining `support_agent`, we pass our `product_knowledge` object to the `knowledge` parameter: `knowledge=product_knowledge`.
132: *   Now, whenever `support_agent` works on a `Task`, it will automatically query the `product_knowledge` base for relevant information *before* calling its [LLM](06_llm.md).
133: *   The retrieved text chunks from `widget_pro_manual.txt` will be added to the context given to the [LLM](06_llm.md), strongly guiding it to answer based on the manual.
134: 
135: **Expected Outcome (Conceptual):**
136: 
137: When `support_crew.kickoff()` runs:
138: 
139: 1.  `support_agent` receives `support_task`.
140: 2.  The agent (internally) queries `product_knowledge` with something like "How do I reset my Widget Pro?".
141: 3.  The vector database finds chunks from `widget_pro_manual.txt` that are semantically similar (e.g., sections describing the reset procedure).
142: 4.  These relevant text chunks are retrieved.
143: 5.  The agent's [LLM](06_llm.md) receives the task description *plus* the retrieved manual excerpts as context.
144: 6.  The [LLM](06_llm.md) generates the answer based heavily on the provided manual text.
145: 7.  The final `result` will be the step-by-step reset instructions derived from the manual.
146: 
147: *(Alternatively, you can assign `Knowledge` at the `Crew` level using the `knowledge` parameter, making it available to all agents in the crew.)*
148: 
149: ## How Knowledge Retrieval Works Internally
150: 
151: When an [Agent](02_agent.md) with assigned `Knowledge` executes a [Task](03_task.md):
152: 
153: 1.  **Task Start:** The agent begins processing the task.
154: 2.  **Context Building:** The agent prepares the information needed for its [LLM](06_llm.md). This includes the task description, its role/goal/backstory, and any context from `Memory` (if enabled).
155: 3.  **Knowledge Query:** The agent identifies the need for information related to the task. It formulates a query (often based on the task description or key terms) and sends it to its assigned `Knowledge` object.
156: 4.  **Storage Search:** The `Knowledge` object passes the query to its underlying `KnowledgeStorage` (the vector database, e.g., ChromaDB).
157: 5.  **Vector Similarity Search:** The vector database converts the query into an embedding and searches for stored text chunks whose embeddings are closest (most similar) to the query embedding.
158: 6.  **Retrieve Chunks:** The database returns the top N most relevant text chunks (along with metadata and scores).
159: 7.  **Augment Prompt:** The agent takes these retrieved text chunks and adds them as specific context to the prompt it's preparing for the [LLM](06_llm.md). The prompt might now look something like: "Your task is: [...task description...]. Here is relevant information from the knowledge base: [...retrieved chunk 1...] [...retrieved chunk 2...] Now, provide the final answer."
160: 8.  **LLM Call:** The agent sends this augmented prompt to its [LLM](06_llm.md).
161: 9.  **Generate Response:** The [LLM](06_llm.md), now equipped with highly relevant context directly from the specified knowledge source, generates a more accurate and grounded response.
162: 
163: Let's visualize this retrieval process:
164: 
165: ```mermaid
166: sequenceDiagram
167:     participant A as Agent
168:     participant K as Knowledge Object
169:     participant KS as KnowledgeStorage (Vector DB)
170:     participant LLM as Agent's LLM
171: 
172:     A->>A: Start Task ('How to reset Widget Pro?')
173:     A->>A: Prepare base prompt (Task, Role, Goal...)
174:     A->>K: Query('How to reset Widget Pro?')
175:     K->>KS: Search(query='How to reset Widget Pro?')
176:     Note right of KS: Finds similar chunks via embeddings
177:     KS-->>K: Return relevant chunks from manual
178:     K-->>A: Provide relevant chunks
179:     A->>A: Augment prompt with retrieved chunks
180:     A->>LLM: Send augmented prompt
181:     LLM-->>A: Generate answer based on task + manual excerpts
182:     A->>A: Final Answer (Steps from manual)
183: ```
184: 
185: ## Diving into the Code (High Level)
186: 
187: *   **`crewai/knowledge/knowledge.py`**:
188:     *   The `Knowledge` class holds the list of `sources` and the `storage` object.
189:     *   Its `__init__` method initializes the `KnowledgeStorage` (creating a default ChromaDB instance if none is provided) and then iterates through the `sources`, telling each one to `add()` its content to the storage.
190:     *   The `query()` method simply delegates the search request to the `self.storage.search()` method.
191: 
192:     ```python
193:     # Simplified view from crewai/knowledge/knowledge.py
194:     class Knowledge(BaseModel):
195:         sources: List[BaseKnowledgeSource] = Field(default_factory=list)
196:         storage: Optional[KnowledgeStorage] = Field(default=None)
197:         embedder: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
198:         collection_name: Optional[str] = None
199: 
200:         def __init__(self, collection_name: str, sources: List[BaseKnowledgeSource], ...):
201:             # ... setup storage (e.g., KnowledgeStorage(...)) ...
202:             self.sources = sources
203:             self.storage.initialize_knowledge_storage()
204:             self._add_sources() # Tell sources to load/chunk/embed/save
205: 
206:         def query(self, query: List[str], limit: int = 3) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
207:             if self.storage is None: raise ValueError("Storage not initialized.")
208:             # Delegate search to the storage object
209:             return self.storage.search(query, limit)
210: 
211:         def _add_sources(self):
212:             for source in self.sources:
213:                 source.storage = self.storage # Give source access to storage
214:                 source.add() # Source loads, chunks, embeds, and saves
215:     ```
216: 
217: *   **`crewai/knowledge/source/`**: Contains different `KnowledgeSource` implementations.
218:     *   `base_knowledge_source.py`: Defines the `BaseKnowledgeSource` abstract class, including the `add()` method placeholder and helper methods like `_chunk_text()`.
219:     *   `crew_docling_source.py`: Implements loading from files and URLs using the `docling` library. Its `add()` method loads content, chunks it, and calls `self._save_documents()`.
220:     *   `_save_documents()` (in `base_knowledge_source.py` or subclasses) typically calls `self.storage.save(self.chunks)`.
221: 
222: *   **`crewai/knowledge/storage/knowledge_storage.py`**:
223:     *   The `KnowledgeStorage` class acts as a wrapper around the actual vector database (ChromaDB by default).
224:     *   `initialize_knowledge_storage()`: Sets up the connection to ChromaDB and gets/creates the specified collection.
225:     *   `save()`: Takes the text chunks, gets their embeddings using the configured `embedder`, and `upsert`s them into the ChromaDB collection.
226:     *   `search()`: Takes a query, gets its embedding, and uses the ChromaDB collection's `query()` method to find and return similar documents.
227: 
228: *   **`crewai/agent.py`**:
229:     *   The `Agent` class has an optional `knowledge: Knowledge` attribute.
230:     *   In the `execute_task` method, before calling the LLM, if `self.knowledge` exists, it calls `self.knowledge.query()` using the task prompt (or parts of it) as the query.
231:     *   The results from `knowledge.query()` are formatted and added to the task prompt as additional context.
232: 
233:     ```python
234:     # Simplified view from crewai/agent.py
235:     class Agent(BaseAgent):
236:         knowledge: Optional[Knowledge] = Field(default=None, ...)
237:         # ... other fields ...
238: 
239:         def execute_task(self, task: Task, context: Optional[str] = None, ...) -> str:
240:             task_prompt = task.prompt()
241:             # ... add memory context if applicable ...
242: 
243:             # === KNOWLEDGE RETRIEVAL ===
244:             if self.knowledge:
245:                 # Query the knowledge base using the task prompt
246:                 agent_knowledge_snippets = self.knowledge.query([task_prompt]) # Or task.description
247:                 if agent_knowledge_snippets:
248:                     # Format the snippets into context string
249:                     agent_knowledge_context = extract_knowledge_context(agent_knowledge_snippets)
250:                     if agent_knowledge_context:
251:                         # Add knowledge context to the prompt
252:                         task_prompt += agent_knowledge_context
253:             # ===========================
254: 
255:             # ... add crew knowledge context if applicable ...
256:             # ... prepare tools, create agent_executor ...
257: 
258:             # Call the LLM via agent_executor with the augmented task_prompt
259:             result = self.agent_executor.invoke({"input": task_prompt, ...})["output"]
260:             return result
261:     ```
262: 
263: ## Conclusion
264: 
265: You've now learned about **`Knowledge`** in CrewAI! It's the mechanism for providing your agents with access to specific, pre-existing external information sources like documents or websites. By defining `KnowledgeSource`s, creating a `Knowledge` object, and assigning it to an [Agent](02_agent.md) or [Crew](01_crew.md), you enable your agents to retrieve relevant context from these sources using vector search. This makes their responses more accurate, grounded, and aligned with the specific information you provide, distinct from the general interaction history managed by [Memory](07_memory.md).
266: 
267: This concludes our introductory tour of the core concepts in CrewAI! You've learned about managing the team ([Crew](01_crew.md)), defining specialized workers ([Agent](02_agent.md)), assigning work ([Task](03_task.md)), equipping agents with abilities ([Tool](04_tool.md)), setting the workflow ([Process](05_process.md)), powering the agent's thinking ([LLM](06_llm.md)), giving them recall ([Memory](07_memory.md)), and providing external information ([Knowledge](08_knowledge.md)).
268: 
269: With these building blocks, you're ready to start creating sophisticated AI crews to tackle complex challenges! Happy building!

13: Think of it like building a specialized team (a **Crew**) where each member (**Agent**) has a role, goal, and tools.
14: You assign **Tasks** to Agents, defining what needs to be done. The **Crew** manages how these Agents collaborate, following a specific **Process** (like sequential steps).
15: Agents use their "brain" (an **LLM**) and can utilize **Tools** (like web search) and access shared **Memory** or external **Knowledge** bases to complete their tasks effectively.

  8: # Chapter 1: Modules and Programs: Building Blocks of DSPy
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the first chapter of our journey into DSPy! We're excited to have you here.
 11: 
 12: Imagine you want to build something cool with AI, like a smart assistant that can answer questions based on your documents. This involves several steps: understanding the question, finding the right information in the documents, and then crafting a clear answer. How do you organize all these steps in your code?
 13: 
 14: That's where **Modules** and **Programs** come in! They are the fundamental building blocks in DSPy, helping you structure your AI applications cleanly and effectively.
 15: 
 16: Think of it like building with **Lego bricks**:
 17: 
 18: *   A **`Module`** is like a single Lego brick. It's a basic unit that performs a specific, small task.
 19: *   A **`Program`** is like your final Lego creation (a car, a house). It's built by combining several Lego bricks (`Module`s) together in a specific way to achieve a bigger goal.
 20: 
 21: In this chapter, we'll learn:
 22: 
 23: *   What a `Module` is and what it does.
 24: *   How `Program`s use `Module`s to solve complex tasks.
 25: *   How they create structure and manage the flow of information.
 26: 
 27: Let's start building!
 28: 
 29: ## What is a `Module`?
 30: 
 31: A `dspy.Module` is the most basic building block in DSPy. Think of it as:
 32: 
 33: *   **A Function:** Like a function in Python, it takes some input, does something, and produces an output.
 34: *   **A Lego Brick:** It performs one specific job.
 35: *   **A Specialist:** It often specializes in one task, frequently involving interaction with a powerful AI model like a Language Model ([LM](05_lm__language_model_client_.md)) or a Retrieval Model ([RM](06_rm__retrieval_model_client_.md)). We'll learn more about LMs and RMs later!
 36: 
 37: The key idea is **encapsulation**. A `Module` bundles a piece of logic together, hiding the internal complexity. You just need to know what it does, not necessarily *every single detail* of how it does it.
 38: 
 39: Every `Module` has two main parts:
 40: 
 41: 1.  `__init__`: This is where you set up the module, like defining any internal components or settings it needs.
 42: 2.  `forward`: This is where the main logic happens. It defines *what the module does* when you call it with some input.
 43: 
 44: Let's look at a conceptual example. DSPy provides pre-built modules. One common one is `dspy.Predict`, which is designed to call a Language Model to generate an output based on some input, following specific instructions.
 45: 
 46: ```python
 47: import dspy
 48: 
 49: # Conceptual structure of a simple Module like dspy.Predict
 50: class BasicPredict(dspy.Module): # Inherits from dspy.Module
 51:     def __init__(self, instructions):
 52:         super().__init__() # Important initialization
 53:         self.instructions = instructions
 54:         # In a real DSPy module, we'd set up LM connection here
 55:         # self.lm = ... (connect to language model)
 56: 
 57:     def forward(self, input_data):
 58:         # 1. Combine instructions and input_data
 59:         prompt = self.instructions + "\nInput: " + input_data + "\nOutput:"
 60: 
 61:         # 2. Call the Language Model (LM) with the prompt
 62:         # lm_output = self.lm(prompt) # Simplified call
 63:         lm_output = f"Generated answer for '{input_data}' based on instructions." # Dummy output
 64: 
 65:         # 3. Return the result
 66:         return lm_output
 67: 
 68: # How you might use it (conceptual)
 69: # predictor = BasicPredict(instructions="Translate the input to French.")
 70: # french_text = predictor(input_data="Hello")
 71: # print(french_text) # Might output: "Generated answer for 'Hello' based on instructions."
 72: ```
 73: 
 74: In this simplified view:
 75: 
 76: *   `BasicPredict` inherits from `dspy.Module`. All your custom modules will do this.
 77: *   `__init__` stores the `instructions`. Real DSPy modules might initialize connections to LMs or load settings here.
 78: *   `forward` defines the core task: combining instructions and input, (conceptually) calling an LM, and returning the result.
 79: 
 80: Don't worry about the LM details yet! The key takeaway is that a `Module` wraps a specific piece of work, defined in its `forward` method. DSPy provides useful pre-built modules like `dspy.Predict` and `dspy.ChainOfThought` (which encourages step-by-step reasoning), and you can also build your own.
 81: 
 82: ## What is a `Program`?
 83: 
 84: Now, what if your task is more complex than a single LM call? For instance, answering a question based on documents might involve:
 85: 
 86: 1.  Understanding the `question`.
 87: 2.  Generating search queries based on the `question`.
 88: 3.  Using a Retrieval Model ([RM](06_rm__retrieval_model_client_.md)) to find relevant `context` documents using the queries.
 89: 4.  Using a Language Model ([LM](05_lm__language_model_client_.md)) to generate the final `answer` based on the `question` and `context`.
 90: 
 91: This is too much for a single simple `Module`. We need to combine multiple modules!
 92: 
 93: This is where a `Program` comes in. **Technically, a `Program` in DSPy is also just a `dspy.Module`!** The difference is in how we use it: a `Program` is typically a `Module` that *contains and coordinates other `Module`s*.
 94: 
 95: Think back to the Lego analogy:
 96: 
 97: *   Small `Module`s are like bricks for the engine, wheels, and chassis.
 98: *   The `Program` is the main `Module` representing the whole car, defining how the engine, wheels, and chassis bricks connect and work together in its `forward` method.
 99: 
100: A `Program` defines the **data flow** between its sub-modules. It orchestrates the sequence of operations.
101: 
102: Let's sketch out a simple `Program` for our question-answering example:
103: 
104: ```python
105: import dspy
106: 
107: # Assume we have these pre-built or custom Modules (simplified)
108: class GenerateSearchQuery(dspy.Module):
109:     def forward(self, question):
110:         # Logic to create search queries from the question
111:         print(f"Generating query for: {question}")
112:         return f"search query for '{question}'"
113: 
114: class RetrieveContext(dspy.Module):
115:     def forward(self, query):
116:         # Logic to find documents using the query
117:         print(f"Retrieving context for: {query}")
118:         return f"Relevant context document about '{query}'"
119: 
120: class GenerateAnswer(dspy.Module):
121:     def forward(self, question, context):
122:         # Logic to generate answer using question and context
123:         print(f"Generating answer for: {question} using context: {context}")
124:         return f"Final answer about '{question}' based on context."
125: 
126: # Now, let's build the Program (which is also a Module!)
127: class RAG(dspy.Module): # RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation
128:     def __init__(self):
129:         super().__init__()
130:         # Initialize the sub-modules it will use
131:         self.generate_query = GenerateSearchQuery()
132:         self.retrieve = RetrieveContext()
133:         self.generate_answer = GenerateAnswer()
134: 
135:     def forward(self, question):
136:         # Define the flow of data through the sub-modules
137:         print("\n--- RAG Program Start ---")
138:         search_query = self.generate_query(question=question)
139:         context = self.retrieve(query=search_query)
140:         answer = self.generate_answer(question=question, context=context)
141:         print("--- RAG Program End ---")
142:         return answer
143: 
144: # How to use the Program
145: rag_program = RAG()
146: final_answer = rag_program(question="What is DSPy?")
147: print(f"\nFinal Output: {final_answer}")
148: ```
149: 
150: If you run this conceptual code, you'd see output like:
151: 
152: ```
153: --- RAG Program Start ---
154: Generating query for: What is DSPy?
155: Retrieving context for: search query for 'What is DSPy?'
156: Generating answer for: What is DSPy? using context: Relevant context document about 'search query for 'What is DSPy?''
157: --- RAG Program End ---
158: 
159: Final Output: Final answer about 'What is DSPy?' based on context.
160: ```
161: 
162: See how the `RAG` program works?
163: 
164: 1.  In `__init__`, it creates instances of the smaller modules it needs (`GenerateSearchQuery`, `RetrieveContext`, `GenerateAnswer`).
165: 2.  In `forward`, it calls these modules *in order*, passing the output of one as the input to the next. It defines the workflow!
166: 
167: ## Hierarchical Structure
168: 
169: Modules can contain other modules, which can contain *even more* modules! This allows you to build complex systems by breaking them down into manageable, hierarchical parts.
170: 
171: Imagine our `GenerateAnswer` module was actually quite complex. Maybe it first summarizes the context, then drafts an answer, then refines it. We could implement `GenerateAnswer` as *another* program containing these sub-modules!
172: 
173: ```mermaid
174: graph TD
175:     A[RAG Program] --> B(GenerateSearchQuery Module);
176:     A --> C(RetrieveContext Module);
177:     A --> D(GenerateAnswer Module / Program);
178:     D --> D1(SummarizeContext Module);
179:     D --> D2(DraftAnswer Module);
180:     D --> D3(RefineAnswer Module);
181: ```
182: 
183: This diagram shows how the `RAG` program uses `GenerateAnswer`, which itself could be composed of smaller modules like `SummarizeContext`, `DraftAnswer`, and `RefineAnswer`. This nesting makes complex systems easier to design, understand, and debug.
184: 
185: ## How It Works Under the Hood (A Tiny Peek)
186: 
187: You don't need to know the deep internals right now, but it's helpful to have a basic mental model.
188: 
189: 1.  **Foundation:** All DSPy modules, whether simple bricks or complex programs, inherit from a base class (`dspy.primitives.module.BaseModule`). This provides common functionality like saving, loading, and finding internal parameters (we'll touch on saving/loading later).
190: 2.  **Execution:** When you call a module (e.g., `rag_program(question="...")`), Python executes its `__call__` method. In DSPy, this typically just calls the `forward` method you defined.
191: 3.  **Orchestration:** If a module's `forward` method calls other modules (like in our `RAG` example), it simply executes their `forward` methods in turn, passing the data as defined in the code.
192: 
193: Here's a simplified sequence of what happens when we call `rag_program("What is DSPy?")`:
194: 
195: ```mermaid
196: sequenceDiagram
197:     participant User
198:     participant RAGProgram as RAG Program (forward)
199:     participant GenQuery as GenerateQuery (forward)
200:     participant Retrieve as RetrieveContext (forward)
201:     participant GenAnswer as GenerateAnswer (forward)
202: 
203:     User->>RAGProgram: Call with "What is DSPy?"
204:     RAGProgram->>GenQuery: Call with question="What is DSPy?"
205:     GenQuery-->>RAGProgram: Return "search query..."
206:     RAGProgram->>Retrieve: Call with query="search query..."
207:     Retrieve-->>RAGProgram: Return "Relevant context..."
208:     RAGProgram->>GenAnswer: Call with question, context
209:     GenAnswer-->>RAGProgram: Return "Final answer..."
210:     RAGProgram-->>User: Return "Final answer..."
211: ```
212: 
213: The core files involved are:
214: 
215: *   `primitives/module.py`: Defines the `BaseModule` class, the ancestor of all modules.
216: *   `primitives/program.py`: Defines the `Module` class (which you inherit from) itself, adding core methods like `__call__` that invokes `forward`.
217: 
218: You can see from the code snippets provided earlier (like `ChainOfThought` or `Predict`) that they inherit from `dspy.Module` and define `__init__` and `forward`, just like our examples.
219: 
220: ```python
221: # Snippet from dspy/primitives/program.py (Simplified)
222: from dspy.primitives.module import BaseModule
223: 
224: class Module(BaseModule): # Inherits from BaseModule
225:     def __init__(self):
226:         super()._base_init()
227:         # ... initialization ...
228: 
229:     def forward(self, *args, **kwargs):
230:         # This is where the main logic of the module goes.
231:         # Users override this method in their own modules.
232:         raise NotImplementedError # Needs to be implemented by subclasses
233: 
234:     def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
235:         # When you call module_instance(), this runs...
236:         # ...and typically calls self.forward()
237:         return self.forward(*args, **kwargs)
238: 
239: # You write classes like this:
240: class MyModule(dspy.Module):
241:     def __init__(self):
242:         super().__init__()
243:         # Your setup
244: 
245:     def forward(self, input_data):
246:         # Your logic
247:         result = ...
248:         return result
249: ```
250: 
251: The important part is the pattern: inherit from `dspy.Module`, set things up in `__init__`, and define the core logic in `forward`.
252: 
253: ## Conclusion
254: 
255: Congratulations! You've learned about the fundamental organizing principle in DSPy: **Modules** and **Programs**.
256: 
257: *   **Modules** are the basic building blocks, like Lego bricks, often handling a specific task (maybe calling an [LM](05_lm__language_model_client_.md) or [RM](06_rm__retrieval_model_client_.md)).
258: *   **Programs** are also Modules, but they typically combine *other* modules to orchestrate a more complex workflow, defining how data flows between them.
259: *   The `forward` method is key – it contains the logic of what a module *does*.
260: *   This structure allows you to build complex AI systems in a clear, manageable, and hierarchical way.
261: 
262: Now that we understand how modules provide structure, how do they know what kind of input data they expect and what kind of output data they should produce? That's where **Signatures** come in!
263: 
264: Let's dive into that next!
265: 
266: **Next:** [Chapter 2: Signature](02_signature.md)

  8: # Chapter 2: Signatures - Defining the Task
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: Modules and Programs](01_module___program.md), we learned that `Module`s are like Lego bricks that perform specific tasks, often using Language Models ([LM](05_lm__language_model_client_.md)). We saw how `Program`s combine these modules.
 11: 
 12: But how does a `Module`, especially one using an LM like `dspy.Predict`, know *exactly* what job to do?
 13: 
 14: Imagine you ask a chef (our LM) to cook something. Just saying "cook" isn't enough! You need to tell them:
 15: 1.  **What ingredients to use** (the inputs).
 16: 2.  **What dish to make** (the outputs).
 17: 3.  **The recipe or instructions** (how to make it).
 18: 
 19: This is precisely what a **`Signature`** does in DSPy!
 20: 
 21: A `Signature` acts like a clear recipe or contract for a DSPy `Module`. It defines:
 22: 
 23: *   **Input Fields:** What information the module needs to start its work.
 24: *   **Output Fields:** What information the module is expected to produce.
 25: *   **Instructions:** Natural language guidance (like a recipe!) telling the underlying LM *how* to transform the inputs into the outputs.
 26: 
 27: Think of it as specifying the 'shape' and 'purpose' of a module, making sure everyone (you, DSPy, and the LM) understands the task.
 28: 
 29: ## Why Do We Need Signatures?
 30: 
 31: Without a clear definition, how would a module like `dspy.Predict` know what to ask the LM?
 32: 
 33: Let's say we want a module to translate English text to French. We need to tell it:
 34: *   It needs an `english_sentence` as input.
 35: *   It should produce a `french_sentence` as output.
 36: *   The *task* is to translate the input sentence into French.
 37: 
 38: A `Signature` bundles all this information together neatly.
 39: 
 40: ## Defining a Signature: The Recipe Card
 41: 
 42: The most common way to define a Signature is by creating a Python class that inherits from `dspy.Signature`.
 43: 
 44: Let's create our English-to-French translation signature:
 45: 
 46: ```python
 47: import dspy
 48: from dspy.signatures.field import InputField, OutputField
 49: 
 50: class TranslateToFrench(dspy.Signature):
 51:     """Translates English text to French.""" # <-- These are the Instructions!
 52: 
 53:     # Define the Input Field the module expects
 54:     english_sentence = dspy.InputField(desc="The original sentence in English")
 55: 
 56:     # Define the Output Field the module should produce
 57:     french_sentence = dspy.OutputField(desc="The translated sentence in French")
 58: 
 59: ```
 60: 
 61: Let's break this down:
 62: 
 63: 1.  **`class TranslateToFrench(dspy.Signature):`**: We declare a new class named `TranslateToFrench` that inherits from `dspy.Signature`. This tells DSPy it's a signature definition.
 64: 2.  **`"""Translates English text to French."""`**: This is the **docstring**. It's crucial! DSPy uses this docstring as the natural language **Instructions** for the LM. It tells the LM the *goal* of the task.
 65: 3.  **`english_sentence = dspy.InputField(...)`**: We define an input field named `english_sentence`. `dspy.InputField` marks this as required input. The `desc` provides a helpful description (good for documentation and potentially useful for the LM later).
 66: 4.  **`french_sentence = dspy.OutputField(...)`**: We define an output field named `french_sentence`. `dspy.OutputField` marks this as the expected output. The `desc` describes what this field should contain.
 67: 
 68: That's it! We've created a reusable "recipe card" that clearly defines our translation task.
 69: 
 70: ## How Modules Use Signatures
 71: 
 72: Now, how does a `Module` like `dspy.Predict` use this `TranslateToFrench` signature?
 73: 
 74: `dspy.Predict` is a pre-built module designed to take a signature and use an LM to generate the output fields based on the input fields and instructions.
 75: 
 76: Here's how you might use our signature with `dspy.Predict` (we'll cover `dspy.Predict` in detail in [Chapter 4](04_predict.md)):
 77: 
 78: ```python
 79: # Assume 'lm' is a configured Language Model client (more in Chapter 5)
 80: # lm = dspy.OpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo')
 81: # dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)
 82: 
 83: # Create an instance of dspy.Predict, giving it our Signature
 84: translator = dspy.Predict(TranslateToFrench)
 85: 
 86: # Call the predictor with the required input field
 87: english = "Hello, how are you?"
 88: result = translator(english_sentence=english)
 89: 
 90: # The result object will contain the output field defined in the signature
 91: print(f"English: {english}")
 92: # Assuming the LM works correctly, it might print:
 93: # print(f"French: {result.french_sentence}") # => French: Bonjour, comment ça va?
 94: ```
 95: 
 96: In this (slightly simplified) example:
 97: 
 98: 1.  `translator = dspy.Predict(TranslateToFrench)`: We create a `Predict` module. Crucially, we pass our `TranslateToFrench` **class** itself to it. `dspy.Predict` now knows the input/output fields and the instructions from the signature.
 99: 2.  `result = translator(english_sentence=english)`: When we call the `translator`, we provide the input data using the exact name defined in our signature (`english_sentence`).
100: 3.  `result.french_sentence`: `dspy.Predict` uses the LM, guided by the signature's instructions and fields, to generate the output. It then returns an object where you can access the generated French text using the output field name (`french_sentence`).
101: 
102: The `Signature` acts as the bridge, ensuring the `Predict` module knows its job specification.
103: 
104: ## How It Works Under the Hood (A Peek)
105: 
106: You don't need to memorize this, but understanding the flow helps! When a module like `dspy.Predict` uses a `Signature`:
107: 
108: 1.  **Inspection:** The module looks at the `Signature` class (`TranslateToFrench` in our case).
109: 2.  **Extract Info:** It identifies the `InputField`s (`english_sentence`), `OutputField`s (`french_sentence`), and the `Instructions` (the docstring: `"Translates English text to French."`).
110: 3.  **Prompt Formatting:** When you call the module (e.g., `translator(english_sentence="Hello")`), it uses this information to build a prompt for the [LM](05_lm__language_model_client_.md). This prompt typically includes:
111:     *   The **Instructions**.
112:     *   Clearly labeled **Input Fields** and their values.
113:     *   Clearly labeled **Output Fields** (often just the names, indicating what the LM should generate).
114: 4.  **LM Call:** The formatted prompt is sent to the configured LM.
115: 5.  **Parsing Output:** The LM's response is received. DSPy tries to parse this response to extract the values for the defined `OutputField`s (like `french_sentence`).
116: 6.  **Return Result:** A structured result object containing the parsed outputs is returned.
117: 
118: Let's visualize this flow:
119: 
120: ```mermaid
121: sequenceDiagram
122:     participant User
123:     participant PredictModule as dspy.Predict(TranslateToFrench)
124:     participant Signature as TranslateToFrench
125:     participant LM as Language Model
126: 
127:     User->>PredictModule: Call with english_sentence="Hello"

135: ```
136: 
137: The core logic for defining signatures resides in:
138: 
139: *   `dspy/signatures/signature.py`: Defines the base `Signature` class and the logic for handling instructions and fields.
140: *   `dspy/signatures/field.py`: Defines `InputField` and `OutputField`.
141: 
142: Modules like `dspy.Predict` (in `dspy/predict/predict.py`) contain the code to *read* these Signatures and interact with LMs accordingly.
143: 
144: ```python
145: # Simplified view inside dspy/signatures/signature.py
146: from pydantic import BaseModel
147: from pydantic.fields import FieldInfo
148: # ... other imports ...
149: 
150: class SignatureMeta(type(BaseModel)):
151:     # Metaclass magic to handle fields and docstring
152:     def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace, **kwargs):
153:         # ... logic to find fields, handle docstring ...
154:         cls = super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace, **kwargs)
155:         cls.__doc__ = cls.__doc__ or _default_instructions(cls) # Default instructions if none provided
156:         # ... logic to validate fields ...
157:         return cls
158: 
159:     @property
160:     def instructions(cls) -> str:
161:         # Retrieves the docstring as instructions
162:         return inspect.cleandoc(getattr(cls, "__doc__", ""))
163: 
164:     @property
165:     def input_fields(cls) -> dict[str, FieldInfo]:
166:         # Finds fields marked as input
167:         return cls._get_fields_with_type("input")
168: 
169:     @property
170:     def output_fields(cls) -> dict[str, FieldInfo]:
171:         # Finds fields marked as output
172:         return cls._get_fields_with_type("output")
173: 
174: class Signature(BaseModel, metaclass=SignatureMeta):
175:     # The base class you inherit from
176:     pass
177: 
178: # Simplified view inside dspy/signatures/field.py
179: import pydantic
180: 
181: def InputField(**kwargs):
182:     # Creates a Pydantic field marked as input for DSPy
183:     return pydantic.Field(**move_kwargs(**kwargs, __dspy_field_type="input"))
184: 
185: def OutputField(**kwargs):
186:     # Creates a Pydantic field marked as output for DSPy
187:     return pydantic.Field(**move_kwargs(**kwargs, __dspy_field_type="output"))
188: 
189: ```
190: 
191: The key takeaway is that the `Signature` class structure (using `InputField`, `OutputField`, and the docstring) provides a standardized way for modules to understand the task specification.
192: 
193: ## Conclusion
194: 
195: You've now learned about `Signatures`, the essential component for defining *what* a DSPy module should do!
196: 
197: *   A `Signature` specifies the **Inputs**, **Outputs**, and **Instructions** for a task.
198: *   It acts like a contract or recipe card for modules, especially those using LMs.
199: *   You typically define them by subclassing `dspy.Signature`, using `InputField`, `OutputField`, and a descriptive **docstring** for instructions.
200: *   Modules like `dspy.Predict` use Signatures to understand the task and generate appropriate prompts for the LM.
201: 
202: Signatures bring clarity and structure to LM interactions. But how do we provide concrete examples to help the LM learn or perform better? That's where `Examples` come in!

  8: # Chapter 3: Example - Your Data Points
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 2: Signature](02_signature.md), we learned how to define the *task* for a DSPy module using `Signatures` – specifying the inputs, outputs, and instructions. It's like writing a recipe card.
 11: 
 12: But sometimes, just giving instructions isn't enough. Imagine teaching someone to translate by just giving the rule "Translate English to French". They might struggle! It often helps to show them a few *examples* of correct translations.
 13: 
 14: This is where **`dspy.Example`** comes in! It's how you represent individual data points or examples within DSPy.
 15: 
 16: Think of a `dspy.Example` as:
 17: 
 18: *   **A Single Row:** Like one row in a spreadsheet or database table.
 19: *   **A Flashcard:** Holding a specific question and its answer, or an input and its desired output.
 20: *   **A Test Case:** A concrete instance of the task defined by your `Signature`.
 21: 
 22: In this chapter, we'll learn:
 23: 
 24: *   What a `dspy.Example` is and how it stores data.
 25: *   How to create `Example` objects.
 26: *   Why `Example`s are essential for few-shot learning, training, and evaluation.
 27: *   How to mark specific fields as inputs using `.with_inputs()`.
 28: 
 29: Let's dive into representing our data!
 30: 
 31: ## What is a `dspy.Example`?
 32: 
 33: A `dspy.Example` is a fundamental data structure in DSPy designed to hold the information for a single instance of your task. It essentially acts like a flexible container (similar to a Python dictionary) where you store key-value pairs.
 34: 
 35: Crucially, the **keys** in your `Example` should generally match the **field names** you defined in your [Signature](02_signature.md).
 36: 
 37: Let's revisit our `TranslateToFrench` signature from Chapter 2:
 38: 
 39: ```python
 40: # From Chapter 2
 41: import dspy
 42: from dspy.signatures.field import InputField, OutputField
 43: 
 44: class TranslateToFrench(dspy.Signature):
 45:     """Translates English text to French."""
 46:     english_sentence = dspy.InputField(desc="The original sentence in English")
 47:     french_sentence = dspy.OutputField(desc="The translated sentence in French")
 48: ```
 49: 
 50: This signature has two fields: `english_sentence` (input) and `french_sentence` (output).
 51: 
 52: An `Example` representing one instance of this task would need to contain values for these keys.
 53: 
 54: ## Creating an Example
 55: 
 56: Creating a `dspy.Example` is straightforward. You can initialize it with keyword arguments, where the argument names match the fields you care about (usually your Signature fields).
 57: 
 58: ```python
 59: import dspy
 60: 
 61: # Create an example for our translation task
 62: example1 = dspy.Example(
 63:     english_sentence="Hello, world!",
 64:     french_sentence="Bonjour le monde!"
 65: )
 66: 
 67: # You can access the values like attributes
 68: print(f"English: {example1.english_sentence}")
 69: print(f"French: {example1.french_sentence}")
 70: ```
 71: 
 72: **Output:**
 73: 
 74: ```
 75: English: Hello, world!
 76: French: Bonjour le monde!
 77: ```
 78: 
 79: See? `example1` now holds one complete data point for our translation task. It bundles the input (`english_sentence`) and the corresponding desired output (`french_sentence`) together.
 80: 
 81: You can also create examples from dictionaries:
 82: 
 83: ```python
 84: data_dict = {
 85:     "english_sentence": "How are you?",
 86:     "french_sentence": "Comment ça va?"
 87: }
 88: example2 = dspy.Example(data_dict)
 89: 
 90: print(f"Example 2 English: {example2.english_sentence}")
 91: ```
 92: 
 93: **Output:**
 94: 
 95: ```
 96: Example 2 English: How are you?
 97: ```
 98: 
 99: ## Why Use Examples? The Three Main Roles
100: 
101: `Example` objects are the standard way DSPy handles data, and they are used in three critical ways:
102: 
103: 1.  **Few-Shot Demonstrations:** When using modules like `dspy.Predict` (which we'll see in [Chapter 4: Predict](04_predict.md)), you can provide a few `Example` objects directly in the prompt sent to the Language Model (LM). This shows the LM *exactly* how to perform the task, often leading to much better results than instructions alone. It's like showing the chef pictures of the final dish alongside the recipe.
104: 
105: 2.  **Training Data:** When you want to *optimize* your DSPy program (e.g., automatically find the best prompts or few-shot examples), you use **Teleprompters** ([Chapter 8: Teleprompter / Optimizer](08_teleprompter___optimizer.md)). Teleprompters require a training set, which is simply a list of `dspy.Example` objects representing the tasks you want your program to learn to do well.
106: 
107: 3.  **Evaluation Data:** How do you know if your DSPy program is working correctly? You test it on a dataset! The `dspy.evaluate` module ([Chapter 7: Evaluate](07_evaluate.md)) takes a list of `dspy.Example` objects (your test set or development set) and measures your program's performance against the expected outputs (labels) in those examples.
108: 
109: In all these cases, `dspy.Example` provides a consistent way to package and manage your data points.
110: 
111: ## Marking Inputs: `.with_inputs()`
112: 
113: Often, especially during training and evaluation, DSPy needs to know which fields in your `Example` represent the *inputs* to your program and which represent the *outputs* or *labels* (the ground truth answers).
114: 
115: The `.with_inputs()` method allows you to explicitly mark certain keys as input fields. This method returns a *new* `Example` object with this input information attached, leaving the original unchanged.
116: 
117: Let's mark `english_sentence` as the input for our `example1`:
118: 
119: ```python
120: # Our original example
121: example1 = dspy.Example(
122:     english_sentence="Hello, world!",
123:     french_sentence="Bonjour le monde!"
124: )
125: 
126: # Mark 'english_sentence' as the input field
127: input_marked_example = example1.with_inputs("english_sentence")
128: 
129: # Let's check the inputs and labels (non-inputs)
130: print(f"Inputs: {input_marked_example.inputs()}")
131: print(f"Labels: {input_marked_example.labels()}")
132: ```
133: 
134: **Output:**
135: 
136: ```
137: Inputs: Example({'english_sentence': 'Hello, world!'}) (input_keys={'english_sentence'})
138: Labels: Example({'french_sentence': 'Bonjour le monde!'}) (input_keys=set())
139: ```
140: 
141: Notice:
142: *   `.with_inputs("english_sentence")` didn't change `example1`. It created `input_marked_example`.
143: *   `input_marked_example.inputs()` returns a new `Example` containing only the fields marked as inputs.
144: *   `input_marked_example.labels()` returns a new `Example` containing the remaining fields (the outputs/labels).
145: 
146: This distinction is vital for evaluation (comparing predictions against labels) and optimization (knowing what the program receives vs. what it should produce). Datasets loaded within DSPy often automatically handle marking inputs for you based on common conventions.
147: 
148: ## How It Works Under the Hood (A Peek)
149: 
150: The `dspy.Example` object is fundamentally quite simple. It's designed to behave much like a Python dictionary but with some added conveniences like attribute-style access (`example.field`) and the special `.with_inputs()` method.
151: 
152: 1.  **Storage:** Internally, an `Example` uses a dictionary (often named `_store`) to hold all the key-value pairs you provide.
153:     ```python
154:     # Conceptual internal structure
155:     example = dspy.Example(question="What is DSPy?", answer="A framework...")
156:     # example._store == {'question': 'What is DSPy?', 'answer': 'A framework...'}
157:     ```
158: 2.  **Attribute Access:** When you access `example.question`, Python's magic methods (`__getattr__`) look up `'question'` in the internal `_store`. Similarly, setting `example.new_field = value` uses `__setattr__` to update the `_store`.
159: 3.  **`.with_inputs()`:** This method creates a *copy* of the current `Example`'s `_store`. It then stores the provided input keys (like `{'english_sentence'}`) in a separate internal attribute (like `_input_keys`) on the *new* copied object. It doesn't modify the original `Example`.
160: 4.  **`.inputs()` and `.labels()`:** These methods check the `_input_keys` attribute. `.inputs()` creates a new `Example` containing only the key-value pairs whose keys are *in* `_input_keys`. `.labels()` creates a new `Example` containing the key-value pairs whose keys are *not* in `_input_keys`.
161: 
162: Let's look at a simplified view of the code from `dspy/primitives/example.py`:
163: 
164: ```python
165: # Simplified view from dspy/primitives/example.py
166: 
167: class Example:
168:     def __init__(self, base=None, **kwargs):
169:         self._store = {}  # The internal dictionary
170:         self._input_keys = None # Stores the input keys after with_inputs()
171: 
172:         # Simplified: Copy from base or dictionary if provided
173:         if base and isinstance(base, dict): self._store = base.copy()
174:         # Simplified: Update with keyword arguments
175:         self._store.update(kwargs)
176: 
177:     # Allows accessing self.key like dictionary lookup self._store[key]
178:     def __getattr__(self, key):
179:         if key in self._store: return self._store[key]
180:         raise AttributeError(f"No attribute '{key}'")
181: 
182:     # Allows setting self.key like dictionary assignment self._store[key] = value
183:     def __setattr__(self, key, value):
184:         if key.startswith("_"): super().__setattr__(key, value) # Handle internal attributes
185:         else: self._store[key] = value
186: 
187:     # Allows dictionary-style access example[key]
188:     def __getitem__(self, key): return self._store[key]
189: 
190:     # Creates a *copy* and marks input keys on the copy.
191:     def with_inputs(self, *keys):
192:         copied = self.copy() # Make a shallow copy
193:         copied._input_keys = set(keys) # Store the input keys on the copy
194:         return copied
195: 
196:     # Returns a new Example containing only input fields.
197:     def inputs(self):
198:         if self._input_keys is None: raise ValueError("Inputs not set.")
199:         # Create a dict with only input keys
200:         input_dict = {k: v for k, v in self._store.items() if k in self._input_keys}
201:         # Return a new Example wrapping this dict
202:         return type(self)(base=input_dict).with_inputs(*self._input_keys)
203: 
204:     # Returns a new Example containing only non-input fields (labels).
205:     def labels(self):
206:         input_keys = self.inputs().keys() if self._input_keys else set()
207:         # Create a dict with only non-input keys
208:         label_dict = {k: v for k, v in self._store.items() if k not in input_keys}
209:         # Return a new Example wrapping this dict
210:         return type(self)(base=label_dict)
211: 
212:     # Helper to create a copy
213:     def copy(self, **kwargs):
214:         return type(self)(base=self, **kwargs)
215: 
216:     # ... other helpful methods like keys(), values(), items(), etc. ...
217: ```
218: 
219: The key idea is that `dspy.Example` provides a convenient and standardized wrapper around your data points, making it easy to use them for few-shot examples, training, and evaluation, while also allowing you to specify which parts are inputs versus labels.
220: 
221: ## Conclusion
222: 
223: You've now mastered `dspy.Example`, the way DSPy represents individual data points!
224: 
225: *   An `Example` holds key-value pairs, like a **row in a spreadsheet** or a **flashcard**.
226: *   Its keys typically correspond to the fields defined in a [Signature](02_signature.md).
227: *   `Example`s are essential for providing **few-shot demonstrations**, **training data** for optimizers ([Teleprompter / Optimizer](08_teleprompter___optimizer.md)), and **evaluation data** for testing ([Evaluate](07_evaluate.md)).
228: *   The `.with_inputs()` method lets you mark which fields are inputs, crucial for distinguishing inputs from labels.
229: 
230: Now that we have `Signatures` to define *what* task to do, and `Examples` to hold the *data* for that task, how do we actually get a Language Model to *do* the task based on the signature? That's the job of the `dspy.Predict` module!

  8: # Chapter 4: Predict - The Basic LM Caller
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 3: Example](03_example.md), we learned how to create `dspy.Example` objects to represent our data points – like flashcards holding an input and its corresponding desired output. We also saw in [Chapter 2: Signature](02_signature.md) how to define the *task* itself using `dspy.Signature`.
 11: 
 12: Now, we have the recipe (`Signature`) and some sample dishes (`Example`s). How do we actually get the chef (our Language Model or LM) to cook? How do we combine the instructions from the `Signature` and maybe some `Example`s to prompt the LM and get a result back?
 13: 
 14: This is where **`dspy.Predict`** comes in! It's the most fundamental way in DSPy to make a single call to a Language Model.
 15: 
 16: Think of `dspy.Predict` as:
 17: 
 18: *   **A Basic Request:** Like asking the LM to do *one specific thing* based on instructions.
 19: *   **The Workhorse:** It handles formatting the input, calling the LM, and extracting the answer.
 20: *   **A Single Lego Brick:** It's the simplest "thinking" block in DSPy, directly using the LM's power.
 21: 
 22: In this chapter, we'll learn:
 23: 
 24: *   What `dspy.Predict` does.
 25: *   How to use it with a `Signature`.
 26: *   How it turns your instructions and data into an LM call.
 27: *   How to get the generated output.
 28: 
 29: Let's make our first LM call!
 30: 
 31: ## What is `dspy.Predict`?
 32: 
 33: `dspy.Predict` is a DSPy [Module](01_module___program.md). Its job is simple but essential:
 34: 
 35: 1.  **Takes a `Signature`:** When you create a `dspy.Predict` module, you tell it which `Signature` to use. This tells `Predict` what inputs to expect, what outputs to produce, and the instructions for the LM.
 36: 2.  **Receives Inputs:** When you call the `Predict` module, you provide the input data (matching the `Signature`'s input fields).
 37: 3.  **Formats a Prompt:** It combines the `Signature`'s instructions, the input data you provided, and potentially some `Example`s (called demonstrations or "demos") into a text prompt suitable for an LM.
 38: 4.  **Calls the LM:** It sends this carefully crafted prompt to the configured Language Model ([Chapter 5: LM (Language Model Client)](05_lm__language_model_client_.md)).
 39: 5.  **Parses the Output:** It takes the LM's generated text response and tries to extract the specific pieces of information defined by the `Signature`'s output fields.
 40: 6.  **Returns a `Prediction`:** It gives you back a structured object (a `dspy.Prediction`) containing the extracted output fields.
 41: 
 42: It's the core mechanism for executing a single, defined prediction task using an LM.
 43: 
 44: ## Using `dspy.Predict`
 45: 
 46: Let's use our `TranslateToFrench` signature from Chapter 2 to see `dspy.Predict` in action.
 47: 
 48: **1. Define the Signature (Recap):**
 49: 
 50: ```python
 51: import dspy
 52: from dspy.signatures.field import InputField, OutputField
 53: 
 54: class TranslateToFrench(dspy.Signature):
 55:     """Translates English text to French."""
 56:     english_sentence = dspy.InputField(desc="The original sentence in English")
 57:     french_sentence = dspy.OutputField(desc="The translated sentence in French")
 58: ```
 59: 
 60: This signature tells our module it needs `english_sentence` and should produce `french_sentence`, following the instruction "Translates English text to French."
 61: 
 62: **2. Configure the Language Model (A Sneak Peek):**
 63: 
 64: Before using `Predict`, DSPy needs to know *which* LM to talk to (like OpenAI's GPT-3.5, a local model, etc.). We'll cover this fully in [Chapter 5: LM (Language Model Client)](05_lm__language_model_client_.md), but here's a quick example:
 65: 
 66: ```python
 67: # Assume you have an OpenAI API key configured
 68: # We'll explain this properly in the next chapter!
 69: gpt3_turbo = dspy.OpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo')
 70: dspy.settings.configure(lm=gpt3_turbo)
 71: ```
 72: 
 73: This tells DSPy to use the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model for any LM calls.
 74: 
 75: **3. Create and Use `dspy.Predict`:**
 76: 
 77: Now we can create our translator module using `dspy.Predict` and our signature.
 78: 
 79: ```python
 80: # Create a Predict module using our signature
 81: translator = dspy.Predict(TranslateToFrench)
 82: 
 83: # Prepare the input data
 84: english_input = "Hello, how are you?"
 85: 
 86: # Call the predictor with the input field name from the signature
 87: result = translator(english_sentence=english_input)
 88: 
 89: # Access the output field name from the signature
 90: print(f"English: {english_input}")
 91: print(f"French: {result.french_sentence}")
 92: ```
 93: 
 94: **What happens here?**
 95: 
 96: 1.  `translator = dspy.Predict(TranslateToFrench)`: We create an instance of `Predict`, telling it to use the `TranslateToFrench` signature.
 97: 2.  `result = translator(english_sentence=english_input)`: We *call* the `translator` module like a function. We pass the input using the keyword argument `english_sentence`, which matches the `InputField` name in our signature.
 98: 3.  `result.french_sentence`: `Predict` works its magic! It builds a prompt (using the signature's instructions and the input), sends it to GPT-3.5 Turbo, gets the French translation back, parses it, and stores it in the `result` object. We access the translation using the `OutputField` name, `french_sentence`.
 99: 
100: **Expected Output (might vary slightly based on the LM):**
101: 
102: ```
103: English: Hello, how are you?
104: French: Bonjour, comment ça va?
105: ```
106: 
107: It worked! `dspy.Predict` successfully used the LM to perform the translation task defined by our signature.
108: 
109: ## Giving Examples (Few-Shot Learning)
110: 
111: Sometimes, just instructions aren't enough for the LM to understand the *exact format* or style you want. You can provide a few examples (`dspy.Example` objects from [Chapter 3: Example](03_example.md)) to guide it better. This is called "few-shot learning".
112: 
113: You pass these examples using the `demos` argument when calling the `Predict` module.
114: 
115: ```python
116: # Create some example translations (from Chapter 3)
117: demo1 = dspy.Example(english_sentence="Good morning!", french_sentence="Bonjour!")
118: demo2 = dspy.Example(english_sentence="Thank you.", french_sentence="Merci.")
119: 
120: # Our translator module (same as before)
121: translator = dspy.Predict(TranslateToFrench)
122: 
123: # Input we want to translate
124: english_input = "See you later."
125: 
126: # Call the predictor, this time providing demos
127: result_with_demos = translator(
128:     english_sentence=english_input,
129:     demos=[demo1, demo2] # Pass our examples here!
130: )
131: 
132: print(f"English: {english_input}")
133: print(f"French (with demos): {result_with_demos.french_sentence}")
134: ```
135: 
136: **What's different?**
137: 
138: *   We created `demo1` and `demo2`, which are `dspy.Example` objects containing both the English and French sentences.
139: *   We passed `demos=[demo1, demo2]` when calling `translator`.
140: 
141: Now, `dspy.Predict` will format the prompt to include these examples *before* asking the LM to translate the new input. This often leads to more accurate or better-formatted results, especially for complex tasks.
142: 
143: **Expected Output (likely similar, but potentially more consistent):**
144: 
145: ```
146: English: See you later.
147: French (with demos): À plus tard.
148: ```
149: 
150: ## How It Works Under the Hood
151: 
152: What actually happens when you call `translator(english_sentence=...)`?
153: 
154: 1.  **Gather Information:** The `Predict` module (`translator`) gets the input value (`"Hello, how are you?"`) and any `demos` provided. It already knows its `Signature` (`TranslateToFrench`).
155: 2.  **Format Prompt:** It constructs a text prompt for the LM. This prompt usually includes:
156:     *   The `Signature`'s instructions (`"Translates English text to French."`).
157:     *   The `demos` (if provided), formatted clearly (e.g., "English: Good morning!\nFrench: Bonjour!\n---\nEnglish: Thank you.\nFrench: Merci.\n---").
158:     *   The current input, labeled according to the `Signature` (`"English: Hello, how are you?"`).
159:     *   A label indicating where the LM should put its answer (`"French:"`).
160: 3.  **LM Call:** The `Predict` module sends this complete prompt string to the configured [LM](05_lm__language_model_client_.md) (e.g., GPT-3.5 Turbo).
161: 4.  **Receive Completion:** The LM generates text based on the prompt (e.g., it might return `"Bonjour, comment ça va?"`).
162: 5.  **Parse Output:** `Predict` looks at the `Signature`'s `OutputField`s (`french_sentence`). It parses the LM's completion to extract the value corresponding to `french_sentence`.
163: 6.  **Return Prediction:** It bundles the extracted output(s) into a `dspy.Prediction` object and returns it. You can then access the results like `result.french_sentence`.
164: 
165: Let's visualize this flow:

183: ```
184: 
185: The core logic resides in `dspy/predict/predict.py`.
186: 
187: ```python
188: # Simplified view from dspy/predict/predict.py
189: 
190: from dspy.primitives.program import Module
191: from dspy.primitives.prediction import Prediction
192: from dspy.signatures.signature import ensure_signature
193: from dspy.dsp.utils import settings # To get the configured LM
194: 
195: class Predict(Module):
196:     def __init__(self, signature, **config):
197:         super().__init__()
198:         # Store the signature and any extra configuration
199:         self.signature = ensure_signature(signature)
200:         self.config = config
201:         # Other initializations (demos, etc.)
202:         self.demos = []
203:         self.lm = None # LM will be set later or taken from settings
204: 
205:     def forward(self, **kwargs):
206:         # Get signature, demos, and LM (either passed in or from settings)
207:         signature = self.signature # Use the stored signature
208:         demos = kwargs.pop("demos", self.demos) # Get demos if provided
209:         lm = kwargs.pop("lm", self.lm) or settings.lm # Find the LM to use
210: 
211:         # Prepare inputs for the LM call
212:         inputs = kwargs # Remaining kwargs are the inputs
213: 
214:         # --- This is where the magic happens ---
215:         # 1. Format the prompt using signature, demos, inputs
216:         #    (Simplified - actual formatting is more complex)
217:         prompt = format_prompt(signature, demos, inputs)
218: 
219:         # 2. Call the Language Model
220:         #    (Simplified - handles retries, multiple generations etc.)
221:         lm_output_text = lm(prompt, **self.config)
222: 
223:         # 3. Parse the LM's output text based on the signature's output fields
224:         #    (Simplified - extracts fields like 'french_sentence')
225:         parsed_output = parse_output(signature, lm_output_text)
226:         # --- End Magic ---
227: 
228:         # 4. Create and return a Prediction object
229:         prediction = Prediction(signature=signature, **parsed_output)
230:         # (Optionally trace the call)
231:         # settings.trace.append(...)
232: 
233:         return prediction
234: 
235: # (Helper functions format_prompt and parse_output would exist elsewhere)
236: ```
237: 
238: This simplified code shows the key steps: initialize with a signature, and in the `forward` method, use the signature, demos, and inputs to format a prompt, call the LM, parse the output, and return a `Prediction`. The `dspy.Prediction` object itself (defined in `dspy/primitives/prediction.py`) is essentially a specialized container holding the results corresponding to the signature's output fields.
239: 
240: ## Conclusion
241: 
242: You've now learned about `dspy.Predict`, the fundamental building block in DSPy for making a single call to a Language Model!
243: 
244: *   `dspy.Predict` takes a `Signature` to understand the task (inputs, outputs, instructions).
245: *   It formats a prompt, calls the LM, and parses the response.
246: *   You call it like a function, passing inputs that match the `Signature`'s `InputField`s.
247: *   It returns a `dspy.Prediction` object containing the results, accessible via the `Signature`'s `OutputField` names.
248: *   You can provide few-shot `Example`s via the `demos` argument to guide the LM.
249: 
250: `Predict` is the simplest way to leverage an LM in DSPy. But how do we actually connect DSPy to different LMs like those from OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, or even models running on your own machine? That's what we'll explore next!

  8: # Chapter 5: LM (Language Model Client) - The Engine Room
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 4: Predict](04_predict.md), we saw how `dspy.Predict` takes a [Signature](02_signature.md) and input data to magically generate an output. We used our `translator` example:
 11: 
 12: ```python
 13: # translator = dspy.Predict(TranslateToFrench)
 14: # result = translator(english_sentence="Hello, how are you?")
 15: # print(result.french_sentence) # --> Bonjour, comment ça va?
 16: ```
 17: 
 18: But wait... how did `dspy.Predict` *actually* produce that French sentence? It didn't just invent it! It needed to talk to a powerful Language Model (LM) like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, Llama, or some other AI brain.
 19: 
 20: How does DSPy connect your program (`dspy.Predict` in this case) to these external AI brains? That's the job of the **LM (Language Model Client)** abstraction!
 21: 
 22: Think of the LM Client as:
 23: 
 24: *   **The Engine:** It's the core component that provides the "thinking" power to your DSPy modules.
 25: *   **The Translator:** It speaks the specific language (API calls, parameters) required by different LM providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, or models running locally).
 26: *   **The Connection:** It bridges the gap between your abstract DSPy code and the concrete LM service.
 27: 
 28: In this chapter, you'll learn:
 29: 
 30: *   What the LM Client does and why it's crucial.
 31: *   How to tell DSPy which Language Model to use.
 32: *   How this setup lets you easily switch between different LMs.
 33: *   A peek under the hood at how the connection works.
 34: 
 35: Let's connect our program to an AI brain!
 36: 
 37: ## What Does the LM Client Do?
 38: 
 39: When a module like `dspy.Predict` needs an LM to generate text, it doesn't make the raw API call itself. Instead, it relies on the configured **LM Client**. The LM Client handles several important tasks:
 40: 
 41: 1.  **API Interaction:** It knows how to format the request (the prompt, parameters like `temperature`, `max_tokens`) in the exact way the target LM provider expects. It then makes the actual network call to the provider's API (or interacts with a local model).
 42: 2.  **Parameter Management:** You can set standard parameters like `temperature` (controlling randomness) or `max_tokens` (limiting output length) when you configure the LM Client. It ensures these are sent correctly with each request.
 43: 3.  **Authentication:** It usually handles sending your API keys securely (often by reading them from environment variables).
 44: 4.  **Retries:** If an API call fails due to a temporary issue (like a network glitch or the LM service being busy), the LM Client often automatically retries the request a few times.
 45: 5.  **Standard Interface:** It provides a consistent way for DSPy modules (`Predict`, `ChainOfThought`, etc.) to interact with *any* supported LM. This means you can swap the underlying LM without changing your module code.
 46: 6.  **Caching:** To save time and money, the LM Client usually caches responses. If you make the exact same request again, it can return the saved result instantly instead of calling the LM API again.
 47: 
 48: Essentially, the LM Client abstracts away all the messy details of talking to different AI models, giving your DSPy program a clean and consistent engine to rely on.
 49: 
 50: ## Configuring Which LM to Use
 51: 
 52: So, how do you tell DSPy *which* LM engine to use? You do this using `dspy.settings.configure`.
 53: 
 54: First, you need to import and create an instance of the specific client for your desired LM provider. DSPy integrates with many models primarily through the `litellm` library, but also provides direct wrappers for common ones like OpenAI.
 55: 
 56: **Example: Configuring OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo**
 57: 
 58: Let's say you want to use OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.
 59: 
 60: 1.  **Import the client:**
 61:     ```python
 62:     import dspy
 63:     ```
 64:     *(Note: For many common providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc., you can use the general `dspy.LM` client which leverages `litellm`)*
 65: 
 66: 2.  **Create an instance:** You specify the model name. API keys are typically picked up automatically from environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`). You can also set default parameters here.
 67: 
 68:     ```python
 69:     # Use the generic dspy.LM for LiteLLM integration
 70:     # Model name follows 'provider/model_name' format for many models
 71:     turbo = dspy.LM(model='openai/gpt-3.5-turbo', max_tokens=100)
 72: 
 73:     # Or, if you prefer the dedicated OpenAI client wrapper (functionally similar for basic use)
 74:     # from dspy.models.openai import OpenAI
 75:     # turbo = OpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo', max_tokens=100)
 76:     ```
 77:     This creates an object `turbo` that knows how to talk to the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model via OpenAI's API (using `litellm`'s connection logic) and will limit responses to 100 tokens by default.
 78: 
 79: 3.  **Configure DSPy settings:** You tell DSPy globally that this is the LM engine to use for subsequent calls.
 80: 
 81:     ```python
 82:     dspy.settings.configure(lm=turbo)
 83:     ```
 84:     That's it! Now, any DSPy module (like `dspy.Predict`) that needs to call an LM will automatically use the `turbo` instance we just configured.
 85: 
 86: **Using Other Models (via `dspy.LM` and LiteLLM)**
 87: 
 88: The `dspy.LM` client is very powerful because it uses `litellm` under the hood, which supports a vast numberk of models from providers like Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Hugging Face, Ollama (for local models), and more. You generally just need to change the `model` string.
 89: 
 90: ```python
 91: # Example: Configure Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku
 92: # (Assumes ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is set)
 93: # Note: Provider prefix 'anthropic/' is often optional if model name is unique
 94: claude_haiku = dspy.LM(model='anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307', max_tokens=200)
 95: dspy.settings.configure(lm=claude_haiku)
 96: 
 97: # Now DSPy modules will use Claude 3 Haiku
 98: 
 99: # Example: Configure a local model served via Ollama
100: # (Assumes Ollama server is running and has the 'llama3' model)
101: local_llama = dspy.LM(model='ollama/llama3', max_tokens=500, temperature=0.7)
102: dspy.settings.configure(lm=local_llama)
103: 
104: # Now DSPy modules will use the local Llama 3 model via Ollama
105: ```
106: 
107: You only need to configure the LM **once** (usually at the start of your script).
108: 
109: ## How Modules Use the Configured LM
110: 
111: Remember our `translator` module from [Chapter 4: Predict](04_predict.md)?
112: 
113: ```python
114: # Define signature (same as before)
115: class TranslateToFrench(dspy.Signature):
116:     """Translates English text to French."""
117:     english_sentence = dspy.InputField()
118:     french_sentence = dspy.OutputField()
119: 
120: # Configure the LM (e.g., using OpenAI)
121: # turbo = dspy.LM(model='openai/gpt-3.5-turbo', max_tokens=100)
122: # dspy.settings.configure(lm=turbo)
123: 
124: # Create the Predict module
125: translator = dspy.Predict(TranslateToFrench)
126: 
127: # Use the module - NO need to pass the LM here!
128: result = translator(english_sentence="Hello, how are you?")
129: print(result.french_sentence)
130: ```
131: 
132: Notice that we didn't pass `turbo` or `claude_haiku` or `local_llama` directly to `dspy.Predict`. When `translator(...)` is called, `dspy.Predict` internally asks `dspy.settings` for the currently configured `lm`. It then uses that client object to handle the actual LM interaction.
133: 
134: ## The Power of Swapping LMs
135: 
136: This setup makes it incredibly easy to experiment with different language models. Want to see if Claude does a better job at translation than GPT-3.5? Just change the configuration!
137: 
138: ```python
139: # --- Experiment 1: Using GPT-3.5 Turbo ---
140: print("Testing with GPT-3.5 Turbo...")
141: turbo = dspy.LM(model='openai/gpt-3.5-turbo', max_tokens=100)
142: dspy.settings.configure(lm=turbo)
143: 
144: translator = dspy.Predict(TranslateToFrench)
145: result_turbo = translator(english_sentence="Where is the library?")
146: print(f"GPT-3.5: {result_turbo.french_sentence}")
147: 
148: 
149: # --- Experiment 2: Using Claude 3 Haiku ---
150: print("\nTesting with Claude 3 Haiku...")
151: claude_haiku = dspy.LM(model='anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307', max_tokens=100)
152: dspy.settings.configure(lm=claude_haiku)
153: 
154: # We can reuse the SAME translator object, or create a new one
155: # It will pick up the NEWLY configured LM from settings
156: result_claude = translator(english_sentence="Where is the library?")
157: print(f"Claude 3 Haiku: {result_claude.french_sentence}")
158: ```
159: 
160: **Expected Output:**
161: 
162: ```
163: Testing with GPT-3.5 Turbo...
164: GPT-3.5: Où est la bibliothèque?
165: 
166: Testing with Claude 3 Haiku...
167: Claude 3 Haiku: Où se trouve la bibliothèque ?
168: ```
169: 
170: Look at that! We changed the underlying AI brain just by modifying the `dspy.settings.configure` call. The core logic of our `translator` module remained untouched. This flexibility is a key advantage of DSPy.
171: 
172: ## How It Works Under the Hood (A Peek)
173: 
174: Let's trace what happens when `translator(english_sentence=...)` runs:
175: 
176: 1.  **Module Execution:** The `forward` method of the `dspy.Predict` module (`translator`) starts executing.
177: 2.  **Get LM Client:** Inside its logic, `Predict` needs to call an LM. It accesses `dspy.settings.lm`. This returns the currently configured LM client object (e.g., the `claude_haiku` instance we set).
178: 3.  **Format Prompt:** `Predict` uses the [Signature](02_signature.md) and the input (`english_sentence`) to prepare the text prompt.
179: 4.  **LM Client Call:** `Predict` calls the LM client object, passing the formatted prompt and any necessary parameters (like `max_tokens` which might come from the client's defaults or be overridden). Let's say it calls `claude_haiku(prompt, max_tokens=100, ...)`.
180: 5.  **API Interaction (Inside LM Client):**
181:     *   The `claude_haiku` object (an instance of `dspy.LM`) checks its cache first. If the same request was made recently, it might return the cached response directly.
182:     *   If not cached, it constructs the specific API request for Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku model (using `litellm`). This includes setting headers, API keys, and formatting the prompt/parameters correctly for Anthropic.
183:     *   It makes the HTTPS request to the Anthropic API endpoint.
184:     *   It handles potential retries if the API returns specific errors.
185:     *   It receives the raw response from the API.
186: 6.  **Parse Response (Inside LM Client):** The client extracts the generated text content from the API response structure.
187: 7.  **Return to Module:** The LM client returns the generated text (e.g., `"Où se trouve la bibliothèque ?"`) back to the `dspy.Predict` module.
188: 8.  **Module Finishes:** `Predict` takes this text, parses it according to the `OutputField` (`french_sentence`) in the signature, and returns the final `Prediction` object.

214: **Relevant Code Files:**
215: 
216: *   `dspy/clients/lm.py`: Defines the main `dspy.LM` class which uses `litellm` for broad compatibility. It handles caching (in-memory and disk via `litellm`), retries, parameter mapping, and calling the appropriate `litellm` functions.
217: *   `dspy/clients/base_lm.py`: Defines the `BaseLM` abstract base class that all LM clients inherit from. It includes the basic `__call__` structure, history tracking, and requires subclasses to implement the core `forward` method for making the actual API call. It also defines `inspect_history`.
218: *   `dspy/models/openai.py` (and others like `anthropic.py`, `cohere.py` - though `dspy.LM` is often preferred now): Specific client implementations (often inheriting from `BaseLM` or using `dspy.LM` internally).
219: *   `dspy/dsp/utils/settings.py`: Defines the `Settings` singleton object where the configured `lm` (and other components like `rm`) are stored and accessed globally or via thread-local context.

280: 
281: # Simplified Usage in a Module (like Predict)

290: # parsed_result = self._parse_output(output_text) # Parse based on signature
291: # return Prediction(**parsed_result)
292: ```
293: 
294: The key is that modules interact with the standard `BaseLM` interface (primarily its `__call__` method), and the specific LM client implementation handles the rest.
295: 
296: ## Conclusion
297: 
298: You've now demystified the **LM (Language Model Client)**! It's the essential engine connecting your DSPy programs to the power of large language models.
299: 
300: *   The LM Client acts as a **translator** and **engine**, handling API calls, parameters, retries, and caching.
301: *   You configure which LM to use **globally** via `dspy.settings.configure(lm=...)`, usually using `dspy.LM` for broad compatibility via `litellm`.
302: *   DSPy modules like `dspy.Predict` automatically **use the configured LM** without needing it passed explicitly.
303: *   This makes it easy to **swap out different LMs** (like GPT-4, Claude, Llama) with minimal code changes, facilitating experimentation.
304: 
305: Now that we know how to connect to the "brain" (LM), what about connecting to external knowledge sources like databases or document collections? That's where the **RM (Retrieval Model Client)** comes in.

  8: # Chapter 6: RM (Retrieval Model Client) - Your Program's Librarian
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 5: LM (Language Model Client)](05_lm__language_model_client_.md), we learned how to connect our DSPy programs to the powerful "brain" of a Language Model (LM) using the LM Client. The LM is great at generating creative text, answering questions based on its vast training data, and reasoning.
 11: 
 12: But what if your program needs information that the LM wasn't trained on?
 13: *   Maybe it's very recent news (LMs often have knowledge cut-offs).
 14: *   Maybe it's private information from your company's documents.
 15: *   Maybe it's specific details from a large technical manual.
 16: 
 17: LMs can't know *everything*. Sometimes, your program needs to **look things up** in an external knowledge source before it can generate an answer.
 18: 
 19: Imagine you're building a chatbot that answers questions about your company's latest product manuals. The LM itself probably hasn't read them. Your program needs a way to:
 20: 1.  Receive the user's question (e.g., "How do I reset the Frobozz device?").
 21: 2.  **Search** through the product manuals for relevant sections about resetting the Frobozz.
 22: 3.  Give those relevant sections to the LM as **context**.
 23: 4.  Ask the LM to generate a final answer based on the user's question *and* the context it just found.
 24: 
 25: This "search" step is where the **RM (Retrieval Model Client)** comes in!
 26: 
 27: Think of the RM as:
 28: 
 29: *   **A Specialized Librarian:** Your program asks it to find relevant information on a topic (the query).
 30: *   **A Search Engine Interface:** It connects your DSPy program to an external search system or database.
 31: *   **The Knowledge Fetcher:** It retrieves relevant text snippets (passages) to help the LM.
 32: 
 33: In this chapter, you'll learn:
 34: 
 35: *   What an RM Client does and why it's essential for knowledge-intensive tasks.
 36: *   How to configure DSPy to use a specific Retrieval Model.
 37: *   How DSPy modules can use the configured RM to find information.
 38: *   A glimpse into how the RM fetches data behind the scenes.
 39: 
 40: Let's give our program access to external knowledge!
 41: 
 42: ## What Does the RM Client Do?
 43: 
 44: The RM Client acts as a bridge between your DSPy program and an external knowledge source. Its main job is to:
 45: 
 46: 1.  **Receive a Search Query:** Your program gives it a text query (e.g., "reset Frobozz device").
 47: 2.  **Interface with a Retrieval System:** It talks to the actual search engine or database. This could be:
 48:     *   A **Vector Database:** Like Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, Milvus (great for searching based on meaning).
 49:     *   A **Specialized Retrieval API:** Like ColBERTv2 (a powerful neural search model), You.com Search API, or a custom company search API.
 50:     *   A **Local Index:** A search index built over your own files (e.g., using ColBERT locally).
 51: 3.  **Fetch Relevant Passages:** It asks the retrieval system to find the top `k` most relevant text documents or passages based on the query.
 52: 4.  **Return the Passages:** It gives these retrieved passages back to your DSPy program, usually as a list of text strings or structured objects.
 53: 
 54: The key goal is to provide **relevant context** that the [LM (Language Model Client)](05_lm__language_model_client_.md) can then use to perform its task more accurately, often within a structure called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
 55: 
 56: ## Configuring Which RM to Use
 57: 
 58: Just like we configured the LM in the previous chapter, we need to tell DSPy which RM to use. This is done using `dspy.settings.configure`.
 59: 
 60: First, you import and create an instance of the specific RM client you want to use. DSPy has built-in clients for several common retrieval systems.
 61: 
 62: **Example: Configuring ColBERTv2 (a hosted endpoint)**
 63: 
 64: ColBERTv2 is a powerful retrieval model. Let's imagine there's a public server running ColBERTv2 that has indexed Wikipedia.
 65: 
 66: 1.  **Import the client:**
 67:     ```python
 68:     import dspy
 69:     ```
 70:     *(For many RMs like ColBERTv2, Pinecone, Weaviate, the client is directly available under `dspy` or `dspy.retrieve`)*
 71: 
 72: 2.  **Create an instance:** You need to provide the URL and port (if applicable) of the ColBERTv2 server.
 73: 
 74:     ```python
 75:     # Assume a ColBERTv2 server is running at this URL indexing Wikipedia
 76:     colbertv2_wiki = dspy.ColBERTv2(url='http://your-colbertv2-endpoint.com:8893', port=None)
 77:     ```
 78:     This creates an object `colbertv2_wiki` that knows how to talk to that specific ColBERTv2 server.
 79: 
 80: 3.  **Configure DSPy settings:** Tell DSPy globally that this is the RM to use.
 81: 
 82:     ```python
 83:     dspy.settings.configure(rm=colbertv2_wiki)
 84:     ```
 85:     Now, any DSPy module that needs to retrieve information will automatically use the `colbertv2_wiki` instance.
 86: 
 87: **Using Other RMs (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate)**
 88: 
 89: Configuring other RMs follows a similar pattern. You'll typically need to provide details like index names, API keys (often via environment variables), and the client object for that specific service.
 90: 
 91: ```python
 92: # Example: Configuring Pinecone (Conceptual - requires setup)
 93: # from dspy.retrieve.pinecone_rm import PineconeRM
 94: # Assumes PINECONE_API_KEY and PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT are set in environment
 95: # pinecone_retriever = PineconeRM(
 96: #     pinecone_index_name='my-company-docs-index',
 97: #     # Assuming embeddings are done via OpenAI's model
 98: #     openai_embed_model='text-embedding-ada-002'
 99: # )
100: # dspy.settings.configure(rm=pinecone_retriever)
101: 
102: # Example: Configuring Weaviate (Conceptual - requires setup)
103: # import weaviate
104: # from dspy.retrieve.weaviate_rm import WeaviateRM
105: # weaviate_client = weaviate.connect_to_local() # Or connect_to_wcs, etc.
106: # weaviate_retriever = WeaviateRM(
107: #     weaviate_collection_name='my_manuals',
108: #     weaviate_client=weaviate_client
109: # )
110: # dspy.settings.configure(rm=weaviate_retriever)
111: ```
112: *(Don't worry about the specifics of connecting to Pinecone or Weaviate here; the key takeaway is the `dspy.settings.configure(rm=...)` pattern.)*
113: 
114: ## How Modules Use the Configured RM: `dspy.Retrieve`
115: 
116: Usually, you don't call `dspy.settings.rm(...)` directly in your main program logic. Instead, you use a DSPy module designed for retrieval. The most basic one is `dspy.Retrieve`.
117: 
118: The `dspy.Retrieve` module is a simple [Module](01_module___program.md) whose job is to:
119: 1.  Take a query as input.
120: 2.  Call the currently configured RM (`dspy.settings.rm`).
121: 3.  Return the retrieved passages.
122: 
123: Here's how you typically use it within a DSPy `Program`:
124: 
125: ```python
126: import dspy
127: 
128: # Assume RM is already configured (e.g., colbertv2_wiki from before)
129: # dspy.settings.configure(rm=colbertv2_wiki)
130: 
131: class SimpleRAG(dspy.Module):
132:     def __init__(self, num_passages=3):
133:         super().__init__()
134:         # Initialize the Retrieve module, asking for top 3 passages
135:         self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=num_passages)
136:         # Initialize a Predict module to generate the answer
137:         self.generate_answer = dspy.Predict('context, question -> answer')
138: 
139:     def forward(self, question):
140:         # 1. Retrieve relevant context using the configured RM
141:         context = self.retrieve(query=question).passages # Note: Pass query=...
142: 
143:         # 2. Generate the answer using the LM, providing context
144:         prediction = self.generate_answer(context=context, question=question)
145:         return prediction
146: 
147: # --- Let's try it ---
148: # Assume LM is also configured (e.g., gpt3_turbo from Chapter 5)
149: # dspy.settings.configure(lm=gpt3_turbo)
150: 
151: rag_program = SimpleRAG()
152: question = "What is the largest rodent?"
153: result = rag_program(question=question)
154: 
155: print(f"Question: {question}")
156: # The retrieve module would fetch passages about rodents...
157: # print(f"Context: {context}") # (Would show passages about capybaras, etc.)
158: print(f"Answer: {result.answer}")
159: ```
160: 
161: **What's happening?**
162: 
163: 1.  `self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=3)`: Inside our `SimpleRAG` program, we create an instance of `dspy.Retrieve`. We tell it we want the top `k=3` passages.
164: 2.  `context = self.retrieve(query=question).passages`: In the `forward` method, we call the `retrieve` module with the input `question` as the `query`.
165:     *   **Crucially:** The `dspy.Retrieve` module automatically looks up `dspy.settings.rm` (our configured `colbertv2_wiki`).
166:     *   It calls `colbertv2_wiki(question, k=3)`.
167:     *   The RM client fetches the passages.
168:     *   `dspy.Retrieve` returns a `dspy.Prediction` object, and we access the list of passage texts using `.passages`.
169: 3.  `self.generate_answer(context=context, question=question)`: We then pass the fetched `context` (along with the original `question`) to our `generate_answer` module (a `dspy.Predict` instance), which uses the configured [LM](05_lm__language_model_client_.md) to produce the final answer.
170: 
171: **Expected Output (using a Wikipedia RM and a capable LM):**
172: 
173: ```
174: Question: What is the largest rodent?
175: Answer: The largest rodent is the capybara.
176: ```
177: 
178: The `dspy.Retrieve` module handles the interaction with the configured RM seamlessly.
179: 
180: ## Calling the RM Directly (for Testing)
181: 
182: While `dspy.Retrieve` is the standard way, you *can* call the configured RM directly if you want to quickly test it or see what it returns.
183: 
184: ```python
185: import dspy
186: 
187: # Assume colbertv2_wiki is configured as the RM
188: # dspy.settings.configure(rm=colbertv2_wiki)
189: 
190: query = "Stanford University mascot"
191: k = 2 # Ask for top 2 passages
192: 
193: # Call the configured RM directly
194: retrieved_passages = dspy.settings.rm(query, k=k)
195: 
196: # Print the results
197: print(f"Query: {query}")
198: print(f"Retrieved Passages (Top {k}):")
199: for i, passage in enumerate(retrieved_passages):
200:     # RM clients often return dotdict objects with 'long_text'
201:     print(f"--- Passage {i+1} ---")
202:     print(passage.long_text) # Access the text content
203: ```
204: 
205: **Expected Output (might vary depending on the RM and its index):**
206: 
207: ```
208: Query: Stanford University mascot
209: Retrieved Passages (Top 2):
210: --- Passage 1 ---
211: Stanford Tree | Stanford University Athletics The Stanford Tree is the Stanford Band's mascot and the unofficial mascot of Stanford University. Stanford's team name is "Cardinal", referring to the vivid red color (not the bird as at several other schools). The Tree, in various versions, has been called one of America's most bizarre and controversial college mascots. The tree costume is created anew by the Band member selected to be the Tree each year. The Tree appears at football games, basketball games, and other Stanford Athletic events. Any current student may petition to become the Tree for the following year....
212: --- Passage 2 ---
213: Stanford Cardinal | The Official Site of Stanford Athletics Stanford University is home to 36 varsity sports programs, 20 for women and 16 for men. Stanford participates in the NCAA's Division I (Football Bowl Subdivision subdivision for football). Stanford is a member of the Pac-12 Conference in most sports; the men's and women's water polo teams are members of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, the men's volleyball team is a member of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, the field hockey team is a member of the America East Conference, and the sailing team competes in the Pacific Coast Collegiate Sailing Conference....
214: ```
215: 
216: This shows how you can directly interact with the RM client configured in `dspy.settings`. Notice the output is often a list of `dspy.dsp.utils.dotdict` objects, where the actual text is usually in the `long_text` attribute. `dspy.Retrieve` conveniently extracts just the text into its `.passages` list.
217: 
218: ## How It Works Under the Hood
219: 
220: Let's trace the journey of a query when using `dspy.Retrieve` within our `SimpleRAG` program:
221: 
222: 1.  **Module Call:** The `SimpleRAG` program's `forward` method calls `self.retrieve(query="What is the largest rodent?")`.
223: 2.  **Get RM Client:** The `dspy.Retrieve` module (`self.retrieve`) needs an RM. It looks up `dspy.settings.rm`. This returns the configured RM client object (e.g., our `colbertv2_wiki` instance).
224: 3.  **RM Client Call:** The `Retrieve` module calls the RM client object's `forward` (or `__call__`) method, passing the query and `k` (e.g., `colbertv2_wiki("What is the largest rodent?", k=3)`).
225: 4.  **External Interaction (Inside RM Client):**
226:     *   The `colbertv2_wiki` object (an instance of `dspy.ColBERTv2`) constructs an HTTP request to the ColBERTv2 server URL (`http://your-colbertv2-endpoint.com:8893`). The request includes the query and `k`.
227:     *   It sends the request over the network.
228:     *   The external ColBERTv2 server receives the request, searches its index (e.g., Wikipedia), and finds the top 3 relevant passages.
229:     *   The server sends the passages back in the HTTP response (often as JSON).
230: 5.  **Parse Response (Inside RM Client):** The `colbertv2_wiki` client receives the response, parses the JSON, and converts the passages into a list of `dspy.dsp.utils.dotdict` objects (each containing `long_text`, potentially `pid`, `score`, etc.).
231: 6.  **Return to Module:** The RM client returns this list of `dotdict` passages back to the `dspy.Retrieve` module.
232: 7.  **Extract Text:** The `Retrieve` module takes the list of `dotdict` objects and extracts the `long_text` from each, creating a simple list of strings.
233: 8.  **Return Prediction:** It packages this list of strings into a `dspy.Prediction` object under the `passages` key and returns it to the `SimpleRAG` program.

261: **Relevant Code Files:**
262: 
263: *   `dspy/retrieve/retrieve.py`: Defines the `dspy.Retrieve` module. Its `forward` method gets the query, retrieves the RM from `dspy.settings`, calls the RM, and processes the results into a `Prediction`.
264: *   `dspy/dsp/colbertv2.py`: Defines the `dspy.ColBERTv2` client. Its `__call__` method makes HTTP requests (`requests.get` or `requests.post`) to a ColBERTv2 endpoint and parses the JSON response. (Other clients like `dspy/retrieve/pinecone_rm.py` or `dspy/retrieve/weaviate_rm.py` contain logic specific to those services).
265: *   `dspy/dsp/utils/settings.py`: Where the configured `rm` instance is stored and accessed globally (as seen in [Chapter 5: LM (Language Model Client)](05_lm__language_model_client_.md)).

333: 
334: The key idea is abstraction: `dspy.Retrieve` uses whatever RM is configured in `dspy.settings`, and the specific RM client hides the details of talking to its particular backend search system.
335: 
336: ## Conclusion
337: 
338: You've now met the **RM (Retrieval Model Client)**, your DSPy program's connection to external knowledge sources!
339: 
340: *   An RM acts like a **librarian** or **search engine interface**.
341: *   It takes a **query** and fetches **relevant text passages** from systems like vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate) or APIs (ColBERTv2).
342: *   It provides crucial **context** for LMs, enabling tasks like answering questions about recent events or private documents (Retrieval-Augmented Generation - RAG).
343: *   You configure it globally using `dspy.settings.configure(rm=...)`.
344: *   The `dspy.Retrieve` module is the standard way to use the configured RM within your programs.
345: 
346: With LMs providing reasoning and RMs providing knowledge, we can build powerful DSPy programs. But how do we know if our program is actually working well? How do we measure its performance? That's where evaluation comes in!

  8: # Chapter 7: Evaluate - Grading Your Program
  9: 
 10: In the previous chapter, [Chapter 6: RM (Retrieval Model Client)](06_rm__retrieval_model_client_.md), we learned how to connect our DSPy program to external knowledge sources using Retrieval Models (RMs). We saw how combining RMs with Language Models (LMs) allows us to build sophisticated programs like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
 11: 
 12: Now that we can build these powerful programs, a crucial question arises: **How good are they?** If we build a RAG system to answer questions, how often does it get the answer right? How do we measure its performance objectively?
 13: 
 14: This is where **`dspy.Evaluate`** comes in! It's DSPy's built-in tool for testing and grading your programs.
 15: 
 16: Think of `dspy.Evaluate` as:
 17: 
 18: *   **An Automated Grader:** Like a teacher grading a batch of homework assignments based on an answer key.
 19: *   **A Test Suite Runner:** Similar to how software developers use test suites to check if their code works correctly.
 20: *   **Your Program's Report Card:** It gives you a score that tells you how well your DSPy program is performing on a specific set of tasks.
 21: 
 22: In this chapter, you'll learn:
 23: 
 24: *   What you need to evaluate a DSPy program.
 25: *   How to define a metric (a grading rule).
 26: *   How to use `dspy.Evaluate` to run the evaluation and get a score.
 27: *   How it works behind the scenes.
 28: 
 29: Let's learn how to grade our DSPy creations!
 30: 
 31: ## The Ingredients for Evaluation
 32: 
 33: To grade your program using `dspy.Evaluate`, you need three main ingredients:
 34: 
 35: 1.  **Your DSPy `Program`:** The program you want to test. This could be a simple `dspy.Predict` module or a complex multi-step program like the `SimpleRAG` we sketched out in the last chapter.
 36: 2.  **A Dataset (`devset`):** A list of `dspy.Example` objects ([Chapter 3: Example](03_example.md)). Crucially, these examples must contain not only the **inputs** your program expects but also the **gold standard outputs** (the correct answers or desired results) that you want to compare against. This dataset is often called a "development set" or "dev set".
 37: 3.  **A Metric Function (`metric`):** A Python function you define. This function takes one gold standard `Example` and the `Prediction` generated by your program for that example's inputs. It then compares them and returns a score indicating how well the prediction matched the gold standard. The score is often `1.0` for a perfect match and `0.0` for a mismatch, but it can also be a fractional score (e.g., for F1 score).
 38: 
 39: `dspy.Evaluate` takes these three ingredients, runs your program on all examples in the dataset, uses your metric function to score each prediction against the gold standard, and finally reports the average score across the entire dataset.
 40: 
 41: ## Evaluating a Simple Question Answering Program
 42: 
 43: Let's illustrate this with a simple example. Suppose we have a basic DSPy program that's supposed to answer simple questions.
 44: 
 45: ```python
 46: import dspy
 47: 
 48: # Assume we have configured an LM client (Chapter 5)
 49: # gpt3_turbo = dspy.LM(model='openai/gpt-3.5-turbo')
 50: # dspy.settings.configure(lm=gpt3_turbo)
 51: 
 52: # A simple program using dspy.Predict (Chapter 4)
 53: class BasicQA(dspy.Module):
 54:     def __init__(self):
 55:         super().__init__()
 56:         # Use a simple signature: question -> answer
 57:         self.predictor = dspy.Predict('question -> answer')
 58: 
 59:     def forward(self, question):
 60:         return self.predictor(question=question)
 61: 
 62: # Create an instance of our program
 63: qa_program = BasicQA()
 64: ```
 65: 
 66: Now, let's prepare the other ingredients for evaluation.
 67: 
 68: **1. Prepare the Dataset (`devset`)**
 69: 
 70: We need a list of `dspy.Example` objects, each containing a `question` (input) and the correct `answer` (gold standard output).
 71: 
 72: ```python
 73: # Create example data points with questions and gold answers
 74: dev_example1 = dspy.Example(question="What color is the sky?", answer="blue")
 75: dev_example2 = dspy.Example(question="What is 2 + 2?", answer="4")
 76: dev_example3 = dspy.Example(question="What is the capital of France?", answer="Paris")
 77: dev_example_wrong = dspy.Example(question="Who wrote Hamlet?", answer="Shakespeare") # Let's assume our QA program might get this wrong
 78: 
 79: # Create the development set (list of examples)
 80: devset = [dev_example1, dev_example2, dev_example3, dev_example_wrong]
 81: 
 82: # We need to tell DSPy which fields are inputs vs outputs for evaluation
 83: # The .with_inputs() method marks the input keys.
 84: # The remaining keys ('answer' in this case) are treated as labels.
 85: devset = [d.with_inputs('question') for d in devset]
 86: ```
 87: Here, we've created a small dataset `devset` with four question-answer pairs. We used `.with_inputs('question')` to mark the `question` field as the input; `dspy.Evaluate` will automatically treat the remaining field (`answer`) as the gold label to compare against.
 88: 
 89: **2. Define a Metric Function (`metric`)**
 90: 
 91: We need a function that compares the program's predicted answer to the gold answer in an example. Let's create a simple "exact match" metric.
 92: 
 93: ```python
 94: def simple_exact_match_metric(gold_example, prediction, trace=None):
 95:     # Does the predicted 'answer' EXACTLY match the gold 'answer'?
 96:     # '.answer' field comes from our Predict signature 'question -> answer'
 97:     # 'gold_example.answer' is the gold label from the devset example
 98:     return prediction.answer == gold_example.answer
 99: 
100: # Note: DSPy often provides common metrics too, like dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match
101: # import dspy.evaluate
102: # metric = dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match
103: ```
104: Our `simple_exact_match_metric` function takes the gold `dspy.Example` (`gold_example`) and the program's output `dspy.Prediction` (`prediction`). It returns `True` (which Python treats as `1.0`) if the predicted `answer` matches the gold `answer`, and `False` (`0.0`) otherwise. The `trace` argument is optional and can be ignored for basic metrics; it sometimes contains information about the program's execution steps.
105: 
106: **3. Create and Run `dspy.Evaluate`**
107: 
108: Now we have all the ingredients: `qa_program`, `devset`, and `simple_exact_match_metric`. Let's use `dspy.Evaluate`.
109: 
110: ```python
111: from dspy.evaluate import Evaluate
112: 
113: # 1. Create the Evaluator instance
114: evaluator = Evaluate(
115:     devset=devset,            # The dataset to evaluate on
116:     metric=simple_exact_match_metric, # The function to score predictions
117:     num_threads=4,            # Run 4 evaluations in parallel (optional)
118:     display_progress=True,    # Show a progress bar (optional)
119:     display_table=True        # Display results in a table (optional)
120: )
121: 
122: # 2. Run the evaluation by calling the evaluator with the program
123: # This will run qa_program on each example in devset,
124: # score it using simple_exact_match_metric, and return the average score.
125: average_score = evaluator(qa_program)
126: 
127: print(f"Average Score: {average_score}%")
128: ```
129: 
130: **What happens here?**
131: 
132: 1.  We create an `Evaluate` object, providing our dataset and metric. We also request parallel execution (`num_threads=4`) for speed and ask for progress/table display.
133: 2.  We call the `evaluator` instance with our `qa_program`.
134: 3.  `Evaluate` iterates through `devset`:
135:     *   For `dev_example1`, it calls `qa_program(question="What color is the sky?")`. Let's assume the program predicts `answer="blue"`.
136:     *   It calls `simple_exact_match_metric(dev_example1, predicted_output)`. Since `"blue" == "blue"`, the score is `1.0`.
137:     *   It does the same for `dev_example2` (input: "What is 2 + 2?"). Assume prediction is `answer="4"`. Score: `1.0`.
138:     *   It does the same for `dev_example3` (input: "What is the capital of France?"). Assume prediction is `answer="Paris"`. Score: `1.0`.
139:     *   It does the same for `dev_example_wrong` (input: "Who wrote Hamlet?"). Maybe the simple LM messes up and predicts `answer="William Shakespeare"`. Since `"William Shakespeare" != "Shakespeare"`, the score is `0.0`.
140: 4.  `Evaluate` calculates the average score: `(1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.0) / 4 = 0.75`.
141: 5.  It prints the average score as a percentage.
142: 
143: **Expected Output:**
144: 
145: A progress bar will be shown (if `tqdm` is installed), followed by a table like this (requires `pandas`):
146: 
147: ```text
148: Average Metric: 3 / 4  (75.0%)
149:   question                           answer      simple_exact_match_metric
150: 0 What color is the sky?           blue        ✔️ [True]
151: 1 What is 2 + 2?                   4           ✔️ [True]
152: 2 What is the capital of France?   Paris       ✔️ [True]
153: 3 Who wrote Hamlet?                Shakespeare 
154: ```
155: *(Note: The table shows the predicted answer if different, otherwise just the metric outcome. The exact table format might vary slightly).*
156: 
157: And finally:
158: ```text
159: Average Score: 75.0%
160: ```
161: 
162: This tells us our simple QA program achieved 75% accuracy on our small development set using the exact match criterion.
163: 
164: ## Getting More Details (Optional Flags)
165: 
166: Sometimes, just the average score isn't enough. You might want to see the score for each individual example or the actual predictions made by the program. `Evaluate` provides flags for this:
167: 
168: *   `return_all_scores=True`: Returns the average score *and* a list containing the individual score for each example.
169: *   `return_outputs=True`: Returns the average score *and* a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `(example, prediction, score)`.
170: 
171: ```python
172: # Re-run evaluation asking for more details
173: evaluator_detailed = Evaluate(devset=devset, metric=simple_exact_match_metric)
174: 
175: # Get individual scores
176: avg_score, individual_scores = evaluator_detailed(qa_program, return_all_scores=True)
177: print(f"Individual Scores: {individual_scores}") # Output: [True, True, True, False]
178: 
179: # Get full outputs
180: avg_score, outputs_list = evaluator_detailed(qa_program, return_outputs=True)
181: # outputs_list[0] would be roughly: (dev_example1, Prediction(answer='blue'), True)
182: # outputs_list[3] would be roughly: (dev_example_wrong, Prediction(answer='William Shakespeare'), False)
183: print(f"Number of outputs returned: {len(outputs_list)}") # Output: 4
184: ```
185: 
186: These flags are useful for more detailed error analysis to understand *where* your program is failing.
187: 
188: ## How It Works Under the Hood
189: 
190: What happens internally when you call `evaluator(program)`?
191: 
192: 1.  **Initialization:** The `Evaluate` instance stores the `devset`, `metric`, `num_threads`, and other settings.
193: 2.  **Parallel Executor:** It creates a `ParallelExecutor` (if `num_threads > 1`) to manage running the evaluations concurrently.
194: 3.  **Iteration:** It iterates through each `example` in the `devset`.
195: 4.  **Program Execution:** For each `example`, it calls `program(**example.inputs())` (e.g., `qa_program(question=example.question)`). This runs your DSPy program's `forward` method to get a `prediction`.
196: 5.  **Metric Calculation:** It calls the provided `metric` function, passing it the original `example` (which contains the gold labels) and the `prediction` object returned by the program (e.g., `metric(example, prediction)`). This yields a `score`.
197: 6.  **Error Handling:** If running the program or the metric causes an error for a specific example, `Evaluate` catches it (up to `max_errors`), records a default `failure_score` (usually 0.0), and continues with the rest of the dataset.
198: 7.  **Aggregation:** It collects all the individual scores (including failure scores).
199: 8.  **Calculate Average:** It computes the average score by summing all scores and dividing by the total number of examples in the `devset`.
200: 9.  **Return Results:** It returns the average score (and optionally the individual scores or full output tuples based on the flags).

232:     *   The `__call__` method orchestrates the evaluation: sets up the `ParallelExecutor`, defines the `process_item` function (which runs the program and metric for one example), executes it over the `devset`, aggregates results, and handles display/return logic.
233: *   `dspy/utils/parallelizer.py`: Contains the `ParallelExecutor` class used for running tasks concurrently across multiple threads or processes.

286:                 prediction, score = r
287:             results.append((example, prediction, score))

291:         num_examples = len(devset)
292:         average_score = round(100 * total_score / num_examples, 2) if num_examples > 0 else 0

299:         # ... logic to construct return tuple ...
300:         return average_score # Base return value
301: ```
302: 
303: The core logic involves running the program and the metric function for each data point, handling potential errors, and averaging the results, with parallel processing to speed things up.
304: 
305: ## Conclusion
306: 
307: You've now learned about `dspy.Evaluate`, the standard way to measure the performance of your DSPy programs!
308: 
309: *   `Evaluate` acts as an **automated grader** for your DSPy modules.
310: *   It requires three ingredients: your **program**, a **dataset (`devset`)** with gold labels, and a **metric function** to compare predictions against labels.
311: *   It runs the program on the dataset, applies the metric, and reports the **average score**.
312: *   It supports **parallel execution** for speed and offers options to display progress, show results tables, and return detailed outputs.
313: 
314: Knowing how well your program performs is essential. But what if the score isn't good enough? How can we *improve* the program, perhaps by automatically finding better prompts or few-shot examples?
315: 
316: That's precisely what **Teleprompters** (Optimizers) are designed for! Let's dive into how DSPy can help automatically optimize your programs next.

  8: # Chapter 8: Teleprompter / Optimizer - Your Program's Coach
  9: 
 10: Welcome to Chapter 8! In [Chapter 7: Evaluate](07_evaluate.md), we learned how to grade our DSPy programs using metrics and datasets to see how well they perform. That's great for knowing our score, but what if the score isn't high enough?
 11: 
 12: Think about building our `BasicQA` program from the last chapter. Maybe we tried running it and found it only got 75% accuracy. How do we improve it?
 13: 
 14: Traditionally, we might start **manually tweaking prompts**:
 15: *   "Maybe I should rephrase the instructions?"
 16: *   "Should I add some examples (few-shot demonstrations)?"
 17: *   "Which examples work best?"
 18: 
 19: This manual process, often called "prompt engineering," can be slow, tedious, and requires a lot of guesswork. Wouldn't it be amazing if DSPy could **automatically figure out the best prompts and examples** for us?
 20: 
 21: That's exactly what **Teleprompters** (also called Optimizers) do! They are DSPy's built-in automated prompt engineers and program tuners.
 22: 
 23: Think of a Teleprompter as a **coach** for your DSPy program (the 'student'):
 24: *   The coach observes how the student performs on practice drills (a dataset).
 25: *   It uses feedback (a metric) to figure out weaknesses.
 26: *   It suggests new strategies (better instructions, better examples) to improve performance.
 27: *   It repeats this until the student performs much better!
 28: 
 29: In this chapter, we'll learn:
 30: 
 31: *   What a Teleprompter is and the problem it solves.
 32: *   The key ingredients needed to use a Teleprompter.
 33: *   How to use a simple Teleprompter (`BootstrapFewShot`) to automatically find good few-shot examples.
 34: *   The basic idea behind how Teleprompters optimize programs.
 35: 
 36: Let's automate the improvement process!
 37: 
 38: ## What is a Teleprompter / Optimizer?
 39: 
 40: A `Teleprompter` in DSPy is an algorithm that takes your DSPy [Program](01_module___program.md) (the 'student') and automatically tunes its internal parameters to maximize performance on a given task. These parameters are most often:
 41: 
 42: 1.  **Instructions:** The natural language guidance given to the Language Models ([LM](05_lm__language_model_client_.md)) within your program's modules (like `dspy.Predict`).
 43: 2.  **Few-Shot Examples (Demos):** The `dspy.Example` objects provided in prompts to show the LM how to perform the task.
 44: 
 45: Some advanced Teleprompters can even fine-tune the weights of the LM itself!
 46: 
 47: To work its magic, a Teleprompter needs three things (sound familiar? They're similar to evaluation!):
 48: 
 49: 1.  **The Student Program:** The DSPy program you want to improve.
 50: 2.  **A Training Dataset (`trainset`):** A list of `dspy.Example` objects ([Chapter 3: Example](03_example.md)) representing the task. The Teleprompter will use this data to practice and learn.
 51: 3.  **A Metric Function (`metric`):** The same kind of function we used in [Chapter 7: Evaluate](07_evaluate.md). It tells the Teleprompter how well the student program is doing on each example in the `trainset`.
 52: 
 53: The Teleprompter uses the `metric` to guide its search for better instructions or demos, trying different combinations and keeping the ones that yield the highest score on the `trainset`. The output is an **optimized version of your student program**.
 54: 
 55: ## Use Case: Automatically Finding Good Few-Shot Examples with `BootstrapFewShot`
 56: 
 57: Let's revisit our `BasicQA` program and the evaluation setup from Chapter 7.
 58: 
 59: ```python
 60: import dspy
 61: from dspy.evaluate import Evaluate
 62: # Assume LM is configured (e.g., dspy.settings.configure(lm=...))
 63: 
 64: # Our simple program
 65: class BasicQA(dspy.Module):
 66:     def __init__(self):
 67:         super().__init__()
 68:         self.predictor = dspy.Predict('question -> answer')
 69: 
 70:     def forward(self, question):
 71:         return self.predictor(question=question)
 72: 
 73: # Our metric from Chapter 7
 74: def simple_exact_match_metric(gold, prediction, trace=None):
 75:     return prediction.answer.lower() == gold.answer.lower()
 76: 
 77: # Our dataset from Chapter 7 (let's use it as a trainset now)
 78: dev_example1 = dspy.Example(question="What color is the sky?", answer="blue")
 79: dev_example2 = dspy.Example(question="What is 2 + 2?", answer="4")
 80: dev_example3 = dspy.Example(question="What is the capital of France?", answer="Paris")
 81: # Example our program might struggle with initially
 82: dev_example_hard = dspy.Example(question="Who painted the Mona Lisa?", answer="Leonardo da Vinci")
 83: 
 84: trainset = [dev_example1, dev_example2, dev_example3, dev_example_hard]
 85: trainset = [d.with_inputs('question') for d in trainset]
 86: 
 87: # Let's evaluate the initial program (likely imperfect)
 88: initial_program = BasicQA()
 89: evaluator = Evaluate(devset=trainset, metric=simple_exact_match_metric, display_progress=False)
 90: initial_score = evaluator(initial_program)
 91: print(f"Initial Score (on trainset): {initial_score}%")
 92: # Might output: Initial Score (on trainset): 75.0% (assuming it fails the last one)
 93: ```
 94: 
 95: Our initial program gets 75%. We could try adding few-shot examples manually, but which ones? And how many?
 96: 
 97: Let's use `dspy.teleprompt.BootstrapFewShot`. This Teleprompter automatically creates and selects few-shot demonstrations for the predictors in your program.
 98: 
 99: **1. Import the Teleprompter:**
100: 
101: ```python
102: from dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShot
103: ```
104: 
105: **2. Instantiate the Teleprompter:**
106: We need to give it the `metric` function it should use to judge success. We can also specify how many candidate demos (`max_bootstrapped_demos`) it should try to find for each predictor.
107: 
108: ```python
109: # Configure the BootstrapFewShot optimizer
110: # It will use the metric to find successful demonstrations
111: # max_bootstrapped_demos=4 means it will try to find up to 4 good examples for EACH predictor
112: config = dict(max_bootstrapped_demos=4, metric=simple_exact_match_metric)
113: teleprompter = BootstrapFewShot(**config)
114: ```
115: 
116: **3. Compile the Program:**
117: This is the main step. We call the Teleprompter's `compile` method, giving it our initial `student` program and the `trainset`. It returns a *new*, optimized program.
118: 
119: ```python
120: # Compile the program!
121: # This runs the optimization process using the trainset.
122: # It uses a 'teacher' model (often the student itself or a copy)
123: # to generate traces, finds successful ones via the metric,
124: # and adds them as demos to the student's predictors.
125: compiled_program = teleprompter.compile(student=initial_program, trainset=trainset)
126: 
127: # The 'compiled_program' is a new instance of BasicQA,
128: # but its internal predictor now has few-shot examples added!
129: ```
130: 
131: **What just happened?**
132: 
133: Behind the scenes, `BootstrapFewShot` (conceptually):
134: *   Used a "teacher" program (often a copy of the student or another specified LM configuration) to run each example in the `trainset`.
135: *   For each example, it checked if the teacher's output was correct using our `simple_exact_match_metric`.
136: *   If an example was processed correctly, the Teleprompter saved the input/output pair as a potential "demonstration" (a good example).
137: *   It collected these successful demonstrations.
138: *   It assigned a selection of these good demonstrations (`max_bootstrapped_demos`) to the `demos` attribute of the corresponding predictor inside our `compiled_program`.
139: 
140: **4. Evaluate the Compiled Program:**
141: Now, let's see if the optimized program performs better on the same `trainset`.
142: 
143: ```python
144: # Evaluate the compiled program
145: compiled_score = evaluator(compiled_program)
146: print(f"Compiled Score (on trainset): {compiled_score}%")
147: 
148: # If the optimization worked, the score should be higher!
149: # Might output: Compiled Score (on trainset): 100.0%
150: ```
151: 
152: If `BootstrapFewShot` found good examples (like the "Mona Lisa" one after the teacher model successfully answered it), the `compiled_program` now has these examples embedded in its prompts, helping the LM perform better on similar questions. We automated the process of finding effective few-shot examples!
153: 
154: ## How Optimization Works (Conceptual)
155: 
156: Different Teleprompters use different strategies, but the core idea is usually:
157: 
158: 1.  **Goal:** Find program parameters (instructions, demos) that maximize the `metric` score on the `trainset`.
159: 2.  **Search Space:** The "space" of all possible instructions or combinations of demos.
160: 3.  **Search Strategy:** How the Teleprompter explores this space.
161:     *   `BootstrapFewShot`: Generates candidate demos based on successful teacher executions.
162:     *   Other optimizers (like `COPRO` or `MIPROv2` mentioned in the code snippets) might use an LM to *propose* new instructions, evaluate them, and iterate. Some use sophisticated search algorithms like Bayesian Optimization or random search.
163: 4.  **Evaluation:** Use the `metric` and `trainset` to score each candidate configuration (e.g., a program with specific demos or instructions).
164: 5.  **Selection:** Keep the configuration that resulted in the best score.
165: 
166: **Analogy Revisited:**
167: 
168: *   **Coach:** The Teleprompter algorithm (`BootstrapFewShot`).
169: *   **Student:** Your DSPy `Program` (`initial_program`).
170: *   **Practice Drills:** The `trainset`.
171: *   **Scoring:** The `metric` function (`simple_exact_match_metric`).
172: *   **Trying Techniques:** Generating/selecting different demos or instructions.
173: *   **Adopting Best Techniques:** Creating the `compiled_program` with the highest-scoring demos/instructions found.
174: 
175: ## How It Works Under the Hood (`BootstrapFewShot` Peek)
176: 
177: Let's briefly look at the internal flow for `BootstrapFewShot.compile()`:
178: 
179: 1.  **Prepare Teacher:** It sets up a 'teacher' program. This is often a copy of the student program, sometimes configured with specific settings (like a higher temperature for more exploration) or potentially using labeled examples if provided (`LabeledFewShot` within `BootstrapFewShot`).
180: 2.  **Iterate Trainset:** It goes through each `example` in the `trainset`.
181: 3.  **Teacher Execution:** For each `example`, it runs the `teacher` program (`teacher(**example.inputs())`). This happens within a `dspy.settings.context` block to capture the execution `trace`.
182: 4.  **Metric Check:** It uses the provided `metric` to compare the `teacher`'s prediction against the `example`'s gold label (`metric(example, prediction, trace)`).
183: 5.  **Collect Demos:** If the `metric` returns success (e.g., `True` or a score above a threshold), the Teleprompter extracts the input/output steps from the execution `trace`. Each successful trace step can become a candidate `dspy.Example` demonstration.
184: 6.  **Assign Demos:** After iterating through the `trainset`, it takes the collected successful demonstrations (up to `max_bootstrapped_demos`) and assigns them to the `demos` attribute of the corresponding predictors in the `student` program instance.
185: 7.  **Return Compiled Student:** It returns the modified `student` program, which now contains the bootstrapped few-shot examples.

302: 
303: ## Conclusion
304: 
305: You've now learned about DSPy's **Teleprompters / Optimizers**, the powerful tools for automating prompt engineering!
306: 
307: *   Teleprompters act like **coaches**, automatically tuning your DSPy programs (students).
308: *   They optimize parameters like **instructions** and **few-shot examples (demos)**.
309: *   They require a **student program**, a **training dataset**, and a **metric** function.
310: *   We saw how `BootstrapFewShot` automatically finds effective few-shot examples by running a teacher model and collecting successful execution traces.
311: *   The result of `teleprompter.compile()` is an **optimized program** instance, ready to be used or evaluated further.
312: 
313: Teleprompters save you from the tedious process of manual tuning, allowing you to build high-performing LM-based programs more efficiently.
314: 
315: Now that we understand how to build, evaluate, and automatically optimize DSPy programs, how can we make them interact smoothly with different data formats or models, especially when integrating with other systems? That's where **Adapters** come in.

  8: # Chapter 9: Adapter - The Universal Translator
  9: 
 10: Welcome to Chapter 9! In [Chapter 8: Teleprompter / Optimizer](08_teleprompter___optimizer.md), we saw how DSPy can automatically optimize our programs by finding better prompts or few-shot examples. We ended up with a `compiled_program` that should perform better.
 11: 
 12: Now, this optimized program needs to communicate with a Language Model ([LM](05_lm__language_model_client_.md)) to actually do its work. But here's a potential challenge: different types of LMs expect different kinds of input!
 13: *   Older **Completion Models** (like GPT-3 `davinci`) expect a single, long text prompt.
 14: *   Newer **Chat Models** (like GPT-4, Claude 3, Llama 3 Chat) expect a structured list of messages, each with a role (like "system", "user", or "assistant").
 15: 
 16: Our DSPy program, using its [Signature](02_signature.md), defines the task in an abstract way (inputs, outputs, instructions). How does this abstract definition get translated into the specific format required by the LM we're using, especially these modern chat models?
 17: 
 18: That's where the **`Adapter`** comes in! It acts like a universal translator.
 19: 
 20: Think of it like this:
 21: *   Your DSPy program (using a `Signature`) has a message it wants to send to the LM.
 22: *   The LM speaks a specific language (e.g., "chat message list" language).
 23: *   The `Adapter` translates your program's message into the LM's language, handles the conversation, and translates the LM's reply back into a format your DSPy program understands.
 24: 
 25: In this chapter, you'll learn:
 26: 
 27: *   What problem Adapters solve.
 28: *   What an `Adapter` does (formatting and parsing).
 29: *   How they allow your DSPy code to work with different LMs seamlessly.
 30: *   How they work behind the scenes (mostly automatically!).
 31: 
 32: Let's meet the translator!
 33: 
 34: ## The Problem: Different LMs, Different Languages
 35: 
 36: Imagine you have a DSPy Signature for summarizing text:
 37: 
 38: ```python
 39: import dspy
 40: 
 41: class Summarize(dspy.Signature):
 42:   """Summarize the given text."""
 43:   text = dspy.InputField(desc="The text to summarize.")
 44:   summary = dspy.OutputField(desc="A concise summary.")
 45: ```
 46: 
 47: And you use it in a `dspy.Predict` module:
 48: 
 49: ```python
 50: # Assume LM is configured (Chapter 5)
 51: summarizer = dspy.Predict(Summarize)
 52: long_text = "DSPy is a framework for programming foundation models..." # (imagine longer text)
 53: result = summarizer(text=long_text)
 54: # We expect result.summary to contain the summary
 55: ```
 56: 
 57: Now, if the configured LM is a **completion model**, the `summarizer` needs to create a single prompt like:
 58: 
 59: ```text
 60: Summarize the given text.
 61: 
 62: ---
 63: 
 64: Follow the following format.
 65: 
 66: Text: ${text}
 67: Summary: ${summary}
 68: 
 69: ---
 70: 
 71: Text: DSPy is a framework for programming foundation models...
 72: Summary: 
 73: ```
 74: 
 75: But if the configured LM is a **chat model**, it needs a structured list of messages, perhaps like this:
 76: 
 77: ```python
 78: [
 79:   {"role": "system", "content": "Summarize the given text.\n\nFollow the following format.\n\nText: ${text}\nSummary: ${summary}"},
 80:   {"role": "user", "content": "Text: DSPy is a framework for programming foundation models...\nSummary:"}
 81: ]
 82: ```
 83: *(Simplified - actual chat formatting can be more complex)*
 84: 
 85: How does `dspy.Predict` know which format to use? And how does it extract the `summary` from the potentially differently formatted responses? It doesn't! That's the job of the **Adapter**.
 86: 
 87: ## What Does an Adapter Do?
 88: 
 89: An `Adapter` is a component that sits between your DSPy module (like `dspy.Predict`) and the [LM Client](05_lm__language_model_client_.md). Its main tasks are:
 90: 
 91: 1.  **Formatting:** It takes the abstract information from DSPy – the [Signature](02_signature.md) (instructions, input/output fields), any few-shot `demos` ([Example](03_example.md)), and the current `inputs` – and **formats** it into the specific structure the target LM expects (either a single string or a list of chat messages).
 92: 2.  **Parsing:** After the LM generates its response (which is usually just raw text), the `Adapter` **parses** this text to extract the values for the output fields defined in the `Signature` (like extracting the generated `summary` text).
 93: 
 94: The most common adapter is the `dspy.adapters.ChatAdapter`, which is specifically designed to translate between the DSPy format and the message list format expected by chat models.
 95: 
 96: ## Why Use Adapters? Flexibility!
 97: 
 98: The main benefit of using Adapters is **flexibility**.
 99: 
100: *   **Write Once, Run Anywhere:** Your core DSPy program logic (your `Module`s, `Program`s, and `Signature`s) remains the same regardless of whether you're using a completion LM or a chat LM.
101: *   **Easy Switching:** You can switch the underlying [LM Client](05_lm__language_model_client_.md) (e.g., from OpenAI GPT-3 to Anthropic Claude 3) in `dspy.settings`, and the appropriate Adapter (usually the default `ChatAdapter`) handles the communication differences automatically.
102: *   **Standard Interface:** Adapters ensure that modules like `dspy.Predict` have a consistent way to interact with LMs, hiding the complexities of different API formats.
103: 
104: ## How Adapters Work: Format and Parse
105: 
106: Let's look conceptually at what the `ChatAdapter` does:
107: 
108: **1. Formatting (`format` method):**
109: 
110: Imagine calling our `summarizer` with one demo example:
111: 
112: ```python
113: # Demo example
114: demo = dspy.Example(
115:     text="Long article about cats.",
116:     summary="Cats are popular pets."
117: ).with_inputs("text")
118: 
119: # Call the summarizer with the demo
120: result = summarizer(text=long_text, demos=[demo])
121: ```
122: 
123: The `ChatAdapter`'s `format` method might take the `Summarize` signature, the `demo`, and the `long_text` input and produce a list of messages like this:
124: 
125: ```python
126: # Conceptual Output of ChatAdapter.format()
127: [
128:   # 1. System message from Signature instructions
129:   {"role": "system", "content": "Summarize the given text.\n\n---\n\nFollow the following format.\n\nText: ${text}\nSummary: ${summary}\n\n---\n\n"},
130: 
131:   # 2. User turn for the demo input
132:   {"role": "user", "content": "Text: Long article about cats.\nSummary:"},
133: 
134:   # 3. Assistant turn for the demo output
135:   {"role": "assistant", "content": "Summary: Cats are popular pets."}, # (Might use special markers like [[ ## Summary ## ]])
136: 
137:   # 4. User turn for the actual input
138:   {"role": "user", "content": "Text: DSPy is a framework for programming foundation models...\nSummary:"}
139: ]
140: ```
141: *(Note: `ChatAdapter` uses specific markers like `[[ ## field_name ## ]]` to clearly separate fields in the content, making parsing easier)*
142: 
143: This message list is then passed to the chat-based LM Client.
144: 
145: **2. Parsing (`parse` method):**
146: 
147: The chat LM responds, likely mimicking the format. Its response might be a string like:
148: 
149: ```text
150: [[ ## summary ## ]]
151: DSPy helps build and optimize language model pipelines.
152: ```
153: 
154: The `ChatAdapter`'s `parse` method takes this string. It looks for the markers (`[[ ## summary ## ]]`) defined by the `Summarize` signature's output fields. It extracts the content associated with each marker and returns a dictionary:
155: 
156: ```python
157: # Conceptual Output of ChatAdapter.parse()
158: {
159:   "summary": "DSPy helps build and optimize language model pipelines."
160: }
161: ```
162: This dictionary is then packaged into the `dspy.Prediction` object (as `result.summary`) that your `summarizer` module returns.
163: 
164: ## Using Adapters (It's Often Automatic!)
165: 
166: The good news is that you usually don't interact with Adapters directly. Modules like `dspy.Predict` are designed to use the currently configured adapter automatically.
167: 
168: DSPy sets a default adapter (usually `ChatAdapter`) in its global `dspy.settings`. When you configure your [LM Client](05_lm__language_model_client_.md) like this:
169: 
170: ```python
171: import dspy
172: 
173: # Configure LM (Chapter 5)
174: # turbo = dspy.LM(model='openai/gpt-3.5-turbo')
175: # dspy.settings.configure(lm=turbo)
176: 
177: # Default Adapter (ChatAdapter) is usually active automatically!
178: # You typically DON'T need to configure it unless you want a different one.
179: # dspy.settings.configure(adapter=dspy.adapters.ChatAdapter())
180: ```
181: 
182: Now, when you use `dspy.Predict` or other modules that call LMs, they will internally use `dspy.settings.adapter` (the `ChatAdapter` in this case) to handle the formatting and parsing needed to talk to the configured `dspy.settings.lm` (`turbo`).
183: 
184: ```python
185: # The summarizer automatically uses the configured LM and Adapter
186: summarizer = dspy.Predict(Summarize)
187: result = summarizer(text=long_text) # Adapter works its magic here!
188: print(result.summary)
189: ```
190: 
191: You write your DSPy code at a higher level of abstraction, and the Adapter handles the translation details for you.
192: 
193: ## How It Works Under the Hood
194: 
195: Let's trace the flow when `summarizer(text=long_text)` is called, assuming a chat LM and the `ChatAdapter` are configured:
196: 
197: 1.  **`Predict.__call__`:** The `summarizer` (`dspy.Predict`) instance is called.
198: 2.  **Get Components:** It retrieves the `Signature` (`Summarize`), `demos`, `inputs` (`text`), the configured `LM` client, and the configured `Adapter` (e.g., `ChatAdapter`) from `dspy.settings`.
199: 3.  **`Adapter.__call__`:** `Predict` calls the `Adapter` instance, passing it the LM, signature, demos, and inputs.
200: 4.  **`Adapter.format`:** The `Adapter`'s `__call__` method first calls its own `format` method. `ChatAdapter.format` generates the list of chat messages (system prompt, demo turns, final user turn).
201: 5.  **`LM.__call__`:** The `Adapter`'s `__call__` method then passes the formatted messages to the `LM` client instance (e.g., `turbo(messages=...)`).
202: 6.  **API Call:** The `LM` client sends the messages to the actual LM API (e.g., OpenAI API).
203: 7.  **API Response:** The LM API returns the generated completion text (e.g., `[[ ## summary ## ]]\nDSPy helps...`).
204: 8.  **`LM.__call__` Returns:** The `LM` client returns the raw completion string(s) back to the `Adapter`.
205: 9.  **`Adapter.parse`:** The `Adapter`'s `__call__` method calls its own `parse` method with the completion string. `ChatAdapter.parse` extracts the content based on the `[[ ## ... ## ]]` markers and the `Signature`'s output fields.
206: 10. **`Adapter.__call__` Returns:** The `Adapter` returns a list of dictionaries, each representing a parsed completion (e.g., `[{'summary': 'DSPy helps...'}]`).
207: 11. **`Predict.__call__` Returns:** `Predict` packages these parsed dictionaries into `dspy.Prediction` objects and returns the result.

351: 
352: The key takeaway is that `Adapter` subclasses provide concrete implementations for `format` (DSPy -> LM format) and `parse` (LM output -> DSPy format), enabling smooth communication.
353: 
354: ## Conclusion
355: 
356: You've now met the **`Adapter`**, DSPy's universal translator!
357: 
358: *   Adapters solve the problem of **different LMs expecting different input formats** (e.g., completion prompts vs. chat messages).
359: *   They act as a bridge, **formatting** DSPy's abstract [Signature](02_signature.md), demos, and inputs into the LM-specific format, and **parsing** the LM's raw output back into structured DSPy data.
360: *   The primary benefit is **flexibility**, allowing you to use the same DSPy program with various LM types without changing your core logic.
361: *   Adapters like `ChatAdapter` usually work **automatically** behind the scenes, configured via `dspy.settings`.
362: 
363: With Adapters handling the translation, LM Clients providing the connection, and RMs fetching knowledge, we have a powerful toolkit. But how do we manage all these configurations globally? That's the role of `dspy.settings`.

  8: # Chapter 10: Settings - Your Program's Control Panel
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the final chapter of our introductory DSPy tutorial! In [Chapter 9: Adapter](09_adapter.md), we saw how Adapters act as translators, allowing our DSPy programs to communicate seamlessly with different types of Language Models (LMs).
 11: 
 12: Throughout the previous chapters, we've seen snippets like `dspy.settings.configure(lm=...)` and `dspy.settings.configure(rm=...)`. We mentioned that modules like `dspy.Predict` or `dspy.Retrieve` automatically find and use these configured components. But how does this central configuration work? How do we manage these important defaults for our entire project?
 13: 
 14: That's where **`dspy.settings`** comes in! It's the central control panel for your DSPy project.
 15: 
 16: Think of `dspy.settings` like the **Defaults menu** in a software application:
 17: *   You set your preferred font, theme, or language once in the settings.
 18: *   The entire application then uses these defaults unless you specifically choose something different for a particular document or window.
 19: 
 20: `dspy.settings` does the same for your DSPy programs. It holds the default [LM (Language Model Client)](05_lm__language_model_client_.md), [RM (Retrieval Model Client)](06_rm__retrieval_model_client_.md), and [Adapter](09_adapter.md) that your modules will use.
 21: 
 22: In this chapter, you'll learn:
 23: 
 24: *   Why a central settings object is useful.
 25: *   How to configure global defaults using `dspy.settings.configure`.
 26: *   How modules automatically use these settings.
 27: *   How to temporarily override settings for specific parts of your code using `dspy.context`.
 28: 
 29: Let's learn how to manage our program's defaults!
 30: 
 31: ## Why Use `dspy.settings`?
 32: 
 33: Imagine building a complex DSPy [Program](01_module___program.md) with many sub-modules that need to call an LM or an RM. Without a central settings object, you might have to pass the LM and RM instances explicitly to every single module during initialization or when calling them. This would be tedious and make your code harder to manage.
 34: 
 35: ```python
 36: # --- WITHOUT dspy.settings (Conceptual - DON'T DO THIS) ---
 37: import dspy
 38: 
 39: # Assume lm_instance and rm_instance are created somewhere
 40: 
 41: class GenerateSearchQuery(dspy.Module):
 42:     def __init__(self, lm): # Needs LM passed in
 43:         self.predictor = dspy.Predict('question -> query', lm=lm) # Pass LM to Predict
 44:     # ... forward ...
 45: 
 46: class RetrieveContext(dspy.Module):
 47:     def __init__(self, rm): # Needs RM passed in
 48:         self.retriever = dspy.Retrieve(rm=rm, k=3) # Pass RM to Retrieve
 49:     # ... forward ...
 50: 
 51: # ... other modules needing lm or rm ...
 52:

 54:     def __init__(self, lm, rm): # Needs LM and RM passed in
 55:         self.gen_query = GenerateSearchQuery(lm=lm) # Pass LM down
 56:         self.retrieve = RetrieveContext(rm=rm)    # Pass RM down
 57:         # ... other sub-modules needing lm or rm ...
 58: 
 59:     def forward(self, question, lm=None, rm=None): # Maybe pass them here too? Messy!
 60:         # ... use sub-modules ...
 61: ```
 62: This gets complicated quickly!
 63: 
 64: `dspy.settings` solves this by providing a single, global place to store these configurations. You configure it once, and all DSPy modules can access the defaults they need automatically.
 65: 
 66: ## Configuring Global Defaults
 67: 
 68: The primary way to set defaults is using the `dspy.settings.configure` method. You typically do this once near the beginning of your script or application.
 69: 
 70: Let's set up a default LM and RM:
 71: 
 72: ```python
 73: import dspy
 74: 
 75: # 1. Create your LM and RM instances (as seen in Chapters 5 & 6)
 76: # Example using OpenAI and a dummy RM
 77: try:
 78:     # Assumes OPENAI_API_KEY is set
 79:     turbo = dspy.LM(model='openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct', max_tokens=100)
 80: except ImportError:
 81:     print("Note: dspy[openai] not installed. Using dummy LM.")
 82:     # Define a dummy LM if OpenAI isn't available
 83:     class DummyLM(dspy.LM):
 84:         def __init__(self): super().__init__(model="dummy")
 85:         def basic_request(self, prompt, **kwargs): return {"choices": [{"text": "Dummy LM Response"}]}
 86:         def __call__(self, prompt, **kwargs): return ["Dummy LM Response"]
 87:     turbo = DummyLM()
 88: 
 89: 
 90: # Dummy RM for demonstration
 91: class DummyRM(dspy.Retrieve):
 92:      def __init__(self, k=3): super().__init__(k=k)
 93:      def forward(self, query, k=None):
 94:          k = k if k is not None else self.k
 95:          return dspy.Prediction(passages=[f"Dummy passage {i+1} for '{query}'" for i in range(k)])
 96: my_rm = DummyRM(k=3)
 97: 
 98: # 2. Configure dspy.settings with these instances
 99: dspy.settings.configure(lm=turbo, rm=my_rm)
100: 
101: # That's it! Defaults are now set globally.
102: print(f"Default LM: {dspy.settings.lm}")
103: print(f"Default RM: {dspy.settings.rm}")
104: ```
105: 
106: **Output (example):**
107: 
108: ```text
109: Default LM: LM(model='openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct', temperature=0.0, max_tokens=100, ...) # Or DummyLM
110: Default RM: Retrieve(k=3) # Or DummyRM
111: ```
112: 
113: Now, any `dspy.Predict`, `dspy.ChainOfThought`, or `dspy.Retrieve` module created *after* this configuration will automatically use `turbo` as the LM and `my_rm` as the RM, unless told otherwise explicitly.
114: 
115: ## How Modules Use the Settings
116: 
117: Modules like `dspy.Predict` and `dspy.Retrieve` are designed to look for their required components (LM or RM) in `dspy.settings` if they aren't provided directly.
118: 
119: Consider `dspy.Predict`:
120: 
121: ```python
122: import dspy
123: # Assume settings were configured as above
124: 
125: # Create a Predict module WITHOUT passing 'lm' explicitly
126: simple_predictor = dspy.Predict('input -> output')
127: 
128: # When we call it, it will automatically use dspy.settings.lm
129: result = simple_predictor(input="Tell me a fact.")
130: print(result.output)
131: ```
132: 
133: **Output (using DummyLM):**
134: 
135: ```text
136: Dummy LM Response
137: ```
138: 
139: Inside its `forward` method, `dspy.Predict` essentially does this (simplified):
140: 
141: ```python
142: # Simplified internal logic of dspy.Predict.forward()
143: def forward(self, **kwargs):
144:   # ... get signature, demos, config ...
145: 
146:   # Get the LM: Use 'lm' passed in kwargs, OR self.lm (if set), OR dspy.settings.lm
147:   lm_to_use = kwargs.pop("lm", self.lm) or dspy.settings.lm
148:   assert lm_to_use is not None, "No LM configured!"
149: 
150:   # ... format prompt using signature/demos/inputs ...
151:   # ... call lm_to_use(prompt, ...) ...
152:   # ... parse output ...
153:   # ... return Prediction ...
154: ```
155: 
156: Similarly, `dspy.Retrieve` looks for `dspy.settings.rm`:
157: 
158: ```python
159: import dspy
160: # Assume settings were configured as above
161: 
162: # Create a Retrieve module WITHOUT passing 'rm' explicitly
163: retriever = dspy.Retrieve() # Uses default k=3 from DummyRM initialization
164: 
165: # When called, it uses dspy.settings.rm
166: results = retriever(query="DSPy benefits")
167: print(results.passages)
168: ```
169: 
170: **Output (using DummyRM):**
171: 
172: ```text
173: ["Dummy passage 1 for 'DSPy benefits'", "Dummy passage 2 for 'DSPy benefits'", "Dummy passage 3 for 'DSPy benefits'"]
174: ```
175: 
176: This automatic lookup makes your program code much cleaner, as you don't need to thread the `lm` and `rm` objects through every part of your application.
177: 
178: ## Temporary Overrides with `dspy.context`
179: 
180: Sometimes, you might want to use a *different* LM or RM for just a specific part of your code, without changing the global default. For example, maybe you want to use a more powerful (and expensive) LM like GPT-4 for a critical reasoning step, while using a cheaper LM like GPT-3.5 for the rest of the program.
181: 
182: You can achieve this using the `dspy.settings.context` context manager. Changes made inside a `with dspy.settings.context(...)` block are **thread-local** and only last until the block exits.
183: 
184: ```python
185: import dspy
186: 
187: # Assume global settings have 'turbo' (GPT-3.5 or Dummy) as the LM
188: # dspy.settings.configure(lm=turbo, rm=my_rm)
189: 
190: print(f"Outside context: {dspy.settings.lm}")
191: 
192: # Let's create a more powerful (dummy) LM for demonstration
193: class DummyGPT4(dspy.LM):
194:     def __init__(self): super().__init__(model="dummy-gpt4")
195:     def basic_request(self, prompt, **kwargs): return {"choices": [{"text": "GPT-4 Dummy Response"}]}
196:     def __call__(self, prompt, **kwargs): return ["GPT-4 Dummy Response"]
197: gpt4_dummy = DummyGPT4()
198: 
199: # Use dspy.context to temporarily switch the LM
200: with dspy.settings.context(lm=gpt4_dummy, rm=None): # Temporarily set lm, unset rm
201:     print(f"Inside context: {dspy.settings.lm}")
202:     print(f"Inside context (RM): {dspy.settings.rm}")
203: 
204:     # Modules used inside this block will use the temporary settings
205:     predictor_in_context = dspy.Predict('input -> output')
206:     result_in_context = predictor_in_context(input="Complex reasoning task")
207:     print(f"Prediction in context: {result_in_context.output}")
208: 
209:     # Trying to use RM here would fail as it's None in this context
210:     # retriever_in_context = dspy.Retrieve()
211:     # retriever_in_context(query="something") # This would raise an error
212: 
213: # Settings revert back automatically outside the block
214: print(f"Outside context again: {dspy.settings.lm}")
215: print(f"Outside context again (RM): {dspy.settings.rm}")
216: ```
217: 
218: **Output (example):**
219: 
220: ```text
221: Outside context: LM(model='openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct', ...) # Or DummyLM
222: Inside context: LM(model='dummy-gpt4', ...)
223: Inside context (RM): None
224: Prediction in context: GPT-4 Dummy Response
225: Outside context again: LM(model='openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct', ...) # Or DummyLM
226: Outside context again (RM): Retrieve(k=3) # Or DummyRM
227: ```
228: 
229: Inside the `with` block, `dspy.settings.lm` temporarily pointed to `gpt4_dummy`, and `dspy.settings.rm` was temporarily `None`. The `predictor_in_context` used the temporary LM. Once the block ended, the settings automatically reverted to the global defaults.
230: 
231: This is crucial for writing clean code where different parts might need different configurations, and also essential for how DSPy's optimizers ([Chapter 8: Teleprompter / Optimizer](08_teleprompter___optimizer.md)) work internally to manage different model configurations during optimization.
232: 
233: ## How It Works Under the Hood
234: 
235: `dspy.settings` uses a combination of global variables and thread-local storage to manage configurations.
236: 
237: 1.  **Global Defaults:** There's a primary configuration dictionary (`main_thread_config`) that holds the settings configured by `dspy.settings.configure()`.
238: 2.  **Ownership:** To prevent race conditions in multi-threaded applications, only the *first* thread that calls `configure` becomes the "owner" and is allowed to make further global changes using `configure`.
239: 3.  **Thread-Local Overrides:** `dspy.settings.context()` uses Python's `threading.local` storage. When you enter a `with dspy.settings.context(...)` block, it stores the specified overrides (`lm=gpt4_dummy`, etc.) in a place specific to the current thread.
240: 4.  **Attribute Access:** When code accesses `dspy.settings.lm`, the `Settings` object first checks if there's an override for `lm` in the current thread's local storage.
241:     *   If yes, it returns the thread-local override.
242:     *   If no, it returns the value from the global `main_thread_config`.
243: 5.  **Context Exit:** When the `with` block finishes, the `context` manager restores the thread-local storage to its state *before* the block was entered, effectively removing the temporary overrides for that thread.
244:

253:     participant GlobalConfig as Global Defaults
254: 
255:     User->>Module: Call module(input=...)
256:     Module->>Settings: Get configured lm (`settings.lm`)
257:     Settings->>ThreadLocalStorage: Check for 'lm' override?
258:     alt Override Exists
259:         ThreadLocalStorage-->>Settings: Return thread-local lm
260:         Settings-->>Module: Return thread-local lm
261:     else No Override
262:         ThreadLocalStorage-->>Settings: No override found
263:         Settings->>GlobalConfig: Get global 'lm'
264:         GlobalConfig-->>Settings: Return global lm
265:         Settings-->>Module: Return global lm
266:     end
267:     Module->>Module: Use the returned lm for processing...
268:     Module-->>User: Return result
269: ```
270: 
271: This mechanism ensures that global settings are the default, but thread-specific overrides via `dspy.context` take precedence when active, providing both convenience and flexibility.
272: 
273: **Relevant Code Files:**
274: 
275: *   `dspy/dsp/utils/settings.py`: Defines the `Settings` class, the `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, manages global state (`main_thread_config`, `config_owner_thread_id`), uses `threading.local` for overrides, and implements the `configure` method and the `context` context manager.
276:

323:

332:         # Create new overrides for this context (combining global + old local + new)
333:         new_overrides = {**main_thread_config, **original_overrides, **kwargs}
334:         # Apply new overrides to thread-local storage
335:         thread_local_overrides.overrides = new_overrides
336:         try:
337:             yield # Code inside the 'with' block runs here
338:         finally:
339:             # Restore original overrides when exiting the block
340:             thread_local_overrides.overrides = original_overrides
341: 
342: # The global instance you use
343: settings = Settings()
344: ```
345: 
346: This structure elegantly handles both global defaults and safe, temporary, thread-specific overrides.
347: 
348: ## Conclusion
349: 
350: Congratulations! You've reached the end of this introductory DSPy tutorial and learned about `dspy.settings`, the central control panel.
351: 
352: *   `dspy.settings` holds **global default configurations** like the [LM](05_lm__language_model_client_.md), [RM](06_rm__retrieval_model_client_.md), and [Adapter](09_adapter.md).
353: *   You configure it **once** using `dspy.settings.configure(lm=..., rm=...)`.
354: *   DSPy modules like `dspy.Predict` and `dspy.Retrieve` automatically **use these defaults**, simplifying your code.
355: *   `dspy.context` allows for **temporary, thread-local overrides**, providing flexibility without affecting the global state.
356: 
357: By mastering these 10 chapters, you've gained a solid foundation in the core concepts of DSPy:

  8: # Chapter 1: FastAPI Application & Routing
  9: 
 10: Welcome to your first adventure with FastAPI! 👋
 11: 
 12: Imagine you want to build a small website or an API (Application Programming Interface) - a way for computers to talk to each other. How do you tell your program, "When someone visits this specific web address, run this specific piece of Python code"? That's where FastAPI comes in!
 13: 
 14: **Our Goal Today:** We'll build the simplest possible web application. When you visit the main page in your web browser, it will just say "Hello, World!". This tiny example will teach us the absolute basics of FastAPI.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Does This Solve?
 17: 
 18: Think about a big airport. There's a central control tower that manages all the planes landing and taking off. It knows which runway corresponds to which flight number.
 19: 
 20: In the world of web applications, the `FastAPI` application object is like that **control tower**. It's the central piece of your project. You need a way to tell this control tower: "Hey, if a request comes in for the main web address (`/`) using the `GET` method (which browsers use when you just visit a page), please run *this* specific Python function."
 21: 
 22: This process of connecting URLs (web addresses) and HTTP methods (like `GET`, `POST`) to your Python functions is called **Routing**. FastAPI makes this super easy and efficient.
 23: 
 24: ## Your First FastAPI Application
 25: 
 26: Let's start with the absolute minimum code needed.
 27: 
 28: 1.  **Create a file:** Make a file named `main.py`.
 29: 2.  **Write the code:**
 30: 
 31: ```python
 32: # main.py
 33: from fastapi import FastAPI
 34: 
 35: # Create the main FastAPI application object
 36: # Think of this as initializing the 'control tower'
 37: app = FastAPI()
 38: 
 39: # Define a 'route'
 40: # This tells FastAPI: If someone sends a GET request to '/', run the function below
 41: @app.get("/")
 42: async def read_root():
 43:   # This function will be executed for requests to '/'
 44:   # It returns a simple Python dictionary
 45:   return {"message": "Hello World"}
 46: 
 47: ```
 48: 
 49: **Explanation:**
 50: 
 51: *   `from fastapi import FastAPI`: We import the main `FastAPI` class. This class provides all the core functionality.
 52: *   `app = FastAPI()`: We create an *instance* of the `FastAPI` class. By convention, we call this instance `app`. This `app` variable is our central control tower.
 53: *   `@app.get("/")`: This is a Python **decorator**. It modifies the function defined right below it. Specifically, `@app.get(...)` tells FastAPI that the function `read_root` should handle incoming web requests that:
 54:     *   Use the `GET` HTTP method. This is the most common method, used by your browser when you type a URL.
 55:     *   Are for the path `/`. This is the "root" path, the main address of your site (like `http://www.example.com/`).
 56: *   `async def read_root(): ...`: This is the Python function that will actually run when someone accesses `/`.
 57:     *   `async def`: This declares an "asynchronous" function. FastAPI is built for high performance using `asyncio`. Don't worry too much about `async` right now; just know that you'll often use `async def` for your route functions.
 58:     *   `return {"message": "Hello World"}`: The function returns a standard Python dictionary. FastAPI is smart enough to automatically convert this dictionary into JSON format, which is the standard way APIs send data over the web.
 59: 
 60: ## Running Your Application
 61: 
 62: Okay, we have the code, but how do we actually *run* it so we can see "Hello, World!" in our browser? We need a web server. FastAPI applications are served by ASGI servers like **Uvicorn**.
 63: 
 64: 1.  **Install necessary libraries:**
 65:     Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
 66:     ```bash
 67:     pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard]
 68:     ```
 69:     This installs FastAPI itself and Uvicorn with helpful extras.
 70: 
 71: 2.  **Run the server:**
 72:     In the same directory where you saved `main.py`, run this command in your terminal:
 73:     ```bash
 74:     uvicorn main:app --reload
 75:     ```
 76: 
 77: **Explanation of the command:**
 78: 
 79: *   `uvicorn`: This calls the Uvicorn server program.
 80: *   `main:app`: This tells Uvicorn where to find your FastAPI application.
 81:     *   `main`: Refers to the Python file `main.py`.
 82:     *   `app`: Refers to the object named `app` you created inside `main.py` (`app = FastAPI()`).
 83: *   `--reload`: This is super helpful during development! It tells Uvicorn to automatically restart your server whenever you save changes to your `main.py` file.
 84: 
 85: You should see output similar to this in your terminal:
 86: 
 87: ```bash
 88: INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 89: INFO:     Started reloader process [xxxxx] using StatReload
 90: INFO:     Started server process [xxxxx]
 91: INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
 92: INFO:     Application startup complete.
 93: ```
 94: 
 95: Now, open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
 96: 
 97: **Result:** You should see this JSON response in your browser:
 98: 
 99: ```json
100: {"message":"Hello World"}
101: ```
102: 
103: Congratulations! You've just created and run your first FastAPI application! 🎉
104: 
105: ## Organizing Your Routes with `APIRouter`
106: 
107: Our "Hello World" example is tiny. Real applications have many different routes (like `/users/`, `/items/`, `/orders/`, etc.). Putting *all* of them in the single `main.py` file using `@app.get(...)`, `@app.post(...)` would quickly become messy and hard to manage.
108: 
109: Imagine our airport analogy again. Instead of one giant control tower managing *everything*, large airports have different terminals (Terminal A for domestic flights, Terminal B for international, etc.) to organize things.
110: 
111: FastAPI provides `APIRouter` for this exact purpose. Think of `APIRouter` as creating a **mini-application** or a **chapter** for your routes. You can group related routes together in separate files using `APIRouter`, and then "include" these routers into your main `app`.
112: 
113: **Let's organize!**
114: 
115: 1.  **Create a new file:** Let's say we want to manage routes related to "items". Create a file named `routers/items.py`. (You might need to create the `routers` directory first).
116: 
117: 2.  **Write the router code:**
118: 
119:     ```python
120:     # routers/items.py
121:     from fastapi import APIRouter
122: 
123:     # Create an APIRouter instance
124:     # This is like a mini-FastAPI app for item-related routes
125:     router = APIRouter()
126: 
127:     # Define a route on the router, not the main app
128:     @router.get("/items/")
129:     async def read_items():
130:       # A simple example returning a list of items
131:       return [{"name": "Item Foo"}, {"name": "Item Bar"}]
132: 
133:     @router.get("/items/{item_id}")
134:     async def read_item(item_id: str):
135:       # We'll learn about path parameters like {item_id} later!
136:       # See [Path Operations & Parameter Declaration](02_path_operations___parameter_declaration.md)
137:       return {"item_id": item_id, "name": f"Item {item_id}"}
138:     ```
139: 
140:     **Explanation:**
141:     *   `from fastapi import APIRouter`: We import `APIRouter`.
142:     *   `router = APIRouter()`: We create an instance of `APIRouter`.
143:     *   `@router.get("/items/")`: Notice we use `@router.get` instead of `@app.get`. We are defining this route *on the router*.
144: 
145: 3.  **Modify `main.py` to include the router:**
146: 
147:     ```python
148:     # main.py
149:     from fastapi import FastAPI
150:     from routers import items  # Import the items router
151: 
152:     # Create the main FastAPI application
153:     app = FastAPI()
154: 
155:     # Include the router from the items module
156:     # All routes defined in items.router will now be part of the main app
157:     app.include_router(items.router)
158: 
159:     # You can still define routes directly on the app if needed
160:     @app.get("/")
161:     async def read_root():
162:       return {"message": "Hello Main App!"}
163: 
164:     ```
165: 
166:     **Explanation:**
167:     *   `from routers import items`: We import the `items` module (which contains our `items.py` file).
168:     *   `app.include_router(items.router)`: This is the crucial line! It tells the main `app` to incorporate all the routes defined in `items.router`. Now, requests to `/items/` and `/items/{item_id}` will be handled correctly.
169: 
170: Now, if you run `uvicorn main:app --reload` again:
171: 
172: *   Visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` still shows `{"message":"Hello Main App!"}`.
173: *   Visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/` will show `[{"name":"Item Foo"},{"name":"Item Bar"}]`.
174: *   Visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/abc` will show `{"item_id":"abc","name":"Item abc"}`. (We'll cover `{item_id}` properly in the [next chapter](02_path_operations___parameter_declaration.md)).
175: 
176: Using `APIRouter` helps keep your project organized as it grows!
177: 
178: ## How it Works Under the Hood (Simplified)
179: 
180: What actually happens when you visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`?
181: 
182: 1.  **Browser Request:** Your browser sends an HTTP `GET` request to the address `127.0.0.1` on port `8000`, asking for the path `/`.
183: 2.  **Uvicorn Receives:** The Uvicorn server is listening on that address and port. It receives the raw request.
184: 3.  **Uvicorn to FastAPI:** Uvicorn understands the ASGI standard, which is how it communicates with FastAPI. It passes the request details (method=`GET`, path=`/`, headers, etc.) to your `FastAPI` `app` instance.
185: 4.  **FastAPI Routing:** Your `FastAPI` application (`app`) looks at its internal list of routes. This list was built when you used decorators like `@app.get("/")` or included routers like `app.include_router(items.router)`.
186: 5.  **Match Found:** FastAPI finds a route that matches:
187:     *   HTTP Method: `GET`
188:     *   Path: `/`
189:     It sees that this route is connected to your `read_root` function.
190: 6.  **Function Execution:** FastAPI calls your `async def read_root()` function.
191: 7.  **Function Returns:** Your function runs and returns the Python dictionary `{"message": "Hello World"}`.
192: 8.  **Response Processing:** FastAPI takes the returned dictionary. Because the route didn't specify a different response type, FastAPI automatically converts the dictionary into a JSON string. It also creates the necessary HTTP headers (like `Content-Type: application/json`).
193: 9.  **FastAPI to Uvicorn:** FastAPI sends the complete HTTP response (status code 200 OK, headers, JSON body) back to Uvicorn.
194: 10. **Uvicorn to Browser:** Uvicorn sends the response over the network back to your browser.
195: 11. **Browser Displays:** Your browser receives the response, sees it's JSON, and displays it.
196: 
197: Here's a diagram showing the flow:
198: 
199: ```mermaid
200: sequenceDiagram
201:     participant User Browser
202:     participant ASGI Server (Uvicorn)
203:     participant FastAPI App

205: 
206:     User Browser->>+ASGI Server (Uvicorn): GET / HTTP/1.1
207:     ASGI Server (Uvicorn)->>+FastAPI App: Pass Request (method='GET', path='/')
208:     FastAPI App->>FastAPI App: Lookup route for GET /
209:     FastAPI App->>+Route Handler (read_root): Call async def read_root()
210:     Route Handler (read_root)-->>-FastAPI App: Return {"message": "Hello World"}
211:     FastAPI App->>FastAPI App: Convert dict to JSON Response (status 200)
212:     FastAPI App-->>-ASGI Server (Uvicorn): Send HTTP Response
213:     ASGI Server (Uvicorn)-->>-User Browser: HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{"message":"Hello World"}
214: ```
215: 
216: Internally, FastAPI uses (and builds upon) the routing capabilities of the Starlette framework. When you use `@app.get()` or `@router.get()`, these functions register the path, method, and your handler function into a list of `Route` objects (defined conceptually in `fastapi/routing.py` and `starlette/routing.py`). When `app.include_router()` is called, the routes from the router are added to the main app's list, often with a path prefix if specified. When a request arrives, FastAPI iterates through this list, performs pattern matching on the path, checks the method, and calls the first matching handler.
217: 
218: ## Conclusion
219: 
220: You've taken your first steps into the world of FastAPI!
221: 
222: *   You learned that the `FastAPI` class is the core of your application, like a central control tower.
223: *   You saw how to define **routes** using decorators like `@app.get("/")` to connect URL paths and HTTP methods to your Python functions.
224: *   You wrote and ran your first simple "Hello World" API using `uvicorn`.
225: *   You discovered `APIRouter` as a way to organize your routes into logical groups (like chapters or terminals), making your code cleaner as your project grows.
226: 
227: You now have the fundamental building blocks to create web APIs. In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into defining routes, specifically how to handle data that comes *in* the URL path itself.

  8: # Chapter 2: Path Operations & Parameter Declaration
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 1: FastAPI Application & Routing](01_fastapi_application___routing.md), we learned how to set up a basic FastAPI application and organize our code using `APIRouter`. We saw how to connect a URL like `/` to a Python function using `@app.get("/")`.
 11: 
 12: But what if we need more information from the user? Imagine you're building an API for an online store. You don't just want a single "hello" page; you want users to be able to:
 13: 
 14: 1.  Get information about a *specific* item, like `/items/5` (where 5 is the item ID).
 15: 2.  Search or filter items, like `/items/?query=socks` (search for "socks").
 16: 3.  Add a *new* item by sending its details (name, price, etc.).
 17: 
 18: How do we tell FastAPI to expect this extra information (like the item ID `5`, the search query `"socks"`, or the new item's details) and make it available inside our Python function?
 19: 
 20: That's exactly what **Path Operations** and **Parameter Declaration** are for!
 21: 
 22: **Our Goal Today:** Learn how FastAPI uses function parameters and type hints to automatically handle data coming from different parts of the web request (URL path, query string, request body) and even validate it!
 23: 
 24: ## What Problem Does This Solve?
 25: 
 26: Think of your API endpoint (like `/items/`) as a specific room in a building. To get into the room or ask for something specific within it, you often need to provide information:
 27: 
 28: *   Maybe the room number is part of the address (`/items/10` - room number 10). This is like a **Path Parameter**.
 29: *   Maybe you need to fill out a small form asking optional questions ("Any specific colour?", "Sort by price?"). This is like **Query Parameters**.
 30: *   Maybe you need to hand over a detailed document with instructions or data (like the specs for a new item). This is like the **Request Body**.
 31: 
 32: FastAPI needs a way to understand these different types of information, extract them from the incoming request, check if they are the correct type (e.g., is the item ID *really* a number?), and give them to your Python function in a clean, easy-to-use way. It does this magic using standard Python type hints and special functions we'll learn about.
 33: 
 34: ## Path Operations: More Than Just GET
 35: 
 36: In Chapter 1, we used `@app.get("/")`. The `get` part refers to the HTTP **method**. Browsers use `GET` when you simply visit a URL. But there are other common methods for different actions:
 37: 
 38: *   `GET`: Retrieve data.
 39: *   `POST`: Create new data.
 40: *   `PUT`: Update existing data completely.
 41: *   `PATCH`: Partially update existing data.
 42: *   `DELETE`: Remove data.
 43: 
 44: FastAPI provides decorators for all these: `@app.post()`, `@app.put()`, `@app.patch()`, `@app.delete()`. You use them just like `@app.get()` to link a path and an HTTP method to your function.
 45: 
 46: ```python
 47: # main.py (continuing from Chapter 1, maybe add this to routers/items.py)
 48: from fastapi import FastAPI
 49: 
 50: app = FastAPI()
 51: 
 52: # A GET operation (read)
 53: @app.get("/items/")
 54: async def read_items():
 55:     return [{"item_id": 1, "name": "Thingamajig"}]
 56: 
 57: # A POST operation (create)
 58: @app.post("/items/")
 59: async def create_item():
 60:     # We'll see how to get data *into* here later
 61:     return {"message": "Item received!"} # Placeholder
 62: 
 63: # We'll focus on GET for now, but others work similarly!
 64: ```
 65: 
 66: **Explanation:**
 67: 
 68: *   We define different functions for different *actions* on the same path (`/items/`).
 69: *   `@app.get("/items/")` handles requests to *get* the list of items.
 70: *   `@app.post("/items/")` handles requests to *create* a new item. FastAPI knows which function to call based on the HTTP method used in the request.
 71: 
 72: ## Path Parameters: Getting Data from the URL Path
 73: 
 74: Let's say you want an endpoint to get a *single* item by its ID. The URL might look like `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5`. Here, `5` is the ID we want to capture.
 75: 
 76: You define this in FastAPI by putting the variable name in curly braces `{}` within the path string:
 77: 
 78: ```python
 79: # main.py or routers/items.py
 80: from fastapi import FastAPI
 81: 
 82: app = FastAPI() # Or use your APIRouter
 83: 
 84: @app.get("/items/{item_id}")  # Path parameter defined here
 85: async def read_item(item_id: int): # Parameter name MUST match! Type hint is key!
 86:     # FastAPI automatically converts the 'item_id' from the path (which is a string)
 87:     # into an integer because of the 'int' type hint.
 88:     # It also validates if it *can* be converted to an int.
 89:     return {"item_id": item_id, "name": f"Item {item_id} Name"}
 90: 
 91: ```
 92: 
 93: **Explanation:**
 94: 
 95: *   `@app.get("/items/{item_id}")`: The `{item_id}` part tells FastAPI: "Expect some value here in the URL path, and call it `item_id`."
 96: *   `async def read_item(item_id: int)`:
 97:     *   We declare a function parameter named **exactly** `item_id`. FastAPI connects the path variable to this function argument.
 98:     *   We use the Python type hint `: int`. This is crucial! FastAPI uses this to:
 99:         1.  **Convert:** The value from the URL (`"5"`) is automatically converted to an integer (`5`).
100:         2.  **Validate:** If you visit `/items/foo`, FastAPI knows `"foo"` cannot be converted to an `int`, and it automatically returns a helpful error response *before* your function even runs!
101: 
102: **Try it:**
103: 
104: 1.  Run `uvicorn main:app --reload`.
105: 2.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5`. You should see:
106:     ```json
107:     {"item_id":5,"name":"Item 5 Name"}
108:     ```
109: 3.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/abc`. You should see an error like:
110:     ```json
111:     {
112:       "detail": [
113:         {
114:           "type": "int_parsing",
115:           "loc": [
116:             "path",
117:             "item_id"
118:           ],
119:           "msg": "Input should be a valid integer, unable to parse string as an integer",
120:           "input": "abc",
121:           "url": "..."
122:         }
123:       ]
124:     }
125:     ```
126:     See? Automatic validation!
127: 
128: Path parameters are *required* parts of the path. The URL simply won't match the route if that part is missing.
129: 
130: ## Query Parameters: Optional Info After "?"
131: 
132: What if you want to provide optional filtering or configuration in the URL? Like getting items, but maybe skipping the first 10 and limiting the results to 5: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/?skip=10&limit=5`.
133: 
134: These `key=value` pairs after the `?` are called **Query Parameters**.
135: 
136: In FastAPI, you declare them as function parameters that are *not* part of the path string. You can provide default values to make them optional.
137: 
138: ```python
139: # main.py or routers/items.py
140: from fastapi import FastAPI
141: 
142: app = FastAPI() # Or use your APIRouter
143: 
144: # A simple fake database of items
145: fake_items_db = [{"item_name": "Foo"}, {"item_name": "Bar"}, {"item_name": "Baz"}]
146: 
147: @app.get("/items/")
148: # 'skip' and 'limit' are NOT in the path "/items/"
149: # They have default values, making them optional query parameters
150: async def read_items(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10):
151:     # FastAPI automatically gets 'skip' and 'limit' from the query string.
152:     # If they are not provided in the URL, it uses the defaults (0 and 10).
153:     # It also converts them to integers and validates them!
154:     return fake_items_db[skip : skip + limit]
155: 
156: ```
157: 
158: **Explanation:**
159: 
160: *   `async def read_items(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10)`:
161:     *   `skip` and `limit` are *not* mentioned in `@app.get("/items/")`. FastAPI knows they must be query parameters.
162:     *   They have default values (`= 0`, `= 10`). This makes them optional. If the user doesn't provide them in the URL, these defaults are used.
163:     *   The type hints `: int` ensure automatic conversion and validation, just like with path parameters.
164: 
165: **Try it:**
166: 
167: 1.  Make sure `uvicorn` is running.
168: 2.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/`. Result (uses defaults `skip=0`, `limit=10`):
169:     ```json
170:     [{"item_name":"Foo"},{"item_name":"Bar"},{"item_name":"Baz"}]
171:     ```
172: 3.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/?skip=1&limit=1`. Result:
173:     ```json
174:     [{"item_name":"Bar"}]
175:     ```
176: 4.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/?limit=abc`. Result: Automatic validation error because `abc` is not an integer.
177: 
178: You can also declare query parameters without default values. In that case, they become *required* query parameters.
179: 
180: ```python
181: # Example: Required query parameter 'query_str'
182: @app.get("/search/")
183: async def search_items(query_str: str): # No default value means it's required
184:     return {"search_query": query_str}
185: 
186: # Visiting /search/ will cause an error
187: # Visiting /search/?query_str=hello will work
188: ```
189: 
190: You can also use other types like `bool` or `float`, and even optional types like `str | None = None` (or `Optional[str] = None` in older Python).
191: 
192: ```python
193: @app.get("/users/{user_id}/items")
194: async def read_user_items(
195:     user_id: int,                 # Path parameter
196:     show_details: bool = False,   # Optional query parameter (e.g., ?show_details=true)
197:     category: str | None = None # Optional query parameter (e.g., ?category=books)
198: ):
199:     # ... function logic ...
200:     return {"user_id": user_id, "show_details": show_details, "category": category}
201: ```
202: 
203: ## Request Body: Sending Complex Data
204: 
205: Sometimes, the data you need to send is too complex for the URL path or query string (like the name, description, price, tax, and tags for a new item). For `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests, data is usually sent in the **Request Body**, often as JSON.
206: 
207: FastAPI uses **Pydantic models** to define the structure of the data you expect in the request body. We'll dive deep into Pydantic in [Chapter 3: Data Validation & Serialization (Pydantic)](03_data_validation___serialization__pydantic_.md), but here's a sneak peek:
208: 
209: ```python
210: # main.py or a new models.py file
211: from pydantic import BaseModel
212: 
213: # Define the structure of an Item using Pydantic
214: class Item(BaseModel):
215:     name: str
216:     description: str | None = None # Optional field
217:     price: float
218:     tax: float | None = None       # Optional field
219: 
220: # Now use it in a path operation
221: # main.py or routers/items.py
222: from fastapi import FastAPI
223: # Assume Item is defined as above (maybe import it)
224: 
225: app = FastAPI() # Or use your APIRouter
226: 
227: @app.post("/items/")
228: async def create_item(item: Item): # Declare the body parameter using the Pydantic model
229:     # FastAPI automatically:
230:     # 1. Reads the request body.
231:     # 2. Parses the JSON data.
232:     # 3. Validates the data against the 'Item' model (Are 'name' and 'price' present? Are types correct?).
233:     # 4. If valid, provides the data as the 'item' argument (an instance of the Item class).
234:     # 5. If invalid, returns an automatic validation error.
235:     print(f"Received item: {item.name}, Price: {item.price}")
236:     item_dict = item.model_dump() # Convert Pydantic model back to dict if needed
237:     if item.tax:
238:         price_with_tax = item.price + item.tax
239:         item_dict["price_with_tax"] = price_with_tax
240:     return item_dict
241: ```
242: 
243: **Explanation:**
244: 
245: *   `class Item(BaseModel): ...`: We define a class `Item` that inherits from Pydantic's `BaseModel`. We declare the expected fields (`name`, `description`, `price`, `tax`) and their types.
246: *   `async def create_item(item: Item)`: We declare a *single* parameter `item` with the type hint `Item`. Because `Item` is a Pydantic model, FastAPI knows it should expect this data in the **request body** as JSON.
247: *   FastAPI handles all the parsing and validation. If the incoming JSON doesn't match the `Item` structure, the client gets an error. If it matches, your function receives a ready-to-use `item` object.
248: 
249: You typically use request bodies for `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests. You can only declare *one* body parameter per function (though that body can contain nested structures, as defined by your Pydantic model).
250: 
251: ## Fine-tuning Parameters with `Path`, `Query`, `Body`, etc.
252: 
253: Type hints are great for basic validation (like `int`, `str`, `bool`). But what if you need more specific rules?
254: 
255: *   The `item_id` must be greater than 0.
256: *   A query parameter `q` should have a maximum length of 50 characters.
257: *   A `description` in the request body should have a minimum length.
258: 
259: FastAPI provides functions like `Path`, `Query`, `Body`, `Header`, `Cookie`, and `File` (imported directly from `fastapi`) that you can use alongside type hints (using `typing.Annotated`) to add these extra validation rules and metadata.
260: 
261: Let's enhance our previous examples:
262: 
263: ```python
264: # main.py or routers/items.py
265: from typing import Annotated # Use Annotated for extra metadata
266: from fastapi import FastAPI, Path, Query
267: # Assume Item Pydantic model is defined/imported
268: 
269: app = FastAPI() # Or use your APIRouter
270: 
271: # Fake DB
272: fake_items_db = [{"item_name": "Foo"}, {"item_name": "Bar"}, {"item_name": "Baz"}]
273: 
274: @app.get("/items/{item_id}")
275: async def read_item(
276:     # Use Annotated[type, Path(...)] for path parameters
277:     item_id: Annotated[int, Path(
278:         title="The ID of the item to get",
279:         description="The item ID must be a positive integer.",
280:         gt=0,  # gt = Greater Than 0
281:         le=1000 # le = Less Than or Equal to 1000
282:     )]
283: ):
284:     return {"item_id": item_id, "name": f"Item {item_id} Name"}
285: 
286: 
287: @app.get("/items/")
288: async def read_items(
289:     # Use Annotated[type | None, Query(...)] for optional query parameters
290:     q: Annotated[str | None, Query(
291:         title="Query string",
292:         description="Optional query string to search items.",
293:         min_length=3,
294:         max_length=50
295:     )] = None, # Default value still makes it optional
296:     skip: Annotated[int, Query(ge=0)] = 0, # ge = Greater Than or Equal to 0
297:     limit: Annotated[int, Query(gt=0, le=100)] = 10
298: ):
299:     results = fake_items_db[skip : skip + limit]
300:     if q:
301:         results = [item for item in results if q.lower() in item["item_name"].lower()]
302:     return results
303: 
304: # Using Body works similarly, often used inside Pydantic models (Chapter 3)
305: # or if you need to embed a single body parameter
306: @app.post("/items/")
307: async def create_item(item: Item): # Pydantic model handles body structure
308:     # Validation for item fields is defined within the Item model itself (See Chapter 3)
309:     # For simple body params without Pydantic, you might use:
310:     # importance: Annotated[int, Body(gt=0)]
311:     return item
312: ```
313: 
314: **Explanation:**
315: 
316: *   **`Annotated`**: This is the standard Python way (Python 3.9+) to add extra context to type hints. FastAPI uses this to associate `Path`, `Query`, etc., with your parameters.
317: *   **`Path(...)`**: Used for path parameters.
318:     *   `title`, `description`: Add metadata that will appear in the automatic documentation (see [Chapter 4](04_openapi___automatic_docs.md)).
319:     *   `gt`, `ge`, `lt`, `le`: Numeric validation (greater than, greater than or equal, less than, less than or equal).
320: *   **`Query(...)`**: Used for query parameters.
321:     *   Takes similar arguments to `Path` for metadata and numeric validation.
322:     *   `min_length`, `max_length`: String length validation.
323:     *   The default value (`= None`, `= 0`, `= 10`) still determines if the parameter is optional or required.
324: *   **`Body(...)`**: Used for request body parameters (often implicitly handled by Pydantic models). Can add metadata or validation similar to `Query`.
325: *   **Others**: `Header()`, `Cookie()`, `File()` work similarly for data from request headers, cookies, or uploaded files.
326: 
327: Using `Path`, `Query`, etc., gives you fine-grained control over data validation and adds useful information to your API documentation automatically.
328: 
329: ## How it Works Under the Hood (Simplified)
330: 
331: How does FastAPI magically connect URL parts and request data to your function arguments and validate them?
332: 
333: 1.  **App Startup:** When you run your app, FastAPI (using Starlette's routing) inspects all the functions decorated with `@app.get`, `@app.post`, etc.
334: 2.  **Function Signature Inspection:** For each function, FastAPI looks at its parameters (`item_id`, `skip`, `limit`, `item`, `q`).
335: 3.  **Parameter Type Analysis:** It checks the type hints (`int`, `str`, `bool`, `Item`, `Annotated[...]`).
336: 4.  **Location Determination:**
337:     *   If a parameter name matches a variable in the path string (`{item_id}`), it's a **Path Parameter**.
338:     *   If a parameter has a type hint that's a Pydantic model (`item: Item`), it's a **Body Parameter**.
339:     *   Otherwise, it's a **Query Parameter** (`skip`, `limit`, `q`).
340:     *   If `Annotated` is used with `Path`, `Query`, `Body`, `Header`, `Cookie`, or `File`, that explicitly defines the location and adds extra validation rules.
341: 5.  **Request Arrives:** A request comes in (e.g., `GET /items/5?q=search`).
342: 6.  **Routing:** Uvicorn passes the request to FastAPI. FastAPI/Starlette matches the path (`/items/5`) and method (`GET`) to the `read_item` function (or `read_items` if the path was `/items/`). Let's assume it matches `read_item` for `/items/{item_id}`.
343: 7.  **Data Extraction:** FastAPI extracts data from the request based on the parameter definitions found in step 4:
344:     *   Path: Extracts `"5"` for `item_id`.
345:     *   Query: Extracts `"search"` for `q` (if the route was `/items/` and the function `read_items`).
346:     *   Body: Reads and parses JSON (if it was a POST/PUT request with a body parameter).
347: 8.  **Validation & Conversion:** FastAPI uses the type hints and any extra rules from `Path`, `Query`, `Body` (often leveraging Pydantic internally):
348:     *   Converts `"5"` to the integer `5` for `item_id`. Checks `gt=0`.
349:     *   Converts `"search"` to a string for `q`. Checks `max_length`.
350:     *   Validates the JSON body against the `Item` model.
351: 9.  **Error Handling:** If any validation or conversion fails, FastAPI *immediately* stops and sends back a 422 "Unprocessable Entity" error response with details about what went wrong. Your function is *not* called.
352: 10. **Function Call:** If everything is valid, FastAPI calls your function (`read_item` or `read_items`) with the extracted, converted, and validated data as arguments (`read_item(item_id=5)` or `read_items(q="search", skip=0, limit=10)`).
353: 11. **Response:** Your function runs and returns a result. FastAPI processes the result into an HTTP response.
354: 
355: Here's a simplified diagram for a `GET /items/5?limit=10` request:
356: 
357: ```mermaid

375:     Route Handler (read_item)-->>-FastAPI App: Return {"item_id": 5, ...}

377:     FastAPI App-->>-ASGI Server (Uvicorn): Send HTTP Response
378:     ASGI Server (Uvicorn)-->>-Client: HTTP 200 OK Response
379: ```
380: 
381: FastAPI cleverly uses Python's type hinting system, Pydantic, and Starlette's request handling to automate the tedious tasks of parsing, validation, and documentation.
382: 
383: ## Conclusion
384: 
385: You've now learned the core mechanics of defining API endpoints (Path Operations) and extracting data from requests in FastAPI!
386: 
387: *   You know how to use decorators like `@app.get`, `@app.post` for different HTTP methods.
388: *   You can define **Path Parameters** using `{}` in the path string and matching function arguments with type hints (`item_id: int`).
389: *   You can define **Query Parameters** using function arguments *not* in the path, making them optional with default values (`skip: int = 0`).
390: *   You understand the basics of receiving JSON **Request Bodies** using Pydantic models (`item: Item`).
391: *   You saw how to add extra validation and metadata using `Annotated` with `Path()`, `Query()`, and `Body()`.
392: *   You got a glimpse of how FastAPI uses type hints and these tools to automatically parse, validate, and document your API parameters.
393: 
394: This powerful parameter declaration system is a cornerstone of FastAPI's ease of use and robustness. In the next chapter, we'll explore Pydantic models in much more detail, unlocking even more powerful data validation and serialization capabilities for your request bodies and responses.

  8: # Chapter 3: Data Validation & Serialization (Pydantic)
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 2: Path Operations & Parameter Declaration](02_path_operations___parameter_declaration.md), we learned how FastAPI uses type hints to understand path parameters (like `/items/{item_id}`) and query parameters (like `/?skip=0&limit=10`). We even saw a sneak peek of how Pydantic models can define the structure of a JSON request body.
 11: 
 12: Now, let's dive deep into that magic! How does FastAPI *really* handle complex data coming into your API and the data you send back?
 13: 
 14: **Our Goal Today:** Understand how FastAPI uses the powerful **Pydantic** library to automatically validate incoming data (making sure it's correct) and serialize outgoing data (converting it to JSON).
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Does This Solve?
 17: 
 18: Imagine you're building the API for an online store, specifically the part where a user can add a new product. They need to send you information like the product's name, price, and maybe an optional description. This information usually comes as JSON in the request body.
 19: 
 20: You need to make sure:
 21: 
 22: 1.  **The data arrived:** Did the user actually send the product details?
 23: 2.  **It has the right shape:** Does the JSON contain a `name` and a `price`? Is the `description` there, or is it okay if it's missing?
 24: 3.  **It has the right types:** Is the `name` a string? Is the `price` a number (like a float or decimal)?
 25: 4.  **It meets certain rules (optional):** Maybe the price must be positive? Maybe the name can't be empty?
 26: 
 27: Doing these checks manually for every API endpoint would be tedious and error-prone.
 28: 
 29: Similarly, when you send data *back* (like the details of the newly created product), you need to convert your internal Python objects (like dictionaries or custom class instances) into standard JSON that the user's browser or application can understand. You might also want to control *which* information gets sent back (e.g., maybe hide internal cost fields).
 30: 
 31: **FastAPI solves both problems using Pydantic:**
 32: 
 33: *   **Validation (Gatekeeper):** Pydantic models act like strict blueprints or forms. You define the expected structure and types of incoming data using a Pydantic model. FastAPI uses this model to automatically parse the incoming JSON, check if it matches the blueprint (validate it), and provide you with a clean Python object. If the data doesn't match, FastAPI automatically sends back a clear error message saying exactly what's wrong. Think of it as a meticulous gatekeeper checking IDs and forms at the entrance.
 34: *   **Serialization (Translator):** When you return data from your API function, FastAPI can use a Pydantic model (specified as a `response_model`) or its built-in `jsonable_encoder` to convert your Python objects (Pydantic models, database objects, dictionaries, etc.) into JSON format. Think of it as a helpful translator converting your application's internal language into the common language of JSON for the outside world.
 35: 
 36: ## Your First Pydantic Model
 37: 
 38: Pydantic models are simply Python classes that inherit from `pydantic.BaseModel`. You define the "fields" of your data as class attributes with type hints.
 39: 
 40: Let's define a model for our product item:
 41: 
 42: 1.  **Create a file (optional but good practice):** You could put this in a file like `models.py`.
 43: 2.  **Write the model:**
 44: 
 45: ```python
 46: # models.py (or within your main.py/routers/items.py)
 47: from pydantic import BaseModel
 48: 
 49: class Item(BaseModel):
 50:     name: str
 51:     description: str | None = None  # Optional field with a default of None
 52:     price: float
 53:     tax: float | None = None        # Optional field with a default of None
 54: ```
 55: 
 56: **Explanation:**
 57: 
 58: *   `from pydantic import BaseModel`: We import the necessary `BaseModel` from Pydantic.
 59: *   `class Item(BaseModel):`: We define our model class `Item`, inheriting from `BaseModel`.
 60: *   `name: str`: We declare a field named `name`. The type hint `: str` tells Pydantic that this field is **required** and must be a string.
 61: *   `description: str | None = None`:
 62:     *   `str | None`: This type hint (using the pipe `|` operator for Union) means `description` can be either a string OR `None`.
 63:     *   `= None`: This sets the **default value** to `None`. Because it has a default value, this field is **optional**. If the incoming data doesn't include `description`, Pydantic will automatically set it to `None`.
 64: *   `price: float`: A required field that must be a floating-point number.
 65: *   `tax: float | None = None`: An optional field that can be a float or `None`, defaulting to `None`.
 66: 
 67: This simple class definition now acts as our data blueprint!
 68: 
 69: ## Using Pydantic for Request Body Validation
 70: 
 71: Now, let's use this `Item` model in a `POST` request to create a new item. We saw this briefly in Chapter 2.
 72: 
 73: ```python
 74: # main.py (or routers/items.py)
 75: from fastapi import FastAPI
 76: # Assume 'Item' model is defined above or imported: from models import Item
 77: 
 78: app = FastAPI() # Or use your APIRouter
 79: 
 80: @app.post("/items/")
 81: # Declare 'item' parameter with type hint 'Item'
 82: async def create_item(item: Item):
 83:     # If the code reaches here, FastAPI + Pydantic already did:
 84:     # 1. Read the request body (as JSON bytes).
 85:     # 2. Parsed the JSON into a Python dict.
 86:     # 3. Validated the dict against the 'Item' model.
 87:     #    - Checked required fields ('name', 'price').
 88:     #    - Checked types (name is str, price is float, etc.).
 89:     #    - Assigned default values for optional fields if missing.
 90:     # 4. Created an 'Item' instance from the valid data.
 91: 
 92:     # 'item' is now a Pydantic 'Item' object with validated data!
 93:     print(f"Received item name: {item.name}")
 94:     print(f"Received item price: {item.price}")
 95:     if item.description:
 96:         print(f"Received item description: {item.description}")
 97:     if item.tax:
 98:         print(f"Received item tax: {item.tax}")
 99: 
100:     # You can easily convert the Pydantic model back to a dict if needed
101:     item_dict = item.model_dump() # Pydantic v2 method
102: 
103:     # ... here you would typically save the item to a database ...
104: 
105:     # Return the created item's data
106:     return item_dict
107: ```
108: 
109: **Explanation:**
110: 
111: *   `async def create_item(item: Item)`: By declaring the function parameter `item` with the type hint `Item` (our Pydantic model), FastAPI automatically knows it should:
112:     *   Expect JSON in the request body.
113:     *   Validate that JSON against the `Item` model.
114: *   **Automatic Validation:** If the client sends JSON like `{"name": "Thingamajig", "price": 49.99}`, FastAPI/Pydantic validates it, creates an `Item` object (`item`), and passes it to your function. Inside your function, `item.name` will be `"Thingamajig"`, `item.price` will be `49.99`, and `item.description` and `item.tax` will be `None` (their defaults).
115: *   **Automatic Errors:** If the client sends invalid JSON, like `{"name": "Gadget"}` (missing `price`) or `{"name": "Gizmo", "price": "expensive"}` (`price` is not a float), FastAPI will **not** call your `create_item` function. Instead, it will automatically send back a `422 Unprocessable Entity` HTTP error response with a detailed JSON body explaining the validation errors.
116: 
117: **Example 422 Error Response (if `price` was missing):**
118: 
119: ```json
120: {
121:   "detail": [
122:     {
123:       "type": "missing",
124:       "loc": [
125:         "body",
126:         "price"
127:       ],
128:       "msg": "Field required",
129:       "input": { // The invalid data received
130:         "name": "Gadget"
131:       },
132:       "url": "..." // Pydantic v2 URL to error details
133:     }
134:   ]
135: }
136: ```
137: 
138: This automatic validation saves you a *ton* of boilerplate code and provides clear feedback to API consumers.
139: 
140: ## Using Pydantic for Response Serialization (`response_model`)
141: 
142: We just saw how Pydantic validates *incoming* data. It's also incredibly useful for shaping *outgoing* data.
143: 
144: Let's say when we create an item, we want to return the item's data, but maybe we have some internal fields in our Pydantic model that we *don't* want to expose in the API response. Or, we just want to be absolutely sure the response *always* conforms to the `Item` structure.
145: 
146: We can use the `response_model` parameter in the path operation decorator:
147: 
148: ```python
149: # main.py (or routers/items.py, modified version)
150: from fastapi import FastAPI
151: from pydantic import BaseModel # Assuming Item is defined here or imported
152: 
153: # Let's add an internal field to our model for demonstration
154: class Item(BaseModel):
155:     name: str
156:     description: str | None = None
157:     price: float
158:     tax: float | None = None
159:     internal_cost: float = 0.0 # Field we DON'T want in the response
160: 
161: app = FastAPI() # Or use your APIRouter
162: 
163: # Add response_model=Item to the decorator
164: @app.post("/items/", response_model=Item)
165: async def create_item(item: Item):
166:     # item is the validated input Item object
167:     print(f"Processing item: {item.name} with internal cost {item.internal_cost}")
168: 
169:     # ... save item to database ...
170: 
171:     # Let's imagine we return the same item object we received
172:     # (in reality, you might return an object fetched from the DB)
173:     return item # FastAPI will handle serialization based on response_model
174: ```
175: 
176: **Explanation:**
177: 
178: *   `@app.post("/items/", response_model=Item)`: By adding `response_model=Item`, we tell FastAPI:
179:     1.  **Filter:** Whatever data is returned by the `create_item` function, filter it so that only the fields defined in the `Item` model (`name`, `description`, `price`, `tax`, `internal_cost`) are included in the final JSON response. **Wait!** Actually, Pydantic V2 by default includes all fields from the returned object *that are also in the response model*. In this case, since we return `item` which *is* an `Item` instance, all fields (`name`, `description`, `price`, `tax`, `internal_cost`) would be included *if* the returned object *was* an `Item` instance. *Correction:* Let's refine the example to show filtering. Let's define a *different* response model.
180: 
181: ```python
182: # models.py
183: from pydantic import BaseModel
184: 
185: # Input model (can include internal fields)
186: class ItemCreate(BaseModel):
187:     name: str
188:     description: str | None = None
189:     price: float
190:     tax: float | None = None
191:     internal_cost: float # Required input, but we won't return it
192: 
193: # Output model (defines what the client sees)
194: class ItemPublic(BaseModel):
195:     name: str
196:     description: str | None = None
197:     price: float
198:     tax: float | None = None
199:     # Note: internal_cost is NOT defined here
200: 
201: # ---- In main.py or routers/items.py ----
202: from fastapi import FastAPI
203: from models import ItemCreate, ItemPublic # Import both models
204: 
205: app = FastAPI()
206: 
207: items_db = [] # Simple in-memory "database"
208: 
209: @app.post("/items/", response_model=ItemPublic) # Use ItemPublic for response
210: async def create_item(item_input: ItemCreate): # Use ItemCreate for input
211:     print(f"Received internal cost: {item_input.internal_cost}")
212: 
213:     # Convert input model to a dict (or create DB model instance)
214:     item_data = item_input.model_dump()
215: 
216:     # Simulate saving to DB and getting back the saved data
217:     # In a real app, the DB might assign an ID, etc.
218:     saved_item_data = item_data.copy()
219:     saved_item_data["id"] = len(items_db) + 1 # Add a simulated ID
220:     items_db.append(saved_item_data)
221: 
222:     # Return the *dictionary* of saved data. FastAPI will use response_model
223:     # ItemPublic to filter and serialize this dictionary.
224:     return saved_item_data
225: ```
226: 
227: **Explanation (Revised):**
228: 
229: *   `ItemCreate`: Defines the structure we expect for *creating* an item, including `internal_cost`.
230: *   `ItemPublic`: Defines the structure we want to *return* to the client, notably *excluding* `internal_cost`.
231: *   `create_item(item_input: ItemCreate)`: We accept the full `ItemCreate` model as input.
232: *   `@app.post("/items/", response_model=ItemPublic)`: We declare that the response should conform to the `ItemPublic` model.
233: *   `return saved_item_data`: We return a Python dictionary containing all fields (including `internal_cost` and the simulated `id`).
234: *   **Automatic Filtering & Serialization:** FastAPI takes the returned dictionary (`saved_item_data`). Because `response_model=ItemPublic` is set, it does the following *before* sending the response:
235:     1.  It looks at the fields defined in `ItemPublic` (`name`, `description`, `price`, `tax`).
236:     2.  It takes only those fields from the `saved_item_data` dictionary. The `internal_cost` and `id` fields are automatically dropped because they are not in `ItemPublic`.
237:     3.  It ensures the values for the included fields match the types expected by `ItemPublic` (this also provides some output validation).
238:     4.  It converts the resulting filtered data into a JSON string using `jsonable_encoder` internally.
239: 
240: **Example Interaction:**
241: 
242: 1.  **Client sends `POST /items/` with body:**
243:     ```json
244:     {
245:       "name": "Super Gadget",
246:       "price": 120.50,
247:       "internal_cost": 55.25,
248:       "description": "The best gadget ever!"
249:     }
250:     ```
251: 2.  **FastAPI:** Validates this against `ItemCreate` (Success).
252: 3.  **`create_item` function:** Runs, prints `internal_cost`, prepares `saved_item_data` dictionary.
253: 4.  **FastAPI (Response processing):** Takes the returned dictionary, filters it using `ItemPublic`.
254: 5.  **Client receives `200 OK` with body:**
255:     ```json
256:     {
257:       "name": "Super Gadget",
258:       "description": "The best gadget ever!",
259:       "price": 120.50,
260:       "tax": null
261:     }
262:     ```
263:     Notice `internal_cost` and `id` are gone!
264: 
265: The `response_model` gives you precise control over your API's output contract, enhancing security and clarity.
266: 
267: ## How it Works Under the Hood (Simplified)
268: 
269: Let's trace the journey of a `POST /items/` request using our `ItemCreate` input model and `ItemPublic` response model.
270: 
271: 1.  **Request In:** Client sends `POST /items/` with JSON body to the Uvicorn server.
272: 2.  **FastAPI Routing:** Uvicorn passes the request to FastAPI. FastAPI matches the path and method to our `create_item` function.
273: 3.  **Parameter Analysis:** FastAPI inspects `create_item(item_input: ItemCreate)`. It sees `item_input` is type-hinted with a Pydantic model (`ItemCreate`), so it knows to look for the data in the request body.
274: 4.  **Body Reading & Parsing:** FastAPI reads the raw bytes from the request body and attempts to parse them as JSON into a Python dictionary. If JSON parsing fails, an error is returned.
275: 5.  **Pydantic Validation:** FastAPI passes the parsed dictionary to Pydantic, essentially calling `ItemCreate.model_validate(parsed_dict)`.
276:     *   **Success:** Pydantic checks types, required fields, etc. If valid, it returns a populated `ItemCreate` instance.
277:     *   **Failure:** Pydantic raises a `ValidationError`. FastAPI catches this.
278: 6.  **Error Handling (if validation failed):** FastAPI converts the Pydantic `ValidationError` into a user-friendly JSON response (status code 422) and sends it back immediately. The `create_item` function is *never called*.
279: 7.  **Function Execution (if validation succeeded):** FastAPI calls `create_item(item_input=<ItemCreate instance>)`. Your function logic runs.
280: 8.  **Return Value:** Your function returns a value (e.g., the `saved_item_data` dictionary).
281: 9.  **Response Model Processing:** FastAPI sees `response_model=ItemPublic` in the decorator.
282: 10. **Filtering/Validation:** FastAPI uses the `ItemPublic` model to filter the returned dictionary (`saved_item_data`), keeping only fields defined in `ItemPublic`. It may also perform type coercion/validation based on `ItemPublic`.
283: 11. **Serialization (`jsonable_encoder`):** FastAPI passes the filtered data to `jsonable_encoder`. This function recursively walks through the data, converting Pydantic models, `datetime` objects, `UUID`s, Decimals, etc., into basic JSON-compatible types (strings, numbers, booleans, lists, dicts, null).
284: 12. **Response Out:** FastAPI creates the final HTTP response with the correct status code, headers (`Content-Type: application/json`), and the JSON string body. Uvicorn sends this back to the client.
285: 
286: Here's a diagram summarizing the flow:

320:     end
321: ```
322: 
323: ## Internal Code Connections
324: 
325: While FastAPI hides the complexity, here's roughly where things happen:
326: 
327: *   **Model Definition:** You use `pydantic.BaseModel`.
328: *   **Parameter Analysis:** FastAPI's `fastapi.dependencies.utils.analyze_param` identifies parameters type-hinted with Pydantic models as potential body parameters.
329: *   **Request Body Handling:** `fastapi.dependencies.utils.request_body_to_args` coordinates reading, parsing, and validation (using Pydantic's validation methods internally, like `model_validate` in v2).
330: *   **Validation Errors:** Pydantic raises `pydantic.ValidationError`, which FastAPI catches and handles using default exception handlers (see `fastapi.exception_handlers`) to create the 422 response.
331: *   **Response Serialization:** The `fastapi.routing.APIRoute` class handles the `response_model`. If present, it uses it to process the return value before passing it to `fastapi.encoders.jsonable_encoder`.
332: *   **JSON Conversion:** `fastapi.encoders.jsonable_encoder` is the workhorse that converts various Python types into JSON-compatible formats. It knows how to handle Pydantic models (calling their `.model_dump(mode='json')` method in v2), datetimes, UUIDs, etc.
333: 
334: ## Conclusion
335: 
336: You've unlocked one of FastAPI's superpowers: seamless data validation and serialization powered by Pydantic!
337: 
338: *   You learned to define data shapes using **Pydantic models** (`BaseModel`).
339: *   You saw how FastAPI **automatically validates** incoming request bodies against these models using simple type hints in your function parameters (`item: Item`).
340: *   You learned how to use the `response_model` parameter in path operation decorators to **filter and serialize** outgoing data, ensuring your API responses have a consistent and predictable structure.
341: *   You understood the basic flow: FastAPI acts as the orchestrator, using Pydantic as the expert validator and `jsonable_encoder` as the expert translator.
342: 
343: This automatic handling drastically reduces boilerplate code, prevents common errors, and makes your API development faster and more robust.
344: 
345: But there's another huge benefit to defining your data with Pydantic models: FastAPI uses them to generate interactive API documentation automatically! Let's see how that works in the next chapter.
346: 
347: Ready to see your API document itself? Let's move on to [Chapter 4: OpenAPI & Automatic Docs](04_openapi___automatic_docs.md)!

  8: # Chapter 4: OpenAPI & Automatic Docs
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 3: Data Validation & Serialization (Pydantic)](03_data_validation___serialization__pydantic_.md), we saw how FastAPI uses Pydantic models to automatically validate incoming data and serialize outgoing data, making our API robust and predictable. But how do we tell others (or remind ourselves later) how to actually *use* our API? What endpoints exist? What data should they send? What will they get back?
 11: 
 12: **Our Goal Today:** Discover how FastAPI automatically generates API documentation that is interactive and always stays synchronized with your code, using the OpenAPI standard.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does This Solve?
 15: 
 16: Imagine you've built an amazing, complex machine – maybe a fantastic coffee maker. You know exactly how it works, which buttons to press, and where to put the beans and water. But if someone else wants to use it, or even if you forget some details after a few months, you need a **user manual**.
 17: 
 18: An API is similar. It's a way for different software components (like a web frontend and a backend server, or two different backend services) to communicate. Without a clear "manual", it's hard for developers to know:
 19: 
 20: *   What specific URLs (paths) are available? (`/items/`, `/users/{user_id}`)
 21: *   What HTTP methods can be used for each path? (`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`)
 22: *   What data needs to be sent in the URL path or query string? (`item_id`, `?q=search`)
 23: *   What data needs to be sent in the request body (often as JSON)? (`{"name": "...", "price": ...}`)
 24: *   What does the data returned by the API look like?
 25: *   How does security work?
 26: 
 27: Manually writing and updating this documentation is a chore. It's easy to make mistakes, and even easier for the documentation to become outdated as the code changes. This leads to confusion, errors, and wasted time.
 28: 
 29: FastAPI solves this beautifully by automatically generating this "manual" based directly on your Python code. It uses an industry standard called **OpenAPI**.
 30: 
 31: ## Key Concepts
 32: 
 33: ### 1. OpenAPI Specification
 34: 
 35: *   **What it is:** OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger Specification) is a standard, language-agnostic way to describe RESTful APIs. Think of it as a universal blueprint for APIs.
 36: *   **Format:** It's usually written in JSON or YAML format. This format is machine-readable, meaning tools can automatically process it.
 37: *   **Content:** An OpenAPI document details everything about your API: available paths, allowed operations (GET, POST, etc.) on those paths, expected parameters (path, query, header, cookie, body), data formats (using JSON Schema, which Pydantic models map to), security requirements, and more.
 38: 
 39: FastAPI automatically generates this OpenAPI schema for your entire application.
 40: 
 41: ### 2. Automatic Generation: From Code to Docs
 42: 
 43: How does FastAPI create this OpenAPI schema? It intelligently inspects your code:
 44: 
 45: *   **Paths and Methods:** It looks at your path operation decorators like `@app.get("/items/")`, `@app.post("/items/")`, `@app.get("/users/{user_id}")`.
 46: *   **Parameters:** It examines your function parameters, their type hints (`item_id: int`, `q: str | None = None`), and any extra information provided using `Path()`, `Query()` as seen in [Chapter 2: Path Operations & Parameter Declaration](02_path_operations___parameter_declaration.md).
 47: *   **Request Bodies:** It uses the Pydantic models you declare as type hints for request body parameters (`item: Item`) from [Chapter 3: Data Validation & Serialization (Pydantic)](03_data_validation___serialization__pydantic_.md).
 48: *   **Responses:** It uses the `response_model` you define in decorators and the status codes to describe possible responses.
 49: *   **Metadata:** It reads docstrings from your functions and metadata like `title`, `description`, `tags`, `summary`, `deprecated` that you add to your path operations or parameters.
 50: 
 51: Because the documentation is generated *from* the code, it stays **synchronized**. If you change a parameter type or add a new endpoint, the documentation updates automatically the next time you run the app!
 52: 
 53: ### 3. Interactive API Documentation UIs
 54: 
 55: Having the OpenAPI schema (the blueprint) is great, but it's just a JSON file. FastAPI goes a step further and provides two beautiful, interactive web interfaces *out-of-the-box* that use this schema:
 56: 
 57: *   **Swagger UI (at `/docs`):** This interface provides a rich, interactive environment where you can:
 58:     *   Browse all your API endpoints, grouped by tags.
 59:     *   See details for each endpoint: description, parameters, request body structure, possible responses.
 60:     *   **Try it out!** You can directly make API calls from your browser, fill in parameters, and see the actual responses. This is incredibly useful for testing and debugging.
 61: 
 62: *   **ReDoc (at `/redoc`):** This provides an alternative documentation view, often considered cleaner for pure documentation reading, presenting a three-panel layout with navigation, documentation, and code samples. It's less focused on interactive "try it out" functionality compared to Swagger UI but excellent for understanding the API structure.
 63: 
 64: ## Using the Automatic Docs
 65: 
 66: The best part? You barely have to do anything to get basic documentation! Let's use a simple example building on previous chapters.
 67: 
 68: ```python
 69: # main.py
 70: from fastapi import FastAPI, Path, Query
 71: from pydantic import BaseModel
 72: from typing import Annotated
 73: 
 74: # Define a Pydantic model (like in Chapter 3)
 75: class Item(BaseModel):
 76:     name: str
 77:     description: str | None = None
 78:     price: float
 79:     tax: float | None = None
 80: 
 81: app = FastAPI(
 82:     title="My Super API",
 83:     description="This is a very fancy API built with FastAPI",
 84:     version="1.0.0",
 85: )
 86: 
 87: # Simple in-memory storage
 88: fake_items_db = {}
 89: 
 90: @app.post("/items/", response_model=Item, tags=["Items"])
 91: async def create_item(item: Item):
 92:     """
 93:     Create a new item and store it.
 94: 
 95:     - **name**: Each item must have a name.
 96:     - **description**: A long description.
 97:     - **price**: Price must be positive.
 98:     """
 99:     item_id = len(fake_items_db) + 1
100:     fake_items_db[item_id] = item
101:     return item # Return the created item
102: 
103: @app.get("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Item, tags=["Items"])
104: async def read_item(
105:     item_id: Annotated[int, Path(
106:         title="The ID of the item to get",
107:         description="The ID of the item you want to retrieve.",
108:         gt=0
109:     )]
110: ):
111:     """
112:     Retrieve a single item by its ID.
113:     """
114:     if item_id not in fake_items_db:

116:         from fastapi import HTTPException
117:         raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
118:     return fake_items_db[item_id]
119: 
120: @app.get("/items/", tags=["Items"])
121: async def read_items(
122:     skip: Annotated[int, Query(description="Number of items to skip")] = 0,
123:     limit: Annotated[int, Query(description="Maximum number of items to return")] = 10
124: ):
125:     """
126:     Retrieve a list of items with pagination.
127:     """
128:     items = list(fake_items_db.values())
129:     return items[skip : skip + limit]
130: 
131: ```
132: 
133: **Running the App:**
134: 
135: Save this as `main.py` and run it with Uvicorn:
136: 
137: ```bash
138: uvicorn main:app --reload
139: ```
140: 
141: Now, open your web browser and go to these URLs:
142: 
143: 1.  **`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`**
144: 
145:     You'll see the **Swagger UI**:
146:     *   The API title ("My Super API"), version, and description you provided when creating `FastAPI()` are shown at the top.
147:     *   Endpoints are grouped under the "Items" tag (because we added `tags=["Items"]`).
148:     *   Expand an endpoint (e.g., `POST /items/`). You'll see:
149:         *   The description from the function's docstring (`Create a new item...`).
150:         *   A "Parameters" section (empty for this POST, but would show path/query params if present).
151:         *   A "Request body" section showing the required JSON structure based on the `Item` Pydantic model, including descriptions if you add them to the model fields.
152:         *   A "Responses" section showing the expected `200 OK` response (based on `response_model=Item`) and the automatic `422 Validation Error` response.
153:         *   A "Try it out" button! Click it, edit the example JSON body, and click "Execute" to send a real request to your running API.
154: 
155: 2.  **`http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`**
156: 
157:     You'll see the **ReDoc** interface:
158:     *   A cleaner, more static documentation layout.
159:     *   It displays the same information derived from your code and the OpenAPI schema (paths, parameters, schemas, descriptions) but in a different presentation format.
160: 
161: 3.  **`http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json`**
162: 
163:     You'll see the raw **OpenAPI schema** in JSON format. This is the machine-readable definition that powers both `/docs` and `/redoc`. Tools can use this URL to automatically generate client code, run tests, and more.
164: 
165: **Enhancing the Docs:**
166: 
167: Notice how FastAPI used:
168: 
169: *   `title`, `description`, `version` in `app = FastAPI(...)` for the overall API info.
170: *   `tags=["Items"]` to group related operations.
171: *   Docstrings (`"""Create a new item..."""`) for operation descriptions.
172: *   Pydantic models (`Item`) for request body and response schemas.
173: *   Type hints and `Path`/`Query` for parameter definitions, including their `title` and `description`.
174: 
175: You can make your documentation even richer by adding more details like examples, summaries, and descriptions to your Pydantic models and parameters.
176: 
177: ```python
178: # Example: Adding more detail to the Pydantic model
179: from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
180: # ... other imports ...
181: 
182: class Item(BaseModel):
183:     name: str = Field(..., # ... means required
184:                       title="Item Name",
185:                       description="The name of the item.",
186:                       example="Super Gadget")
187:     description: str | None = Field(default=None,
188:                                    title="Item Description",
189:                                    max_length=300,
190:                                    example="A very useful gadget.")
191:     price: float = Field(...,
192:                        gt=0, # Price must be greater than 0
193:                        title="Price",
194:                        description="The price of the item in USD.",
195:                        example=19.99)
196:     tax: float | None = Field(default=None,
197:                              ge=0, # Tax >= 0 if provided
198:                              title="Tax",
199:                              description="Optional sales tax.",
200:                              example=1.60)
201: 
202: # ... rest of your FastAPI app ...
203: ```
204: 
205: With these `Field` annotations, your documentation (especially in the "Schemas" section at the bottom of `/docs`) will become even more descriptive and helpful.
206: 
207: ## How it Works Under the Hood (Simplified)
208: 
209: How does FastAPI pull off this magic?
210: 
211: 1.  **App Initialization:** When your `FastAPI()` application starts up, it doesn't just prepare to handle requests; it also sets up the documentation system.
212: 2.  **Route Inspection:** FastAPI iterates through all the path operations you've defined (like `@app.post("/items/")`, `@app.get("/items/{item_id}")`). It uses Python's `inspect` module and its own logic to analyze each route.
213: 3.  **Metadata Extraction:** For each route, it gathers all relevant information:
214:     *   The URL path (`/items/`, `/items/{item_id}`)
215:     *   The HTTP method (`POST`, `GET`)
216:     *   Function parameters (name, type hint, default value, `Path`/`Query`/`Body` info)
217:     *   Pydantic models used for request bodies and `response_model`.
218:     *   Status codes.
219:     *   Docstrings, tags, summary, description, operation ID, deprecation status.
220: 4.  **OpenAPI Model Building:** FastAPI uses this extracted information to populate a set of Pydantic models that represent the structure of an OpenAPI document (these models live in `fastapi.openapi.models`, like `OpenAPI`, `Info`, `PathItem`, `Operation`, `Schema`, etc.). The core function doing this heavy lifting is `fastapi.openapi.utils.get_openapi`.
221: 5.  **Schema Generation:** Pydantic models used in request/response bodies or parameters are converted into JSON Schema definitions, which are embedded within the OpenAPI structure under `components.schemas`. This describes the expected data shapes.
222: 6.  **Docs Endpoint Creation:** FastAPI automatically adds three special routes to your application:
223:     *   `/openapi.json`: This endpoint is configured to call `get_openapi` when requested, generate the complete OpenAPI schema as a Python dictionary, and return it as a JSON response.
224:     *   `/docs`: This endpoint uses the `fastapi.openapi.docs.get_swagger_ui_html` function. This function generates an HTML page that includes the necessary JavaScript and CSS for Swagger UI (usually loaded from a CDN). Crucially, this HTML tells the Swagger UI JavaScript to fetch the API definition from `/openapi.json`.
225:     *   `/redoc`: Similarly, this endpoint uses `fastapi.openapi.docs.get_redoc_html` to generate an HTML page that loads ReDoc and tells it to fetch the API definition from `/openapi.json`.
226: 7.  **Serving Docs:** When you visit `/docs` or `/redoc` in your browser:
227:     *   The browser first receives the basic HTML page from FastAPI.
228:     *   The JavaScript (Swagger UI or ReDoc) within that page then makes a *separate* request back to your FastAPI application, asking for `/openapi.json`.
229:     *   FastAPI responds with the generated OpenAPI JSON schema.
230:     *   The JavaScript in your browser parses this schema and dynamically renders the interactive documentation interface you see.
231: 
232: Here's a simplified view of the process when you access `/docs`:

234: ```mermaid

263: 
264: ```
265: 
266: This integration means your documentation isn't just an afterthought; it's a first-class citizen derived directly from the code that runs your API.
267: 
268: ## Conclusion
269: 
270: You've now seen how FastAPI leverages the OpenAPI standard and your own Python code (type hints, Pydantic models, docstrings) to provide automatic, interactive API documentation.
271: 
272: *   You learned about the **OpenAPI specification** as a standard way to describe APIs.
273: *   You saw that FastAPI **automatically generates** this specification by inspecting your path operations, parameters, and models.
274: *   You explored the **interactive documentation UIs** provided by Swagger UI (`/docs`) and ReDoc (`/redoc`), which make understanding and testing your API much easier.
275: *   You understood that because the docs are generated from code, they **stay up-to-date** automatically.
276: 
277: This feature significantly improves the developer experience for both the creators and consumers of your API.
278: 
279: In the next chapter, we'll explore a powerful FastAPI feature called Dependency Injection. It helps manage complex dependencies (like database connections or authentication logic) that your path operations might need, and it also integrates neatly with the OpenAPI documentation system.
280:

  8: # Chapter 5: Dependency Injection
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 4: OpenAPI & Automatic Docs](04_openapi___automatic_docs.md), we saw how FastAPI automatically generates interactive documentation for our API, making it easy for others (and ourselves!) to understand and use. This works because FastAPI understands the structure of our paths, parameters, and Pydantic models.
 11: 
 12: Now, let's explore another powerful feature that helps us write cleaner, more reusable, and better-organized code: **Dependency Injection**.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does This Solve?
 15: 
 16: Imagine you're building several API endpoints, and many of them need the same piece of information or the same setup step performed before they can do their main job. For example:
 17: 
 18: *   **Database Connection:** Many endpoints might need to talk to a database. You need to get a database "session" or connection first.
 19: *   **User Authentication:** Many endpoints might require the user to be logged in. You need to check their credentials (like a token in a header) and fetch their user details.
 20: *   **Common Parameters:** Maybe several endpoints share common query parameters like `skip` and `limit` for pagination.
 21: 
 22: You *could* write the code to get the database session, check the user, or parse the pagination parameters inside *each* path operation function. But that would be very repetitive (violating the DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself - principle) and hard to maintain. If you need to change how you get a database session, you'd have to update it in many places!
 23: 
 24: FastAPI's **Dependency Injection (DI)** system provides an elegant solution to this. It allows you to define these common pieces of logic (like getting a user or a DB session) as separate, reusable functions called "dependencies". Then, you simply "declare" that your path operation function needs the result of that dependency, and FastAPI automatically takes care of running the dependency and providing ("injecting") the result into your function.
 25: 
 26: **Our Goal Today:** Learn how to use FastAPI's `Depends` function to manage dependencies, reuse code, and make our API logic cleaner and more modular.
 27: 
 28: **Analogy:** Think of your path operation function as the main chef preparing a dish (handling the request). Before the chef can cook, they might need specific ingredients prepared or tools set up. Dependency Injection is like having specialized assistants (dependencies):
 29: *   One assistant fetches fresh vegetables (e.g., gets common query parameters).
 30: *   Another assistant prepares the cooking station (e.g., gets a database session).
 31: *   Another assistant checks the order ticket to see who the dish is for (e.g., authenticates the user).
 32: 
 33: The chef simply tells the head waiter (`Depends`) what they need ("I need prepared vegetables", "I need the cooking station ready"), and the assistants automatically provide them just in time. The chef doesn't need to know the details of *how* the vegetables were fetched or the station prepared; they just get the result.
 34: 
 35: ## Key Concepts
 36: 
 37: 1.    **Dependency:** A function (or other callable) that provides some value needed by your path operation function (or even by another dependency). Examples: a function to get the current user, a function to connect to the database, a function to parse common query parameters.
 38: 2.    **`Depends`:** A special function imported from `fastapi` (`from fastapi import Depends`) that you use in the parameters of your path operation function to signal that it requires a dependency. You use it like this: `parameter_name: Annotated[ReturnType, Depends(dependency_function)]`.
 39: 3.    **Injection:** FastAPI "injects" the *result* returned by the dependency function into the parameter of your path operation function. If `dependency_function()` returns the value `10`, then `parameter_name` will be `10` inside your path function.
 40: 4.  **Automatic Execution:** FastAPI automatically figures out which dependencies are needed for a given request, calls them in the correct order (if dependencies depend on others), and manages their results.
 41: 5.  **Reusability:** Define a dependency once, and use `Depends(your_dependency)` in multiple path operations.
 42: 6.  **Caching (Per Request):** By default, if a dependency is declared multiple times for the *same request* (e.g., if multiple path operation parameters need it, or if other dependencies need it), FastAPI will only run the dependency function *once* per request and reuse the result. This is efficient, especially for things like database connections or fetching user data. You can disable this cache if needed.
 43: 7.  **Hierarchy:** Dependencies can depend on other dependencies using `Depends` in their own parameters, forming a chain or tree of dependencies. FastAPI resolves this entire structure.
 44: 
 45: ## Using Dependencies: A Simple Example
 46: 
 47: Let's start with a very common scenario: having shared query parameters for pagination.
 48: 
 49: 1.  **Define the Dependency Function:** Create a regular Python function that takes the parameters you want to share.
 50: 
 51:     ```python
 52:     # common_dependencies.py (or within your router file)
 53:     from typing import Annotated
 54:     from fastapi import Query
 55: 
 56:     # This is our dependency function
 57:     # It takes the common query parameters
 58:     async def common_parameters(
 59:         q: Annotated[str | None, Query(description="Optional query string")] = None,
 60:         skip: Annotated[int, Query(description="Items to skip", ge=0)] = 0,
 61:         limit: Annotated[int, Query(description="Max items to return", le=100)] = 100,
 62:     ):
 63:         # It simply returns a dictionary containing these parameters
 64:         return {"q": q, "skip": skip, "limit": limit}
 65: 
 66:     ```
 67: 
 68:     **Explanation:**
 69:     *   This looks like a normal function that could handle path operation parameters.
 70:     *   It takes `q`, `skip`, and `limit` as arguments, using `Query` for validation and documentation just like we learned in [Chapter 2: Path Operations & Parameter Declaration](02_path_operations___parameter_declaration.md).
 71:     *   It returns a dictionary containing the values it received. This dictionary will be the "result" injected into our path functions.
 72: 
 73: 2.  **Use `Depends` in Path Operations:** Now, import `Depends` and your dependency function, and use it in your path operation parameters.
 74: 
 75:     ```python
 76:     # routers/items.py (example)
 77:     from typing import Annotated
 78:     from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
 79:     # Assume common_parameters is defined in common_dependencies.py
 80:     from ..common_dependencies import common_parameters
 81: 
 82:     router = APIRouter()
 83: 
 84:     # Fake data for demonstration
 85:     fake_items = [{"item_name": "Foo"}, {"item_name": "Bar"}, {"item_name": "Baz"}]
 86: 
 87:     @router.get("/items/")
 88:     # Here's the magic! Declare 'commons' parameter using Depends
 89:     async def read_items(
 90:         commons: Annotated[dict, Depends(common_parameters)] # Dependency Injection!
 91:     ):
 92:         # Inside this function, 'commons' will be the dictionary returned
 93:         # by common_parameters after FastAPI calls it with the query params.
 94:         print(f"Received common parameters: {commons}")
 95: 
 96:         # Use the values from the dependency
 97:         q = commons["q"]
 98:         skip = commons["skip"]
 99:         limit = commons["limit"]
100: 
101:         response_items = fake_items[skip : skip + limit]
102:         if q:
103:             response_items = [item for item in response_items if q in item["item_name"]]
104:         return response_items
105: 
106:     @router.get("/users/")
107:     # We can reuse the SAME dependency here!
108:     async def read_users(
109:         commons: Annotated[dict, Depends(common_parameters)] # Reusing the dependency
110:     ):
111:         # 'commons' will again be the dict returned by common_parameters
112:         print(f"Received common parameters for users: {commons}")
113:         # Imagine fetching users using commons['skip'], commons['limit']...
114:         return {"message": "Users endpoint", "params": commons}
115: 
116:     ```
117: 
118:     **Explanation:**
119:     *   `from fastapi import Depends`: We import `Depends`.
120:     *   `from ..common_dependencies import common_parameters`: We import our dependency function.
121:     *   `commons: Annotated[dict, Depends(common_parameters)]`: This is the key part!
122:         *   We declare a parameter named `commons`.
123:         *   Its type hint is `dict` (because our dependency returns a dictionary). *Technically, FastAPI infers the type from the dependency function's return type hint if available, but explicitly adding `dict` here helps clarity.* For more complex types, use the exact return type.
124:         *   We wrap the type hint and `Depends(common_parameters)` in `Annotated`. This is the standard way to use `Depends`.
125:         *   `Depends(common_parameters)` tells FastAPI: "Before running `read_items`, call the `common_parameters` function. Take the query parameters `q`, `skip`, `limit` from the incoming request, pass them to `common_parameters`, get its return value, and assign it to the `commons` variable."
126:     *   **Reusability:** Notice how `read_users` uses the *exact same* dependency declaration `Annotated[dict, Depends(common_parameters)]`. We didn't have to repeat the `q`, `skip`, `limit` definitions.
127: 
128: **How it Behaves:**
129: 
130: 1.  Run your app (`uvicorn main:app --reload`, assuming `main.py` includes this router).
131: 2.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/?skip=1&limit=1`.
132:     *   FastAPI sees `Depends(common_parameters)`.
133:     *   It extracts `skip=1` and `limit=1` (and `q=None`) from the query string.
134:     *   It calls `common_parameters(q=None, skip=1, limit=1)`.
135:     *   `common_parameters` returns `{"q": None, "skip": 1, "limit": 1}`.
136:     *   FastAPI calls `read_items(commons={"q": None, "skip": 1, "limit": 1})`.
137:     *   You see the print statement and get the response `[{"item_name":"Bar"}]`.
138: 3.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/?q=test`.
139:     *   FastAPI calls `common_parameters(q="test", skip=0, limit=100)`.
140:     *   `common_parameters` returns `{"q": "test", "skip": 0, "limit": 100}`.
141:     *   FastAPI calls `read_users(commons={"q": "test", "skip": 0, "limit": 100})`.
142:     *   You see the print statement and get the JSON response.
143: 
144: ## Dependencies Can Depend on Other Dependencies
145: 
146: The real power comes when dependencies themselves need other dependencies. Let's sketch a simplified example for getting an item from a fake database.
147: 
148: 1.  **Define a "DB Session" Dependency:** (This will be fake, just returning a string).
149: 
150:     ```python
151:     # common_dependencies.py
152:     async def get_db_session():
153:         print("Getting DB Session")
154:         # In reality, this would connect to a DB and yield/return a session object
155:         session = "fake_db_session_123"
156:         # You might use 'yield' here for setup/teardown (see FastAPI docs)
157:         return session
158:     ```
159: 
160: 2.  **Define a Dependency that Uses the DB Session:**
161: 
162:     ```python
163:     # common_dependencies.py
164:     from typing import Annotated
165:     from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException
166: 
167:     # Import the DB session dependency
168:     from .common_dependencies import get_db_session
169: 
170:     async def get_item_from_db(
171:         item_id: int, # Takes a regular path parameter
172:         db: Annotated[str, Depends(get_db_session)] # Depends on get_db_session!
173:     ):
174:         print(f"Getting item {item_id} using DB session: {db}")
175:         # Fake database interaction
176:         fake_db = {1: "Item One", 2: "Item Two"}
177:         if item_id not in fake_db:
178:             raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found in DB")
179:         return fake_db[item_id]
180:     ```
181: 
182:     **Explanation:**
183:     *   `get_item_from_db` takes a regular `item_id` (which FastAPI will get from the path).
184:     *   It *also* takes `db: Annotated[str, Depends(get_db_session)]`. It declares its *own* dependency on `get_db_session`.
185:     *   When FastAPI needs to run `get_item_from_db`, it first sees the `Depends(get_db_session)`. It runs `get_db_session`, gets `"fake_db_session_123"`, and then calls `get_item_from_db(item_id=..., db="fake_db_session_123")`.
186: 
187: 3.  **Use the High-Level Dependency in a Path Operation:**
188: 
189:     ```python
190:     # routers/items.py
191:     # ... other imports ...
192:     from ..common_dependencies import get_item_from_db
193: 
194:     @router.get("/db_items/{item_id}")
195:     # This endpoint depends on get_item_from_db
196:     async def read_db_item(
197:         item_id: int, # Path parameter for get_item_from_db
198:         item_name: Annotated[str, Depends(get_item_from_db)] # Inject result here!
199:     ):
200:         # 'item_name' will be the string returned by get_item_from_db
201:         # after it used the result from get_db_session.
202:         return {"item_id": item_id, "name_from_db": item_name}
203:     ```
204: 
205:     **Explanation:**
206:     *   The `read_db_item` function only needs to declare `Depends(get_item_from_db)`.
207:     *   FastAPI automatically handles the whole chain: `read_db_item` -> `get_item_from_db` -> `get_db_session`.
208:     *   Notice the `item_id: int` path parameter is declared in *both* `read_db_item` and `get_item_from_db`. FastAPI is smart enough to pass the path parameter value to the dependency that needs it.
209: 
210: **Caching in Action:**
211: 
212: If `get_db_session` was also needed directly by `read_db_item` (e.g., `db_session: Annotated[str, Depends(get_db_session)]`), FastAPI would *still* only call `get_db_session` **once** for the entire request to `/db_items/{item_id}` because of the default caching (`use_cache=True` in `Depends`). The result `"fake_db_session_123"` would be shared.
213: 
214: ## How it Works Under the Hood (Simplified)
215: 
216: Let's trace a request to `/db_items/2` using the example above:
217: 
218: 1.  **Request:** Client sends `GET /db_items/2`.
219: 2.  **Routing:** FastAPI matches the request to the `read_db_item` path operation function.
220: 3.  **Dependency Analysis:** FastAPI inspects the signature of `read_db_item`:
221:     *   `item_id: int` -> Needs value from path. Value is `2`.
222:     *   `item_name: Annotated[str, Depends(get_item_from_db)]` -> Needs the result of `get_item_from_db`.
223: 4.  **Solving `get_item_from_db`:** FastAPI inspects `get_item_from_db`:
224:     *   `item_id: int` -> Needs a value. FastAPI sees `item_id` is also needed by the parent (`read_db_item`) and comes from the path. Value is `2`.
225:     *   `db: Annotated[str, Depends(get_db_session)]` -> Needs the result of `get_db_session`.
226: 5.  **Solving `get_db_session`:** FastAPI inspects `get_db_session`:
227:     *   It has no parameters.
228:     *   Checks cache: Has `get_db_session` run for this request? No.
229:     *   Calls `get_db_session()`. It prints "Getting DB Session" and returns `"fake_db_session_123"`.
230:     *   Stores `get_db_session` -> `"fake_db_session_123"` in the request cache.
231: 6.  **Calling `get_item_from_db`:** FastAPI now has the dependencies for `get_item_from_db`:
232:     *   `item_id` = `2` (from path)
233:     *   `db` = `"fake_db_session_123"` (from `get_db_session` result)
234:     *   Calls `get_item_from_db(item_id=2, db="fake_db_session_123")`.
235:     *   It prints "Getting item 2 using DB session: fake_db_session_123", looks up `2` in its fake DB, and returns `"Item Two"`.
236:     *   Stores `get_item_from_db` -> `"Item Two"` in the request cache.
237: 7.  **Calling `read_db_item`:** FastAPI now has the dependencies for `read_db_item`:
238:     *   `item_id` = `2` (from path)
239:     *   `item_name` = `"Item Two"` (from `get_item_from_db` result)
240:     *   Calls `read_db_item(item_id=2, item_name="Item Two")`.
241: 8.  **Response:** The function returns `{"item_id": 2, "name_from_db": "Item Two"}`, which FastAPI sends back to the client as JSON.

275: ### Code Connections
276: 
277: *   **`fastapi.Depends`** (`fastapi/param_functions.py`): This class is mostly a marker. When FastAPI analyzes function parameters, it looks for instances of `Depends`.
278: *   **`fastapi.dependencies.utils.get_dependant`**: This crucial function takes a callable (like your path operation function or another dependency) and inspects its signature. It identifies which parameters are path/query/body parameters and which are dependencies (marked with `Depends`). It builds a `Dependant` object representing this.
279: *   **`fastapi.dependencies.models.Dependant`**: A data structure (dataclass) that holds information about a callable: its name, the callable itself, its path/query/header/cookie/body parameters, and importantly, a list of *other* `Dependant` objects for its sub-dependencies. This creates the dependency tree/graph.
280: *   **`fastapi.dependencies.utils.solve_dependencies`**: This is the engine that recursively traverses the `Dependant` graph for a given request. It figures out the order, checks the cache (`dependency_cache`), calls the dependency functions (using `run_in_threadpool` for sync functions or awaiting async ones), handles results from generators (`yield`), and gathers all the computed values needed to finally call the target path operation function.
281: 
282: FastAPI intelligently combines Python's introspection capabilities with this structured dependency resolution system.
283: 
284: ## Conclusion
285: 
286: You've learned about FastAPI's powerful Dependency Injection system!
287: 
288: *   You saw how to define reusable logic in **dependency functions**.
289: *   You learned to use **`Depends`** in your path operation function parameters to tell FastAPI what dependencies are needed.
290: *   You understood that FastAPI automatically **calls** dependencies and **injects** their results into your function.
291: *   You saw how dependencies can **depend on other dependencies**, creating manageable hierarchies.
292: *   You learned that results are **cached per request** by default for efficiency.
293: *   You grasped the core idea: separating concerns and promoting **reusable code**.
294: 
295: Dependency Injection is fundamental to building complex, maintainable applications in FastAPI. It's used extensively for things like database connections, authentication, authorization, and processing complex parameter sets.
296: 
297: While dependencies help manage complexity, sometimes things inevitably go wrong – a database might be unavailable, validation might fail within a dependency, or unexpected errors might occur. How should our API handle these situations gracefully? That's what we'll cover next.
298:

  8: # Chapter 6: Error Handling
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 5: Dependency Injection](05_dependency_injection.md), we learned how to structure our code using dependencies to manage common tasks like pagination or database sessions. This helps keep our code clean and reusable.
 11: 
 12: But what happens when things don't go as planned? A user might request data that doesn't exist, or they might send invalid input. Our API needs a way to gracefully handle these situations and inform the client about what went wrong.
 13: 
 14: **Our Goal Today:** Learn how FastAPI helps us manage errors effectively, both for problems we expect (like "item not found") and for unexpected issues like invalid input data.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Does This Solve?
 17: 
 18: Imagine our online store API. We have an endpoint like `/items/{item_id}` to fetch details about a specific item. What should happen if a user tries to access `/items/9999` but there's no item with ID 9999 in our database?
 19: 
 20: If we don't handle this, our application might crash or return a confusing, generic server error (like `500 Internal Server Error`). This isn't helpful for the person using our API. They need clear feedback: "The item you asked for doesn't exist."
 21: 
 22: Similarly, if a user tries to *create* an item (`POST /items/`) but forgets to include the required `price` field in the JSON body, we shouldn't just crash. We need to tell them, "You forgot the price field!"
 23: 
 24: FastAPI provides a structured way to handle these different types of errors, ensuring clear communication with the client. Think of it as setting up clear emergency procedures for your API.
 25: 
 26: ## Key Concepts
 27: 
 28: 1.  **`HTTPException` for Expected Errors:**
 29:     *   These are errors you anticipate might occur based on the client's request, like requesting a non-existent resource or lacking permissions.
 30:     *   You can **raise** `HTTPException` directly in your code.
 31:     *   You specify an appropriate HTTP **status code** (like `404 Not Found`, `403 Forbidden`) and a helpful **detail message** (like `"Item not found"`).
 32:     *   FastAPI catches this exception and automatically sends a properly formatted JSON error response to the client.
 33: 
 34: 2.  **`RequestValidationError` for Invalid Input:**
 35:     *   This error occurs when the data sent by the client in the request (path parameters, query parameters, or request body) fails the validation rules defined by your type hints and Pydantic models (as seen in [Chapter 2: Path Operations & Parameter Declaration](02_path_operations___parameter_declaration.md) and [Chapter 3: Data Validation & Serialization (Pydantic)](03_data_validation___serialization__pydantic_.md)).
 36:     *   FastAPI **automatically** catches these validation errors.
 37:     *   It sends back a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response containing detailed information about *which* fields were invalid and *why*. You usually don't need to write extra code for this!
 38: 
 39: 3.  **Custom Exception Handlers:**
 40:     *   For more advanced scenarios, you can define your *own* functions to handle specific types of exceptions (either built-in Python exceptions or custom ones you create).
 41:     *   This gives you full control over how errors are logged and what response is sent back to the client.
 42: 
 43: ## Using `HTTPException` for Expected Errors
 44: 
 45: Let's solve our "item not found" problem using `HTTPException`.
 46: 
 47: 1.  **Import `HTTPException`:**
 48: 
 49:     ```python
 50:     # main.py or your router file
 51:     from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
 52: 
 53:     app = FastAPI() # Or use your APIRouter
 54: 
 55:     # Simple in-memory storage (like from Chapter 4)
 56:     fake_items_db = {1: {"name": "Foo"}, 2: {"name": "Bar"}}
 57:     ```
 58: 
 59:     **Explanation:** We import `HTTPException` directly from `fastapi`.
 60: 
 61: 2.  **Check and Raise in Your Path Operation:**
 62: 
 63:     ```python
 64:     @app.get("/items/{item_id}")
 65:     async def read_item(item_id: int):
 66:         # Check if the requested item_id exists in our "database"
 67:         if item_id not in fake_items_db:
 68:             # If not found, raise HTTPException!
 69:             raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
 70: 
 71:         # If found, proceed normally
 72:         return {"item": fake_items_db[item_id]}
 73:     ```
 74: 
 75:     **Explanation:**
 76:     *   Inside `read_item`, we check if the `item_id` exists as a key in our `fake_items_db` dictionary.
 77:     *   If `item_id` is *not* found, we `raise HTTPException(...)`.
 78:         *   `status_code=404`: We use the standard HTTP status code `404 Not Found`. FastAPI knows many common status codes (you can also use `from starlette import status; raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND, ...)` for more readability).
 79:         *   `detail="Item not found"`: We provide a human-readable message explaining the error. This will be sent back to the client in the JSON response body.
 80:     *   If the item *is* found, the `raise` statement is skipped, and the function returns the item details as usual.
 81: 
 82: **How it Behaves:**
 83: 
 84: *   **Request:** Client sends `GET /items/1`
 85:     *   **Response (Status Code 200):**
 86:         ```json
 87:         {"item": {"name": "Foo"}}
 88:         ```
 89: *   **Request:** Client sends `GET /items/99`
 90:     *   **Response (Status Code 404):**
 91:         ```json
 92:         {"detail": "Item not found"}
 93:         ```
 94: 
 95: FastAPI automatically catches the `HTTPException` you raised and sends the correct HTTP status code along with the `detail` message formatted as JSON.
 96: 
 97: ## Automatic Handling of `RequestValidationError`
 98: 
 99: You've already seen this in action without realizing it! When you define Pydantic models for your request bodies or use type hints for path/query parameters, FastAPI automatically validates incoming data.
100: 
101: Let's revisit the `create_item` example from [Chapter 3: Data Validation & Serialization (Pydantic)](03_data_validation___serialization__pydantic_.md):
102: 
103: ```python
104: # main.py or your router file
105: from fastapi import FastAPI
106: from pydantic import BaseModel
107: 
108: app = FastAPI()
109: 
110: # Pydantic model requiring name and price
111: class Item(BaseModel):
112:     name: str
113:     price: float
114:     description: str | None = None
115: 
116: @app.post("/items/")
117: # Expects request body matching the Item model
118: async def create_item(item: Item):
119:     # If execution reaches here, validation PASSED automatically.
120:     return {"message": "Item received!", "item_data": item.model_dump()}
121: ```
122: 
123: **How it Behaves (Automatically):**
124: 
125: *   **Request:** Client sends `POST /items/` with a *valid* JSON body:
126:     ```json
127:     {
128:       "name": "Gadget",
129:       "price": 19.95
130:     }
131:     ```
132:     *   **Response (Status Code 200):**
133:         ```json
134:         {
135:           "message": "Item received!",
136:           "item_data": {
137:             "name": "Gadget",
138:             "price": 19.95,
139:             "description": null
140:           }
141:         }
142:         ```
143: 
144: *   **Request:** Client sends `POST /items/` with an *invalid* JSON body (missing `price`):
145:     ```json
146:     {
147:       "name": "Widget"
148:     }
149:     ```
150:     *   **Response (Status Code 422):** FastAPI *automatically* intercepts this before `create_item` runs and sends:
151:         ```json
152:         {
153:           "detail": [
154:             {
155:               "type": "missing",
156:               "loc": [
157:                 "body",
158:                 "price"
159:               ],
160:               "msg": "Field required",
161:               "input": {
162:                 "name": "Widget"
163:               },
164:               "url": "..." // Link to Pydantic error docs
165:             }
166:           ]
167:         }
168:         ```
169: 
170: *   **Request:** Client sends `POST /items/` with an *invalid* JSON body (wrong type for `price`):
171:     ```json
172:     {
173:       "name": "Doohickey",
174:       "price": "cheap"
175:     }
176:     ```
177:     *   **Response (Status Code 422):** FastAPI automatically sends:
178:         ```json
179:         {
180:           "detail": [
181:             {
182:               "type": "float_parsing",
183:               "loc": [
184:                 "body",
185:                 "price"
186:               ],
187:               "msg": "Input should be a valid number, unable to parse string as a number",
188:               "input": "cheap",
189:               "url": "..."
190:             }
191:           ]
192:         }
193:         ```
194: 
195: Notice that we didn't write any `try...except` blocks or `if` statements in `create_item` to handle these validation issues. FastAPI and Pydantic take care of it, providing detailed error messages that tell the client exactly what went wrong and where (`loc`). This is a huge time saver!
196: 
197: ## Custom Exception Handlers (A Quick Look)
198: 
199: Sometimes, you might want to handle specific errors in a unique way. Maybe you want to log a particular error to a monitoring service, or perhaps you need to return error responses in a completely custom format different from FastAPI's default.
200: 
201: FastAPI allows you to register **exception handlers** using the `@app.exception_handler()` decorator.
202: 
203: **Example:** Imagine you have a custom error `UnicornNotFound` and want to return a `418 I'm a teapot` status code when it occurs.
204: 
205: 1.  **Define the Custom Exception:**
206: 
207:     ```python
208:     # Can be in your main file or a separate exceptions.py
209:     class UnicornNotFound(Exception):
210:         def __init__(self, name: str):
211:             self.name = name
212:     ```
213: 
214: 2.  **Define the Handler Function:**
215: 
216:     ```python
217:     # main.py
218:     from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
219:     from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
220:     # Assuming UnicornNotFound is defined above or imported
221: 
222:     app = FastAPI()
223: 
224:     # Decorator registers this function to handle UnicornNotFound errors
225:     @app.exception_handler(UnicornNotFound)
226:     async def unicorn_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: UnicornNotFound):
227:         # This function runs whenever UnicornNotFound is raised
228:         return JSONResponse(
229:             status_code=418, # I'm a teapot!
230:             content={"message": f"Oops! Can't find unicorn named: {exc.name}."},
231:         )
232:     ```
233: 
234:     **Explanation:**
235:     *   `@app.exception_handler(UnicornNotFound)`: This tells FastAPI that the `unicorn_exception_handler` function should be called whenever an error of type `UnicornNotFound` is raised *and not caught* elsewhere.
236:     *   The handler function receives the `request` object and the exception instance (`exc`).
237:     *   It returns a `JSONResponse` with the desired status code (418) and a custom content dictionary.
238: 
239: 3.  **Raise the Custom Exception in a Path Operation:**
240: 
241:     ```python
242:     @app.get("/unicorns/{name}")
243:     async def read_unicorn(name: str):
244:         if name == "yolo":
245:             # Raise our custom exception
246:             raise UnicornNotFound(name=name)
247:         return {"unicorn_name": name, "message": "Unicorn exists!"}
248:     ```
249: 
250: **How it Behaves:**
251: 
252: *   **Request:** `GET /unicorns/sparklehoof`
253:     *   **Response (Status Code 200):**
254:         ```json
255:         {"unicorn_name": "sparklehoof", "message": "Unicorn exists!"}
256:         ```
257: *   **Request:** `GET /unicorns/yolo`
258:     *   **Response (Status Code 418):** (Handled by `unicorn_exception_handler`)
259:         ```json
260:         {"message": "Oops! Can't find unicorn named: yolo."}
261:         ```
262: 
263: Custom handlers provide flexibility, but for most common API errors, `HTTPException` and the automatic `RequestValidationError` handling are sufficient.
264: 
265: ## How it Works Under the Hood (Simplified)
266: 
267: When an error occurs during a request, FastAPI follows a process to decide how to respond:
268: 
269: **Scenario 1: Raising `HTTPException`**
270: 
271: 1.  **Raise:** Your path operation code (e.g., `read_item`) executes `raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")`.
272: 2.  **Catch:** FastAPI's internal request/response cycle catches this specific `HTTPException`.
273: 3.  **Find Handler:** FastAPI checks if there's a custom handler registered for `HTTPException`. If not (which is usually the case unless you override it), it uses its **default handler** for `HTTPException`.
274: 4.  **Default Handler Executes:** The default handler (`fastapi.exception_handlers.http_exception_handler`) takes the `status_code` and `detail` from the exception you raised.
275: 5.  **Create Response:** It creates a `starlette.responses.JSONResponse` containing `{"detail": exc.detail}` and sets the status code to `exc.status_code`.
276: 6.  **Send Response:** This JSON response is sent back to the client.
277: 
278: ```mermaid
279: sequenceDiagram
280:     participant Client
281:     participant FastAPIApp as FastAPI App
282:     participant RouteHandler as Route Handler (read_item)
283:     participant DefaultHTTPExceptionHandler as Default HTTPException Handler
284: 
285:     Client->>+FastAPIApp: GET /items/99
286:     FastAPIApp->>+RouteHandler: Call read_item(item_id=99)
287:     RouteHandler->>RouteHandler: Check DB: item 99 not found
288:     RouteHandler-->>-FastAPIApp: raise HTTPException(404, "Item not found")
289:     Note over FastAPIApp: Catches HTTPException
290:     FastAPIApp->>+DefaultHTTPExceptionHandler: Handle the exception instance
291:     DefaultHTTPExceptionHandler->>DefaultHTTPExceptionHandler: Extract status_code=404, detail="Item not found"
292:     DefaultHTTPExceptionHandler-->>-FastAPIApp: Return JSONResponse(status=404, content={"detail": "..."})
293:     FastAPIApp-->>-Client: Send 404 JSON Response
294: ```
295: 
296: **Scenario 2: Automatic `RequestValidationError`**
297: 
298: 1.  **Request:** Client sends `POST /items/` with invalid data (e.g., missing `price`).
299: 2.  **Parameter/Body Parsing:** FastAPI tries to parse the request body and validate it against the `Item` Pydantic model before calling `create_item`.
300: 3.  **Pydantic Raises:** Pydantic's validation fails and raises a `pydantic.ValidationError`.
301: 4.  **FastAPI Wraps:** FastAPI catches the `pydantic.ValidationError` and wraps it inside its own `fastapi.exceptions.RequestValidationError` to add context.
302: 5.  **Catch:** FastAPI's internal request/response cycle catches the `RequestValidationError`.
303: 6.  **Find Handler:** FastAPI looks for a handler for `RequestValidationError` and finds its default one.
304: 7.  **Default Handler Executes:** The default handler (`fastapi.exception_handlers.request_validation_exception_handler`) takes the `RequestValidationError`.
305: 8.  **Extract & Format Errors:** It calls the `.errors()` method on the exception to get the list of validation errors provided by Pydantic. It then formats this list into the standard structure (with `loc`, `msg`, `type`).
306: 9.  **Create Response:** It creates a `JSONResponse` with status code `422` and the formatted error details as the content.
307: 10. **Send Response:** This 422 JSON response is sent back to the client. Your `create_item` function was never even called.
308: 
309: ### Code Connections
310: 
311: *   **`fastapi.exceptions.HTTPException`**: The class you import and raise for expected client errors. Defined in `fastapi/exceptions.py`. It inherits from `starlette.exceptions.HTTPException`.
312: *   **`fastapi.exception_handlers.http_exception_handler`**: The default function that handles `HTTPException`. Defined in `fastapi/exception_handlers.py`. It creates a `JSONResponse`.
313: *   **`fastapi.exceptions.RequestValidationError`**: The exception FastAPI raises internally when Pydantic validation fails for request data. Defined in `fastapi/exceptions.py`.
314: *   **`fastapi.exception_handlers.request_validation_exception_handler`**: The default function that handles `RequestValidationError`. Defined in `fastapi/exception_handlers.py`. It calls `jsonable_encoder(exc.errors())` and creates a 422 `JSONResponse`.
315: *   **`@app.exception_handler(ExceptionType)`**: The decorator used on the `FastAPI` app instance to register your own custom handler functions. The `exception_handler` method is part of the `FastAPI` class in `fastapi/applications.py`.
316: 
317: ## Conclusion
318: 
319: You've learned how FastAPI helps you manage errors gracefully!
320: 
321: *   You can handle **expected client errors** (like "not found") by raising **`HTTPException`** with a specific `status_code` and `detail` message.
322: *   FastAPI **automatically handles validation errors** (`RequestValidationError`) when incoming data doesn't match your Pydantic models or type hints, returning detailed `422` responses.
323: *   You can define **custom exception handlers** for fine-grained control over error responses and logging using `@app.exception_handler()`.
324: 
325: Using these tools makes your API more robust, predictable, and easier for clients to interact with, even when things go wrong. Clear error messages are a crucial part of a good API design.
326: 
327: Now that we know how to handle errors, let's think about another critical aspect: security. How do we protect our endpoints, ensuring only authorized users can access certain data or perform specific actions?

  8: # Chapter 7: Security Utilities
  9: 
 10: Hi there! 👋 In [Chapter 6: Error Handling](06_error_handling.md), we learned how to handle situations where things go wrong in our API, like when a user requests an item that doesn't exist. Now, let's talk about protecting our API endpoints.
 11: 
 12: Imagine our online store API. Anyone should be able to browse items (`GET /items/`). But maybe only registered, logged-in users should be allowed to *create* new items (`POST /items/`) or view their own profile (`GET /users/me`). How do we ensure only the right people can access certain parts of our API?
 13: 
 14: That's where **Security Utilities** come in!
 15: 
 16: **Our Goal Today:** Learn how FastAPI provides ready-made tools to implement common security mechanisms like username/password checks or API keys, making it easy to protect your endpoints.
 17: 
 18: ## What Problem Does This Solve?
 19: 
 20: When you build an API, some parts might be public, but others need protection. You need a way to:
 21: 
 22: 1.  **Identify the User:** Figure out *who* is making the request. Are they logged in? Do they have a valid API key? This process is called **Authentication** (AuthN - proving who you are).
 23: 2.  **Check Permissions (Optional but related):** Once you know who the user is, you might need to check if they have permission to do what they're asking. Can user "Alice" delete user "Bob"? This is called **Authorization** (AuthZ - checking what you're allowed to do). (We'll focus mainly on Authentication in this beginner chapter).
 24: 3.  **Ask for Credentials:** How does the user provide their identity? Common ways include:
 25:     *   **HTTP Basic Authentication:** Sending a username and password directly (encoded) in the request headers. Simple, but less secure over plain HTTP.
 26:     *   **API Keys:** Sending a secret key (a long string) in the headers, query parameters, or cookies. Common for server-to-server communication.
 27:     *   **OAuth2 Bearer Tokens:** Sending a temporary token (obtained after logging in) in the headers. Very common for web and mobile apps.
 28: 4.  **Document Security:** How do you tell users of your API (in the `/docs`) that certain endpoints require authentication and how to provide it?
 29: 
 30: Implementing these security schemes from scratch can be complex and tricky. FastAPI gives you pre-built components (like different types of locks and keys) that handle the common patterns for asking for and receiving credentials.
 31: 
 32: ## Key Concepts
 33: 
 34: 1.  **Security Schemes:** These are the standard protocols or methods used for authentication, like HTTP Basic, API Keys (in different locations), and OAuth2. FastAPI provides classes that represent these schemes (e.g., `HTTPBasic`, `APIKeyHeader`, `OAuth2PasswordBearer`). Think of these as the *type* of lock mechanism you want to install on your door.
 35: 
 36: 2.  **`fastapi.security` Module:** This module contains all the pre-built security scheme classes. You'll import things like `HTTPBasic`, `APIKeyHeader`, `APIKeyQuery`, `APIKeyCookie`, `OAuth2PasswordBearer` from here.
 37: 
 38: 3.  **Credentials:** The actual "secret" information the user provides to prove their identity (username/password, the API key string, the OAuth2 token string).
 39: 
 40: 4.  **Verifier Dependency:** A function you write (a dependency, like we learned about in [Chapter 5: Dependency Injection](05_dependency_injection.md)) that takes the credentials extracted by the security scheme and checks if they are valid. It might check a username/password against a database or validate an API key. This function decides if the "key" fits the "lock".
 41: 
 42: 5.  **`Security()` Function:** This is a special function imported from `fastapi` (`from fastapi import Security`). It works almost exactly like `Depends()`, but it's specifically designed for security dependencies. You use it like this: `user: Annotated[UserType, Security(your_verifier_dependency)]`.
 43:     *   **Main Difference from `Depends()`:** Using `Security()` tells FastAPI to automatically add the corresponding security requirements to your OpenAPI documentation (`/docs`). This means `/docs` will show a little lock icon on protected endpoints and provide UI elements for users to enter their credentials (like username/password or a token) when trying out the API.
 44: 
 45: **Analogy:**
 46: *   **Security Scheme (`HTTPBasic`, `APIKeyHeader`):** The type of lock on the door (e.g., a key lock, a combination lock).
 47: *   **Scheme Instance (`security = HTTPBasic()`):** Installing that specific lock on a particular door frame.
 48: *   **Credentials (`username/password`, `API key`):** The key or combination provided by the person trying to open the door.
 49: *   **Verifier Dependency (`get_current_user`):** The person or mechanism that takes the key/combination, checks if it's correct, and decides whether to let the person in.
 50: *   **`Security(get_current_user)`:** Declaring that the door requires the verifier to check the key/combination before allowing entry, and also putting a "Lock" sign on the door in the building map (`/docs`).
 51: 
 52: ## Using Security Utilities: HTTP Basic Auth Example
 53: 
 54: Let's protect an endpoint using the simplest method: HTTP Basic Authentication. We'll create an endpoint `/users/me` that requires a valid username and password.
 55: 
 56: **Step 1: Import necessary tools**
 57: 
 58: We need `HTTPBasic` (the scheme), `HTTPBasicCredentials` (a Pydantic model to hold the extracted username/password), `Security` (to declare the dependency), `Annotated`, and `HTTPException` (for errors).
 59: 
 60: ```python
 61: # main.py (or your router file)
 62: from typing import Annotated
 63: 
 64: from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException, status
 65: from fastapi.security import HTTPBasic, HTTPBasicCredentials
 66: ```
 67: 
 68: **Step 2: Create an instance of the security scheme**
 69: 
 70: We create an instance of `HTTPBasic`. This object knows *how* to ask the browser/client for username/password via standard HTTP mechanisms.
 71: 
 72: ```python
 73: # Right after imports
 74: security = HTTPBasic()
 75: 
 76: app = FastAPI() # Or use your APIRouter
 77: ```
 78: 
 79: **Step 3: Define the "Verifier" Dependency Function**
 80: 
 81: This function will receive the credentials extracted by `security` and check if they are valid. For this beginner example, we'll use hardcoded values. In a real app, you'd check against a database.
 82: 
 83: ```python
 84: # Our "verifier" function
 85: def get_current_username(credentials: Annotated[HTTPBasicCredentials, Depends(security)]):
 86:     # NOTE: In a real app, NEVER hardcode credentials like this!
 87:     #       Always use secure password hashing (e.g., with passlib)
 88:     #       and check against a database.
 89:     correct_username = "stanley"
 90:     correct_password = "password123" # Don't do this in production!
 91: 
 92:     # Basic check (insecure comparison for demonstration)
 93:     is_correct_username = credentials.username == correct_username
 94:     is_correct_password = credentials.password == correct_password # Insecure!
 95: 
 96:     if not (is_correct_username and is_correct_password):
 97:         # If credentials are bad, raise an exception
 98:         raise HTTPException(
 99:             status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
100:             detail="Incorrect email or password",
101:             headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Basic"}, # Required header for 401 Basic Auth
102:         )
103:     # If credentials are okay, return the username
104:     return credentials.username
105: 
106: ```
107: 
108: **Explanation:**
109: 
110: *   `get_current_username` is our dependency function.
111: *   `credentials: Annotated[HTTPBasicCredentials, Depends(security)]`: It depends on our `security` object (`HTTPBasic`). FastAPI will run `security` first. `security` will extract the username and password from the `Authorization: Basic ...` header and provide them as an `HTTPBasicCredentials` object to this function.
112: *   Inside, we perform a (very insecure, for demo only!) check against hardcoded values.
113: *   If the check fails, we `raise HTTPException` with status `401 Unauthorized`. The `headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Basic"}` part is important; it tells the browser *how* it should ask for credentials (using the Basic scheme).
114: *   If the check passes, we return the validated username.
115: 
116: **Step 4: Use `Security()` in the Path Operation**
117: 
118: Now, let's create our protected endpoint `/users/me`. Instead of `Depends`, we use `Security` with our verifier function.
119: 
120: ```python
121: @app.get("/users/me")
122: async def read_current_user(
123:     # Use Security() with the verifier function
124:     username: Annotated[str, Security(get_current_username)]
125: ):
126:     # If the code reaches here, get_current_username ran successfully
127:     # and returned the validated username.
128:     # 'username' variable now holds the result from get_current_username.
129:     return {"username": username}
130: 
131: ```
132: 
133: **Explanation:**
134: 
135: *   `username: Annotated[str, Security(get_current_username)]`: We declare that this path operation requires the `get_current_username` dependency, using `Security`.
136:     *   FastAPI will first run `get_current_username`.
137:     *   `get_current_username` will, in turn, trigger `security` (`HTTPBasic`) to get the credentials.
138:     *   If `get_current_username` succeeds (doesn't raise an exception), its return value (the username string) will be injected into the `username` parameter of `read_current_user`.
139:     *   If `get_current_username` (or the underlying `HTTPBasic`) raises an `HTTPException`, the request stops, the error response is sent, and `read_current_user` is never called.
140:     *   Crucially, `Security()` also adds the HTTP Basic security requirement to the OpenAPI schema for this endpoint.
141: 
142: **How it Behaves:**
143: 
144: 1.  **Run the App:** `uvicorn main:app --reload`
145: 2.  **Visit `/docs`:** Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.
146:     *   You'll see the `/users/me` endpoint now has a **padlock icon** 🔒 next to it.
147:     *   Click the "Authorize" button (usually near the top right). A popup will appear asking for Username and Password for the "HTTPBasic" scheme.
148:     *   Enter `stanley` and `password123` and click Authorize.
149:     *   Now, try out the `/users/me` endpoint. Click "Try it out", then "Execute". It should work and return `{"username": "stanley"}`. The browser automatically added the correct `Authorization` header because you authorized in the UI.
150:     *   Click "Authorize" again and "Logout". Now try executing `/users/me` again. You'll get a `401 Unauthorized` error with `{"detail": "Not authenticated"}` (this default comes from `HTTPBasic` when no credentials are provided).
151: 3.  **Use `curl` (Command Line):**
152:     *   `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/me` -> Returns `{"detail":"Not authenticated"}` (401).
153:     *   `curl -u wronguser:wrongpass http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/me` -> Returns `{"detail":"Incorrect email or password"}` (401). The `-u` flag makes `curl` use HTTP Basic Auth.
154:     *   `curl -u stanley:password123 http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/me` -> Returns `{"username": "stanley"}` (200 OK).
155: 
156: You've successfully protected an endpoint using HTTP Basic Auth!
157: 
158: ## Other Common Schemes (Briefly)
159: 
160: The pattern is very similar for other schemes.
161: 
162: ### API Key in Header
163: 
164: ```python
165: # --- Imports ---
166: from fastapi.security import APIKeyHeader
167: 
168: # --- Scheme Instance ---
169: api_key_header_scheme = APIKeyHeader(name="X-API-KEY") # Expect key in X-API-KEY header
170: 
171: # --- Verifier Dependency (Example) ---
172: async def get_api_key(
173:     api_key: Annotated[str, Security(api_key_header_scheme)] # Use Security() with the SCHEME instance here
174: ):
175:     if api_key == "SECRET_API_KEY": # Check the key (use a secure way in real apps!)
176:         return api_key
177:     else:
178:         raise HTTPException(
179:             status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Could not validate API KEY"
180:         )
181: 
182: # --- Path Operation ---
183: @app.get("/secure-data")
184: async def get_secure_data(
185:     # Inject the VALIDATED key using Depends() - no need for Security() again
186:     # if the get_api_key dependency already uses Security() internally.
187:     # Alternatively, if get_api_key just returned the key without raising errors,
188:     # you could use Security(get_api_key) here. Let's stick to the pattern:
189:     # the verifier dependency uses Security(scheme), the endpoint uses Depends(verifier)
190:     # or directly uses Security(verifier) if the verifier handles errors.
191:     # Let's adjust get_api_key to make it cleaner:
192:     api_key: Annotated[str, Security(api_key_header_scheme)] # Scheme extracts the key
193: ):
194:     # Now, a separate check or use the key
195:     if api_key == "SECRET_API_KEY": # Re-checking here for simplicity, ideally done in a dependent function
196:          return {"data": "sensitive data", "api_key_used": api_key}
197:     else:
198:          # This path might not be reachable if auto_error=True in APIKeyHeader
199:          raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid API Key provided")
200: 
201: # Let's refine the API Key example pattern to match the Basic Auth pattern:
202: # Scheme Instance
203: api_key_header_scheme = APIKeyHeader(name="X-API-KEY", auto_error=False) # auto_error=False lets verifier handle missing key
204: 
205: # Verifier Dependency
206: async def verify_api_key(api_key: Annotated[str | None, Security(api_key_header_scheme)]):
207:     if api_key is None:
208:         raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="X-API-KEY header missing")
209:     if api_key == "SECRET_API_KEY":
210:         return api_key # Return key or user info associated with the key
211:     else:
212:         raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid API Key")
213: 
214: # Path Operation using the verifier
215: @app.get("/secure-data")
216: async def get_secure_data_v2(
217:     # Use Security() with the VERIFIER function
218:     verified_key: Annotated[str, Security(verify_api_key)]
219: ):
220:     # verified_key holds the result from verify_api_key (the validated key)
221:     return {"data": "sensitive data", "key": verified_key}
222: 
223: ```
224: 
225: ### OAuth2 Password Bearer Flow
226: 
227: This is common for user logins in web apps. It usually involves two endpoints: one to exchange username/password for a token (`/token`), and protected endpoints that require the token.
228: 
229: ```python
230: # --- Imports ---
231: from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
232: 
233: # --- Scheme Instance ---
234: # The 'tokenUrl' points to the path operation where users get the token
235: oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")
236: 
237: # --- Token Endpoint (Example) ---
238: @app.post("/token")
239: async def login_for_access_token(
240:     form_data: Annotated[OAuth2PasswordRequestForm, Depends()]
241: ):
242:     # 1. Verify form_data.username and form_data.password (check DB)
243:     # 2. If valid, create an access token (e.g., a JWT)
244:     # 3. Return the token
245:     # (Skipping implementation details for brevity)
246:     access_token = f"token_for_{form_data.username}" # Fake token
247:     return {"access_token": access_token, "token_type": "bearer"}
248: 
249: # --- Verifier Dependency (Example: decode token and get user) ---
250: async def get_current_user(token: Annotated[str, Security(oauth2_scheme)]):
251:     # In a real app:
252:     # 1. Decode the token (e.g., JWT)
253:     # 2. Validate the token (check expiry, signature)

269:     # Use Security() with the user verifier function
270:     current_user: Annotated[dict, Security(get_current_user)]
271: ):
272:     # current_user holds the dict returned by get_current_user
273:     return current_user
274: ```
275: 
276: The core pattern remains: Instantiate the scheme -> Define a verifier dependency that uses the scheme -> Protect endpoints using `Security(verifier_dependency)`.
277: 
278: ## How it Works Under the Hood (Simplified)
279: 
280: Let's trace the HTTP Basic Auth example (`GET /users/me` requiring `stanley`/`password123`):
281: 
282: 1.  **Request:** Client sends `GET /users/me` with header `Authorization: Basic c3RhbmxleTpwYXNzd29yZDEyMw==` (where `c3Rh...` is base64("stanley:password123")).
283: 2.  **Routing:** FastAPI matches the request to `read_current_user`.
284: 3.  **Dependency Analysis:** FastAPI sees `username: Annotated[str, Security(get_current_username)]`. It knows it needs to resolve the `get_current_username` dependency using the `Security` mechanism.
285: 4.  **Security Dependency Resolution:**
286:     *   FastAPI looks inside `get_current_username` and sees its dependency: `credentials: Annotated[HTTPBasicCredentials, Depends(security)]`.
287:     *   It needs to resolve `security` (our `HTTPBasic()` instance).
288: 5.  **Scheme Execution (`HTTPBasic.__call__`)**:
289:     *   FastAPI calls the `security` object (which is callable).
290:     *   The `HTTPBasic` object's `__call__` method executes. It reads the `Authorization` header from the request.
291:     *   It finds the `Basic` scheme and the parameter `c3RhbmxleTpwYXNzd29yZDEyMw==`.
292:     *   It base64-decodes the parameter to get `stanley:password123`.
293:     *   It splits this into username (`stanley`) and password (`password123`).
294:     *   It creates and returns an `HTTPBasicCredentials(username="stanley", password="password123")` object.
295:     *   *(If the header was missing or malformed, `HTTPBasic.__call__` would raise `HTTPException(401)` here, stopping the process).*
296: 6.  **Verifier Execution (`get_current_username`)**:
297:     *   FastAPI now has the result from `security`. It calls `get_current_username(credentials=<HTTPBasicCredentials object>)`.
298:     *   Your verifier code runs. It compares the credentials. They match the hardcoded values.
299:     *   The function returns the username `"stanley"`.
300:     *   *(If the credentials didn't match, your code would raise `HTTPException(401)` here, stopping the process).*
301: 7.  **Path Operation Execution (`read_current_user`)**:
302:     *   FastAPI now has the result from `get_current_username`. It calls `read_current_user(username="stanley")`.
303:     *   Your path operation function runs and returns `{"username": "stanley"}`.
304: 8.  **Response:** FastAPI sends the 200 OK JSON response back to the client.
305: 9.  **OpenAPI Generation:** Separately, when generating `/openapi.json`, FastAPI sees `Security(get_current_username)` -> `Depends(security)` -> `security` is `HTTPBasic`. It adds the "HTTPBasic" security requirement definition to the global `components.securitySchemes` and references it in the security requirements for the `/users/me` path operation. This is what makes the lock icon appear in `/docs`.

327:     PathOpFunc-->>-FastAPIApp: Return {"username": "stanley"}
328:     FastAPIApp-->>-Client: Send 200 OK JSON Response
329: ```
330: 
331: ## Code Connections
332: 
333: *   **`fastapi.Security`**: The function you import and use. It's a thin wrapper around `fastapi.params.Security`. (`fastapi/param_functions.py`)
334: *   **`fastapi.params.Security`**: The class that signals a security dependency, inheriting from `Depends` but adding the `scopes` parameter. (`fastapi/params.py`)
335: *   **`fastapi.security.*`**: This package contains the scheme implementations:
336:     *   `fastapi.security.http`: Contains `HTTPBase`, `HTTPBasic`, `HTTPBearer`, `HTTPDigest`, and the `HTTPBasicCredentials`, `HTTPAuthorizationCredentials` models.
337:     *   `fastapi.security.api_key`: Contains `APIKeyHeader`, `APIKeyQuery`, `APIKeyCookie`.
338:     *   `fastapi.security.oauth2`: Contains `OAuth2`, `OAuth2PasswordBearer`, `OAuth2AuthorizationCodeBearer`, `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`, `SecurityScopes`.
339: *   **Scheme `__call__` methods**: Each scheme class (e.g., `HTTPBasic`, `APIKeyHeader`, `OAuth2PasswordBearer`) implements `async def __call__(self, request: Request)` which contains the logic to extract credentials from the specific request location (headers, query, etc.).
340: *   **Dependency Injection System**: The core system described in [Chapter 5: Dependency Injection](05_dependency_injection.md) resolves the dependencies, calling the scheme instance and then your verifier function.
341: *   **OpenAPI Integration**: FastAPI's OpenAPI generation logic specifically checks for `Security` dependencies and uses the associated scheme model (`security.model`) to add the correct security requirements to the schema.
342: 
343: ## Conclusion
344: 
345: You've now learned the basics of securing your FastAPI endpoints!
346: 
347: *   You understand the need for **authentication** (who is the user?).
348: *   You know about common **security schemes** like HTTP Basic, API Keys, and OAuth2 Bearer tokens.
349: *   You learned that FastAPI provides **utility classes** (e.g., `HTTPBasic`, `APIKeyHeader`, `OAuth2PasswordBearer`) in the `fastapi.security` module to handle these schemes.
350: *   You saw how to use the **`Security()`** function (similar to `Depends()`) to integrate these schemes into your path operations via **verifier dependencies**.
351: *   You understand that `Security()` automatically adds security requirements to your **OpenAPI documentation** (`/docs`).
352: *   You grasped the core pattern: **Scheme Instance -> Verifier Dependency -> `Security(verifier)`**.
353: 
354: Using these tools allows you to easily add robust security layers to your API without reinventing the wheel.
355: 
356: Sometimes, after handling a request and sending a response, you might need to perform some follow-up actions, like sending a notification email or processing some data, without making the user wait. How can we do that?
357: 
358: Ready to run tasks in the background? Let's move on to [Chapter 8: Background Tasks](08_background_tasks.md)!

  8: # Chapter 8: Background Tasks
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 7: Security Utilities](07_security_utilities.md), we learned how to protect our API endpoints using FastAPI's security features. Now, let's explore how to perform actions *after* we've already sent a response back to the user.
 11: 
 12: ## What Problem Does This Solve?
 13: 
 14: Imagine a user registers on your website. When they submit their registration form, your API endpoint needs to:
 15: 
 16: 1.  Create the new user account in the database.
 17: 2.  Send a welcome email to the user.
 18: 3.  Send a notification to an admin.
 19: 4.  Return a "Success!" message to the user.
 20: 
 21: Creating the user (step 1) is quick and essential before confirming success. But sending emails or notifications (steps 2 and 3) can sometimes be slow. Should the user have to wait several extra seconds just for the emails to be sent before they see the "Success!" message? Probably not! It would be much better if the API could send the "Success!" response immediately after creating the user, and then handle sending the emails *in the background*.
 22: 
 23: This is exactly what **Background Tasks** allow you to do in FastAPI. They let you define operations that need to happen *after* the response has been sent to the client, ensuring your users get a fast response time for the main action.
 24: 
 25: **Analogy:** Think of your path operation function as having a conversation with the user (sending the response). Once the main conversation is finished, you might hand off a follow-up task (like mailing a letter) to an assistant to complete later, so you don't keep the user waiting. Background Tasks are like that helpful assistant.
 26: 
 27: ## Key Concepts
 28: 
 29: 1.  **`BackgroundTasks` Object:** A special object provided by FastAPI that holds a list of tasks to be run later.
 30: 2.  **Dependency Injection:** You get access to this object by declaring it as a parameter in your path operation function, just like we learned in [Chapter 5: Dependency Injection](05_dependency_injection.md). Example: `def my_endpoint(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks): ...`.
 31: 3.  **`add_task()` Method:** You use the `add_task()` method on the `BackgroundTasks` object to schedule a function to run in the background. You provide the function itself and any arguments it needs. Example: `background_tasks.add_task(send_welcome_email, user.email, user.name)`.
 32: 4.  **Post-Response Execution:** FastAPI (specifically, the underlying Starlette framework) ensures that all functions added via `add_task()` are executed *only after* the response has been successfully sent back to the client.
 33: 
 34: ## Using Background Tasks
 35: 
 36: Let's create a simple example. Imagine we want to write a message to a log file *after* sending a notification response to the user.
 37: 
 38: **Step 1: Import `BackgroundTasks`**
 39: 
 40: First, import the necessary class from `fastapi`.
 41: 
 42: ```python
 43: # main.py (or your router file)
 44: from fastapi import BackgroundTasks, FastAPI
 45: 
 46: app = FastAPI()
 47: ```
 48: 
 49: **Step 2: Define the Task Function**
 50: 
 51: This is the function you want to run in the background. It can be a regular `def` function or an `async def` function.
 52: 
 53: ```python
 54: # A function to simulate writing to a log
 55: # In a real app, this might send an email, process data, etc.
 56: def write_log(message: str):
 57:     # Simulate writing to a file
 58:     with open("log.txt", mode="a") as log_file:
 59:         log_file.write(message + "\n")
 60:     print(f"Log written: {message}") # Also print to console for demo
 61: 
 62: ```
 63: 
 64: **Explanation:**
 65: *   This is a simple Python function `write_log` that takes a `message` string.
 66: *   It opens a file named `log.txt` in "append" mode (`a`) and writes the message to it.
 67: *   We also print to the console so we can easily see when it runs during testing.
 68: 
 69: **Step 3: Inject `BackgroundTasks` and use `add_task`**
 70: 
 71: Now, modify your path operation function to accept `BackgroundTasks` as a parameter and use its `add_task` method.
 72: 
 73: ```python
 74: @app.post("/send-notification/{email}")
 75: async def send_notification(
 76:     email: str,
 77:     background_tasks: BackgroundTasks # Inject BackgroundTasks
 78: ):
 79:     # The message we want to log in the background
 80:     log_message = f"Notification sent to: {email}"
 81: 
 82:     # Add the task to run after the response
 83:     background_tasks.add_task(write_log, log_message) # Schedule write_log
 84: 
 85:     # Return the response immediately
 86:     return {"message": "Notification sent successfully!"}
 87: 
 88: ```
 89: 
 90: **Explanation:**
 91: 
 92: *   `background_tasks: BackgroundTasks`: We declare a parameter named `background_tasks` with the type hint `BackgroundTasks`. FastAPI's dependency injection system will automatically create and provide a `BackgroundTasks` object here.
 93: *   `background_tasks.add_task(write_log, log_message)`: This is the crucial line.
 94:     *   We call the `add_task` method on the injected `background_tasks` object.
 95:     *   The first argument is the function we want to run in the background (`write_log`).
 96:     *   The subsequent arguments (`log_message`) are the arguments that will be passed to our `write_log` function when it's eventually called.
 97: *   `return {"message": "Notification sent successfully!"}`: The function returns its response *without* waiting for `write_log` to finish.
 98: 
 99: **How it Behaves:**
100: 
101: 1.  **Run the App:** `uvicorn main:app --reload`
102: 2.  **Send a Request:** Use `curl` or the `/docs` UI to send a `POST` request to `/send-notification/test@example.com`.
103:     ```bash
104:     curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/send-notification/test@example.com
105:     ```
106: 3.  **Immediate Response:** You will immediately receive the JSON response:
107:     ```json
108:     {"message":"Notification sent successfully!"}
109:     ```
110: 4.  **Background Execution:** *After* the response above has been sent, look at your Uvicorn console output. You will see the message:
111:     ```
112:     Log written: Notification sent to: test@example.com
113:     ```
114:     Also, check your project directory. A file named `log.txt` will have been created (or appended to) with the content:
115:     ```
116:     Notification sent to: test@example.com
117:     ```
118: 
119: This demonstrates that the `write_log` function ran *after* the client received the success message, preventing any delay for the user.
120: 
121: ## How it Works Under the Hood (Simplified)
122: 
123: What's happening behind the scenes when you use `BackgroundTasks`?
124: 
125: 1.  **Request In:** A request arrives at your FastAPI application (e.g., `POST /send-notification/test@example.com`).
126: 2.  **Dependency Injection:** FastAPI processes the request, routes it to `send_notification`, and prepares its dependencies. It sees the `background_tasks: BackgroundTasks` parameter and creates an empty `BackgroundTasks` object instance.
127: 3.  **Path Function Runs:** Your `send_notification` function is called with the `email` and the empty `background_tasks` object.
128: 4.  **`add_task` Called:** Your code calls `background_tasks.add_task(write_log, log_message)`. This doesn't *run* `write_log` yet; it just adds the function (`write_log`) and its arguments (`log_message`) to an internal list within the `background_tasks` object.
129: 5.  **Response Returned:** Your path function finishes and returns the dictionary `{"message": "Notification sent successfully!"}`.
130: 6.  **Middleware Magic (Starlette):** FastAPI (using Starlette middleware) takes the response object *and* the `background_tasks` object (which now contains the scheduled task).
131: 7.  **Response Sent:** The middleware sends the HTTP response (`200 OK` with the JSON body) back to the client over the network.
132: 8.  **Tasks Executed:** *After* the response has been sent, the Starlette middleware iterates through the tasks stored in the `background_tasks` object. For each task, it calls the stored function (`write_log`) with the stored arguments (`log_message`). This happens in the server's process, separate from the initial request-response flow.
133: 
134: Here's a simplified sequence diagram:
135: 
136: ```mermaid
137: sequenceDiagram
138:     participant Client
139:     participant FastAPIApp as FastAPI App (via Starlette)
140:     participant PathFunc as send_notification
141:     participant BGTasks as BackgroundTasks Object
142:     participant BGExecutor as Background Task Executor (Starlette)
143:     participant TaskFunc as write_log
144: 
145:     Client->>+FastAPIApp: POST /send-notification/test@example.com
146:     FastAPIApp->>FastAPIApp: Route to send_notification
147:     FastAPIApp->>+PathFunc: Call send_notification(email="...", background_tasks=BGTasks)
148:     PathFunc->>+BGTasks: background_tasks.add_task(write_log, "...")
149:     BGTasks-->>-PathFunc: Task added to internal list
150:     PathFunc-->>-FastAPIApp: Return response {"message": "..."}
151:     Note over FastAPIApp: FastAPI/Starlette prepares to send response AND notes background tasks
152:     FastAPIApp-->>-Client: Send HTTP 200 OK Response
153:     Note over FastAPIApp: Response sent, now run background tasks
154:     FastAPIApp->>+BGExecutor: Execute tasks from BGTasks object
155:     BGExecutor->>+TaskFunc: Call write_log("...")
156:     TaskFunc->>TaskFunc: Write to log.txt
157:     TaskFunc-->>-BGExecutor: Task finished
158:     BGExecutor-->>-FastAPIApp: All tasks finished
159: ```
160: 
161: ### Code Connections
162: 
163: *   **`fastapi.BackgroundTasks`**: This class (in `fastapi/background.py`) inherits directly from `starlette.background.BackgroundTasks`. It mostly just provides type hints and documentation specific to FastAPI.
164: *   **`BackgroundTasks.add_task`**: This method simply calls the `add_task` method of the parent Starlette class.
165: *   **`starlette.background.BackgroundTasks`**: This is where the core logic resides (in the `starlette` library, which FastAPI builds upon). It stores tasks as tuples of `(callable, args, kwargs)`.
166: *   **`starlette.middleware.exceptions.ExceptionMiddleware` (and potentially others):** Starlette's middleware stack, particularly around exception handling and response sending, is responsible for checking if a `BackgroundTasks` object exists on the response object after the main endpoint code has run. If tasks exist, the middleware ensures they are executed *after* the response is sent using `anyio.create_task_group().start_soon()` or similar mechanisms. See `starlette.responses.Response.__call__`.
167: 
168: Essentially, FastAPI provides a convenient way (via dependency injection) to access Starlette's background task functionality.
169: 
170: ## Conclusion
171: 
172: You've learned how to use FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` to perform operations *after* sending a response to the client!
173: 
174: *   You understand that this is useful for **slow or non-critical tasks** (like sending emails or notifications) that shouldn't delay the user's primary action.
175: *   You learned to inject the **`BackgroundTasks`** object as a dependency.
176: *   You saw how to schedule functions using the **`add_task(func, *args, **kwargs)`** method.
177: *   You understand that these tasks run **after the response** has been delivered.
178: 
179: This feature helps you build more responsive APIs by deferring non-essential work.
180: 
181: This chapter concludes our core introduction to FastAPI! We've covered setting up applications, defining routes, handling parameters and data validation, using dependency injection, handling errors, securing endpoints, and now running background tasks. With these building blocks, you can create powerful and efficient web APIs.
182: 
183: Where do you go from here? You can dive deeper into the official FastAPI documentation to explore advanced topics like WebSockets, middleware, bigger application structures, testing, and deployment. Happy coding!

  8: # Chapter 1: Application Object (`Flask`)
  9: 
 10: Welcome to your first step into the world of Flask! Flask is a "microframework" for building web applications in Python. "Micro" doesn't mean it's limited; it means Flask provides the essentials to get started quickly, letting you add features as needed.
 11: 
 12: In this chapter, we'll explore the absolute heart of any Flask application: the **Application Object**.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does It Solve? The Need for a Control Tower
 15: 
 16: Imagine you're building a simple website. Maybe it just needs to show "Hello, World!" when someone visits the homepage. How does the web server know *what* Python code to run when a request comes in for `/` (the homepage)? How does it manage different pages (like `/about` or `/contact`)? How does it handle settings or connect to other tools?
 17: 
 18: You need a central place to manage all these tasks. Think of a busy airport: you need a **control tower** to direct planes (incoming web requests), manage runways (URL paths), and coordinate ground crew (other parts of your application).
 19: 
 20: In Flask, the `Flask` object is that control tower. It's the main object you create that represents your entire web application.
 21: 
 22: ## Creating Your First Flask Application
 23: 
 24: Let's create the simplest possible Flask app. You'll need a Python file (let's call it `hello.py`).
 25: 
 26: 1.  **Import Flask:** First, you need to bring the `Flask` class into your code.
 27: 2.  **Create an Instance:** Then, you create an *instance* of this class. This instance *is* your application.
 28: 
 29: ```python
 30: # hello.py
 31: 
 32: from flask import Flask
 33: 
 34: # Create the application object
 35: app = Flask(__name__)
 36: 
 37: # We'll add more here soon!
 38: ```
 39: 
 40: Let's break down `app = Flask(__name__)`:
 41: 
 42: *   `from flask import Flask`: This line imports the necessary `Flask` class from the Flask library you installed.
 43: *   `app = Flask(...)`: This creates the actual application object. We usually call the variable `app`, but you could name it something else.
 44: *   `__name__`: This is a special Python variable. When you run a Python script directly, Python sets `__name__` to the string `"__main__"`. If the script is imported by another script, `__name__` is set to the module's name (e.g., `"hello"` if your file is `hello.py`).
 45:     *   **Why `__name__`?** Flask uses this argument to figure out the *location* of your application. This helps it find other files like templates and static assets (images, CSS) later on. For simple, single-module applications, using `__name__` is standard practice and almost always correct. The Flask documentation notes that if you're building a larger application structured as a Python package, you might hardcode the package name instead (like `app = Flask('yourapplication')`), but for beginners, `__name__` is the way to go.
 46: 
 47: This `app` object is now ready to be configured and run.
 48: 
 49: ## Adding a Basic Route
 50: 
 51: Our `app` object doesn't do anything yet. Let's tell it what to do when someone visits the homepage (`/`). We do this using a *route*. We'll cover routing in detail in the next chapter, but here's a taste:
 52: 
 53: ```python
 54: # hello.py (continued)
 55: 
 56: from flask import Flask
 57: 
 58: app = Flask(__name__)
 59: 
 60: # Define what happens when someone visits the homepage ("/")
 61: @app.route('/')
 62: def index():
 63:   return 'Hello, World!'
 64: 
 65: # More code to run the app below...
 66: ```
 67: 
 68: *   `@app.route('/')`: This is a Python decorator. It modifies the function defined right below it (`index`). It tells our `app` object: "When a web request comes in for the URL path `/`, call the `index` function."
 69: *   `def index(): ...`: This is a simple Python function. Flask calls these "view functions."
 70: *   `return 'Hello, World!'`: Whatever the view function returns is sent back to the user's web browser as the response.
 71: 
 72: ## Running Your Application
 73: 
 74: How do we start the web server so people can actually visit our page? We use the `app` object's `run()` method. It's common practice to put this inside a special `if` block:
 75: 
 76: ```python
 77: # hello.py (end of the file)
 78: 
 79: from flask import Flask
 80: 
 81: app = Flask(__name__)
 82: 
 83: @app.route('/')
 84: def index():
 85:   return 'Hello, World!'
 86: 
 87: # This block runs the app only when the script is executed directly
 88: if __name__ == '__main__':
 89:   # Start the built-in development server
 90:   app.run(debug=True)
 91: ```
 92: 
 93: *   `if __name__ == '__main__':`: This standard Python construct ensures that the code inside it only runs when you execute `hello.py` directly (like typing `python hello.py` in your terminal). It prevents the server from starting if you were to *import* `hello.py` into another Python file.
 94: *   `app.run()`: This method starts Flask's built-in development web server. This server is great for testing but **not** suitable for production (live websites).
 95: *   `debug=True`: This enables Flask's "debug mode". It provides helpful error messages in the browser and automatically restarts the server whenever you save changes to your code, making development much easier. **Never use debug mode in production!**
 96: 
 97: **To run this:**
 98: 
 99: 1.  Save the complete code as `hello.py`.
100: 2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
101: 3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
102: 4.  Run the command: `python hello.py`
103: 5.  You'll see output like this:
104:     ```
105:      * Serving Flask app 'hello'
106:      * Debug mode: on
107:      * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
108:      * Restarting with stat
109:      * Debugger is active!
110:      * Debugger PIN: ...
111:     ```
112: 6.  Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
113: 7.  You should see the text "Hello, World!"
114: 
115: You've just created and run your first Flask application! The `app = Flask(__name__)` line was the crucial first step, creating the central object that manages everything.
116: 
117: ## Under the Hood: What Happens When You Create `Flask(__name__)`?
118: 
119: While you don't *need* to know the deep internals right away, a little insight helps understanding. When you call `app = Flask(__name__)`, several things happen inside Flask (simplified):
120: 
121: 1.  **Initialization:** The `Flask` class's `__init__` method (found in `app.py`, inheriting from `App` in `sansio/app.py`) is called.
122: 2.  **Path Determination:** It uses the `import_name` (`__name__`) you passed to figure out the application's `root_path`. This is like finding the main hangar at the airport. (See `get_root_path` in `helpers.py` and `find_package` in `sansio/scaffold.py`).
123: 3.  **Configuration Setup:** It creates a configuration object (`self.config`), usually an instance of the `Config` class (from `config.py`). This object holds settings like `DEBUG`, `SECRET_KEY`, etc. We'll cover this in [Configuration (`Config`)](06_configuration___config__.md).
124: 4.  **URL Map Creation:** It creates a `URL Map` (`self.url_map`), which is responsible for matching incoming request URLs to your view functions. This is core to the [Routing System](02_routing_system.md).
125: 5.  **Internal Structures:** It sets up various internal dictionaries to store things like your view functions (`self.view_functions`), error handlers (`self.error_handler_spec`), functions to run before/after requests, etc.
126: 6.  **Static Route (Optional):** If you configured a `static_folder` (Flask does by default), it automatically adds a URL rule (like `/static/<filename>`) to serve static files like CSS and JavaScript.
127: 
128: Here's a simplified diagram of the process:
129: 
130: ```mermaid
131: sequenceDiagram
132:     participant UserCode as hello.py
133:     participant Flask as Flask(__init__)
134:     participant App as Base App(__init__)
135:     participant Config as Config()
136:     participant URLMap as URL Map()
137: 
138:     UserCode->>+Flask: app = Flask(__name__)
139:     Flask->>+App: Initialize base features (paths, folders)
140:     App-->>-Flask: Base initialized
141:     Flask->>+Config: Create config object (self.config)
142:     Config-->>-Flask: Config ready
143:     Flask->>+URLMap: Create URL map (self.url_map)
144:     URLMap-->>-Flask: Map ready
145:     Flask-->>-UserCode: Return Flask instance (app)
146: ```
147: 
148: The `app` object returned is now the fully initialized "control tower," ready to register routes and handle requests.
149: 
150: ## Conclusion
151: 
152: You've learned about the most fundamental concept in Flask: the **Application Object**, created by instantiating the `Flask` class (usually as `app = Flask(__name__)`). This object acts as the central registry and controller for your entire web application. It's where you define URL routes, manage configuration, and connect various components.
153: 
154: We saw how to create a minimal application, add a simple route using `@app.route()`, and run the development server using `app.run()`.
155: 
156: Now that you have your central `app` object, the next logical step is to understand how Flask directs incoming web requests to the correct Python functions. That's the job of the routing system.
157: 
158: Ready to direct some traffic? Let's move on to [Routing System](02_routing_system.md).

  8: # Chapter 2: Routing System
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 1: Application Object (`Flask`)](01_application_object___flask__.md), we learned how to create the central `app` object, the control tower for our Flask application. We even added a simple "Hello, World!" page using `@app.route('/')`.
 11: 
 12: But how did Flask know that visiting the homepage (`/`) should run our `index()` function? And how can we create more pages, like an "About Us" page at `/about`? That's where the **Routing System** comes in.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does It Solve? The Need for Directions
 15: 
 16: Imagine you have a website with multiple pages: a homepage, an about page, a contact page, maybe even pages for individual user profiles. When a user types a URL like `http://yourwebsite.com/about` into their browser, how does your Flask application know *which* piece of Python code should handle this request and generate the "About Us" content?
 17: 
 18: You need a system to map these incoming URLs to the specific Python functions that generate the response for each page. Think of it like a city map's index:
 19: 
 20: *   **URL:** The street address you want to find (e.g., `/about`).
 21: *   **Routing System:** The index in the map book.
 22: *   **View Function:** The specific page number in the map book that shows the details for that address.
 23: 
 24: Flask's routing system, largely powered by a library called Werkzeug, acts as this index. It lets you define URL patterns (like `/` or `/about` or `/user/<username>`) and connect them to your Python functions (called **view functions**).
 25: 
 26: ## Defining Routes with `@app.route()`
 27: 
 28: In Flask, the most common way to define these URL-to-function mappings is using the `@app.route()` decorator, which we briefly saw in Chapter 1.
 29: 
 30: Let's revisit our `hello.py` and add an "About" page.
 31: 
 32: 1.  We keep the route for the homepage (`/`).
 33: 2.  We add a *new* route for `/about`.
 34: 
 35: ```python
 36: # hello.py
 37: 
 38: from flask import Flask
 39: 
 40: # Create the application object from Chapter 1
 41: app = Flask(__name__)
 42: 
 43: # Route for the homepage
 44: @app.route('/')
 45: def index():
 46:   return 'Welcome to the Homepage!'
 47: 
 48: # NEW: Route for the about page
 49: @app.route('/about')
 50: def about():
 51:   return 'This is the About Us page.'
 52: 
 53: # Code to run the app (from Chapter 1)
 54: if __name__ == '__main__':
 55:   app.run(debug=True)
 56: ```
 57: 
 58: **Explanation:**
 59: 
 60: *   `@app.route('/')`: This tells Flask: "If a request comes in for the URL path `/`, execute the function directly below (`index`)."
 61: *   `@app.route('/about')`: This tells Flask: "If a request comes in for the URL path `/about`, execute the function directly below (`about`)."
 62: *   `def index(): ...` and `def about(): ...`: These are our **view functions**. They contain the Python code that runs for their respective routes and must return the response to send back to the browser.
 63: 
 64: **Running this:**
 65: 
 66: 1.  Save the code as `hello.py`.
 67: 2.  Run `python hello.py` in your terminal.
 68: 3.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser. You should see "Welcome to the Homepage!".
 69: 4.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/about`. You should see "This is the About Us page.".
 70: 
 71: See? The routing system directed each URL to the correct view function!
 72: 
 73: ## Dynamic Routes: Using Variables in URLs
 74: 
 75: What if you want pages that change based on the URL? For example, a profile page for different users like `/user/alice` and `/user/bob`. You don't want to write a new view function for every single user!
 76: 
 77: Flask allows you to define *variable parts* in your URL rules using angle brackets `< >`.
 78: 
 79: Let's create a dynamic route to greet users:
 80: 
 81: ```python
 82: # hello.py (continued)
 83: 
 84: # ... (keep Flask import, app creation, index, and about routes) ...
 85: 
 86: # NEW: Dynamic route for user profiles
 87: @app.route('/user/<username>')
 88: def show_user_profile(username):
 89:   # The 'username' variable from the URL is passed to the function!
 90:   return f'Hello, {username}!'
 91: 
 92: # ... (keep the if __name__ == '__main__': block) ...
 93: ```
 94: 
 95: **Explanation:**
 96: 
 97: *   `@app.route('/user/<username>')`:
 98:     *   The `/user/` part is fixed.
 99:     *   `<username>` is a **variable placeholder**. Flask will match any text here (like `alice`, `bob`, `123`) and capture it.
100: *   `def show_user_profile(username):`:
101:     *   Notice the function now accepts an argument named `username`. This **must match** the variable name used in the angle brackets in the route.
102:     *   Flask automatically passes the value captured from the URL to this argument.
103: *   `return f'Hello, {username}!'`: We use an f-string to include the captured username in the response.
104: 
105: **Running this:**
106: 
107: 1.  Save the updated `hello.py` (make sure `debug=True` is still set so the server restarts).
108: 2.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/Alice`. You should see "Hello, Alice!".
109: 3.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/Bob`. You should see "Hello, Bob!".
110: 
111: Flask's routing system matched both URLs to the same rule (`/user/<username>`) and passed the different usernames (`'Alice'`, `'Bob'`) to the `show_user_profile` function.
112: 
113: ## Specifying Data Types: Converters
114: 
115: By default, variables captured from the URL are treated as strings. But what if you need a number? For example, displaying blog post number 5 at `/post/5`. You might want Flask to ensure that only numbers are accepted for that part of the URL.
116: 
117: You can specify a **converter** inside the angle brackets using `<converter:variable_name>`.
118: 
119: Let's add a route for blog posts using the `int` converter:
120: 
121: ```python
122: # hello.py (continued)
123: 
124: # ... (keep previous code) ...
125: 
126: # NEW: Route for displaying a specific blog post by ID
127: @app.route('/post/<int:post_id>')
128: def show_post(post_id):
129:   # Flask ensures post_id is an integer and passes it here
130:   # Note: We are just showing the ID, not actually fetching a post
131:   return f'Showing Post Number: {post_id} (Type: {type(post_id).__name__})'
132: 
133: # ... (keep the if __name__ == '__main__': block) ...
134: ```
135: 
136: **Explanation:**
137: 
138: *   `@app.route('/post/<int:post_id>')`:
139:     *   `<int:post_id>` tells Flask: "Match this part of the URL, but only if it looks like an integer. Convert it to an integer and pass it as the `post_id` variable."
140: *   `def show_post(post_id):`: The `post_id` argument will now receive an actual Python `int`.
141: 
142: **Running this:**
143: 
144: 1.  Save the updated `hello.py`.
145: 2.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/post/123`. You should see "Showing Post Number: 123 (Type: int)".
146: 3.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/post/abc`. You'll get a "Not Found" error! Why? Because `abc` doesn't match the `int` converter, so Flask doesn't consider this URL to match the rule.
147: 
148: Common converters include:
149: 
150: *   `string`: (Default) Accepts any text without a slash.
151: *   `int`: Accepts positive integers.
152: *   `float`: Accepts positive floating-point values.
153: *   `path`: Like `string` but also accepts slashes (useful for matching file paths).
154: *   `uuid`: Accepts UUID strings.
155: 
156: ## Under the Hood: How Does Routing Work?
157: 
158: You don't *need* to know the deep internals, but understanding the basics helps.
159: 
160: When you define routes using `@app.route()`, Flask doesn't immediately check URLs. Instead, it builds a map, like pre-compiling that map index we talked about.
161: 
162: 1.  **Building the Map:**
163:     *   When you create your `app = Flask(__name__)` ([Chapter 1](01_application_object___flask__.md)), Flask initializes an empty `URLMap` object (from the Werkzeug library, stored in `app.url_map`). See `Flask.__init__` in `app.py` which calls `super().__init__` in `sansio/app.py`, which creates the `self.url_map`.
164:     *   Each time you use `@app.route('/some/rule', ...)` or directly call `app.add_url_rule(...)` (see `sansio/scaffold.py`), Flask creates a `Rule` object (like `Rule('/user/<username>')`) describing the pattern, the allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), the endpoint name (usually the function name), and any converters.
165:     *   This `Rule` object is added to the `app.url_map`.
166: 
167: 2.  **Matching a Request:**
168:     *   When a request like `GET /user/Alice` arrives, Flask's `wsgi_app` method (in `app.py`) gets called.
169:     *   It uses the `app.url_map` and the incoming request environment (URL path, HTTP method) to find a matching `Rule`. Werkzeug's `MapAdapter.match()` method (created via `app.create_url_adapter` which calls `url_map.bind_to_environ`) does the heavy lifting here.
170:     *   If a match is found for `/user/<username>`, `match()` returns the endpoint name (e.g., `'show_user_profile'`) and a dictionary of the extracted variables (e.g., `{'username': 'Alice'}`). These get stored on the `request` object ([Chapter 3](03_request_and_response_objects.md)) as `request.url_rule` and `request.view_args`.
171:     *   If no rule matches, a "Not Found" (404) error is raised.
172: 
173: 3.  **Dispatching to the View Function:**
174:     *   Flask's `app.dispatch_request()` method (in `app.py`) takes the endpoint name from `request.url_rule.endpoint`.
175:     *   It looks up the actual Python view function associated with that endpoint name in the `app.view_functions` dictionary (which `@app.route` also populated).
176:     *   It calls the view function, passing the extracted variables from `request.view_args` as keyword arguments (e.g., `show_user_profile(username='Alice')`).
177:     *   The return value of the view function becomes the response.
178: 
179: Here's a simplified diagram of the matching process:
180: 
181: ```mermaid
182: sequenceDiagram
183:     participant Browser
184:     participant FlaskApp as app.wsgi_app
185:     participant URLMap as url_map.bind(...).match()
186:     participant ViewFunc as show_user_profile()
187: 
188:     Browser->>+FlaskApp: GET /user/Alice
189:     FlaskApp->>+URLMap: Match path '/user/Alice' and method 'GET'?
190:     URLMap-->>-FlaskApp: Match found! Endpoint='show_user_profile', Args={'username': 'Alice'}
191:     FlaskApp->>+ViewFunc: Call show_user_profile(username='Alice')
192:     ViewFunc-->>-FlaskApp: Return 'Hello, Alice!'
193:     FlaskApp-->>-Browser: Send response 'Hello, Alice!'
194: ```
195: 
196: The key takeaway is that `@app.route` builds a map upfront, and Werkzeug efficiently searches this map for each incoming request to find the right function and extract any variable parts.
197: 
198: ## Conclusion
199: 
200: You've learned how Flask's **Routing System** acts as a map between URLs and the Python functions (view functions) that handle them.
201: 
202: *   We use the `@app.route()` decorator to define URL rules.
203: *   We can create static routes (like `/about`) and dynamic routes using variables (`/user/<username>`).
204: *   Converters (`<int:post_id>`) allow us to specify the expected data type for URL variables, providing automatic validation and conversion.
205: *   Under the hood, Flask and Werkzeug build a `URLMap` from these rules and use it to efficiently dispatch incoming requests to the correct view function.
206: 
207: Now that we know how to direct requests to the right functions, what information comes *with* a request (like form data or query parameters)? And how do we properly format the data we send *back*? That's where the Request and Response objects come in.
208: 
209: Let's dive into [Chapter 3: Request and Response Objects](03_request_and_response_objects.md).

  8: # Chapter 3: Request and Response Objects
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 2: Routing System](02_routing_system.md), we learned how Flask uses routes (`@app.route(...)`) to direct incoming web requests to the correct Python view functions. We saw how to create static routes like `/about` and dynamic routes like `/user/<username>`.
 11: 
 12: But what exactly *is* a "web request"? And how do we send back something more sophisticated than just a plain string like `'Hello, World!'`? That's where **Request** and **Response** objects come into play.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Do They Solve? The Need for Envelopes
 15: 
 16: Think about sending and receiving mail. When you receive a letter, it's not just the message inside that matters. The envelope has important information: the sender's address, the recipient's address, maybe a stamp indicating priority. When you send a letter back, you also need an envelope to put your message in, address it correctly, and maybe specify if it's regular mail or express.
 17: 
 18: In the world of web applications (specifically HTTP, the language browsers and servers speak):
 19: 
 20: *   The **Request** object is like the *incoming mail*. It contains everything the client (usually a web browser) sent to your server: the URL they requested, any data they submitted (like in a search box or login form), special instructions (HTTP headers), the method they used (like GET for fetching data or POST for submitting data), and more.
 21: *   The **Response** object is like the *outgoing mail* you send back. It contains the content you want to show the user (like an HTML page), the status of the request (like "OK" or "Not Found"), and any special instructions for the browser (HTTP headers, like instructions on how to cache the page).
 22: 
 23: Flask provides easy-to-use objects to represent these two sides of the communication.
 24: 
 25: ## The Request Object: Unpacking the Incoming Mail
 26: 
 27: Inside your view functions, Flask makes a special object called `request` available. You need to import it from the `flask` library first. This object holds all the information about the incoming request that triggered your view function.
 28: 
 29: ```python
 30: # hello.py (continued)
 31: from flask import Flask, request # Import request
 32: 
 33: app = Flask(__name__)
 34: 
 35: @app.route('/')
 36: def index():
 37:   # Access the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
 38:   method = request.method
 39:   # Access the browser's user agent string (an HTTP header)
 40:   user_agent = request.headers.get('User-Agent')
 41:   return f'Hello! You used the {method} method. Your browser is: {user_agent}'
 42: 
 43: # ... (rest of the app, including if __name__ == '__main__': ...)
 44: ```
 45: 
 46: **Explanation:**
 47: 
 48: *   `from flask import request`: We import the `request` object.
 49: *   `request.method`: This attribute tells you *how* the user made the request (e.g., 'GET', 'POST'). Visiting a page normally uses GET.
 50: *   `request.headers`: This is a dictionary-like object containing HTTP headers sent by the browser. We use `.get('User-Agent')` to safely get the browser identification string.
 51: 
 52: **Running this:**
 53: 
 54: 1.  Save and run `hello.py`.
 55: 2.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser.
 56: 3.  You'll see something like: "Hello! You used the GET method. Your browser is: Mozilla/5.0 (..." (your specific browser details will vary).
 57: 
 58: ### Getting Data from the URL (Query Parameters)
 59: 
 60: Often, data is included directly in the URL after a `?`, like `http://127.0.0.1:5000/search?query=flask`. These are called query parameters. The `request` object provides the `args` attribute to access them.
 61: 
 62: ```python
 63: # hello.py (continued)
 64: from flask import Flask, request
 65: 
 66: app = Flask(__name__)
 67: 
 68: @app.route('/search')
 69: def search():
 70:   # Get the value of the 'query' parameter from the URL
 71:   # request.args.get() is safer than request.args[] as it returns None if the key doesn't exist
 72:   search_term = request.args.get('query')
 73: 
 74:   if search_term:
 75:     return f'You searched for: {search_term}'
 76:   else:
 77:     return 'Please provide a search term using ?query=...'
 78: 
 79: # ... (rest of the app)
 80: ```
 81: 
 82: **Running this:**
 83: 
 84: 1.  Save and run `hello.py`.
 85: 2.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/search?query=python+web+framework`.
 86: 3.  You should see: "You searched for: python web framework".
 87: 4.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/search`.
 88: 5.  You should see: "Please provide a search term using ?query=..."
 89: 
 90: ### Getting Data from Forms (POST Requests)
 91: 
 92: When a user submits an HTML form, the browser usually sends the data using the POST method. This data isn't in the URL; it's in the body of the request. The `request` object provides the `form` attribute to access this data.
 93: 
 94: Let's create a simple login page (we won't actually log anyone in yet).
 95: 
 96: First, a route to *show* the form (using GET):
 97: 
 98: ```python
 99: # hello.py (continued)
100: from flask import Flask, request, make_response # Import make_response
101: 
102: app = Flask(__name__)
103: 
104: @app.route('/login', methods=['GET']) # Only allow GET for this view
105: def show_login_form():
106:   # Just return the raw HTML for the form
107:   return '''
108:       <form method="POST">
109:           Username: <input type="text" name="username"><br>
110:           Password: <input type="password" name="password"><br>
111:           <input type="submit" value="Log In">
112:       </form>
113:   '''
114: # ... (add the next route below)
115: ```
116: 
117: Now, a route to *handle* the form submission (using POST):
118: 
119: ```python
120: # hello.py (continued)
121: 
122: @app.route('/login', methods=['POST']) # Only allow POST for this view
123: def process_login():
124:   # Access form data using request.form
125:   username = request.form.get('username')
126:   password = request.form.get('password') # In a real app, NEVER just display a password!
127: 
128:   if username and password:
129:     return f'Attempting login for username: {username}'
130:   else:
131:     return 'Missing username or password', 400 # Return an error status code
132: 
133: # ... (rest of the app, including if __name__ == '__main__': ...)
134: ```
135: 
136: **Explanation:**
137: 
138: *   `@app.route('/login', methods=['GET'])`: We specify that `show_login_form` only handles GET requests.
139: *   `@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])`: We specify that `process_login` only handles POST requests. This allows the same URL (`/login`) to do different things based on the HTTP method.
140: *   `<form method="POST">`: The HTML form is set to use the POST method when submitted.
141: *   `request.form.get('username')`: Inside `process_login`, we access the submitted form data using the `name` attributes of the input fields (`name="username"`).
142: *   `return 'Missing...', 400`: Here we return not just a string, but also a number. Flask understands this as `(body, status_code)`. `400` means "Bad Request".
143: 
144: **Running this:**
145: 
146: 1.  Save and run `hello.py`.
147: 2.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/login`. You'll see the simple login form.
148: 3.  Enter a username and password and click "Log In".
149: 4.  The browser will send a POST request to `/login`. The `process_login` function will handle it, and you'll see: "Attempting login for username: [your username]".
150: 
151: The `request` object is your window into the data sent by the client. You'll use `request.args` for URL parameters (GET) and `request.form` for form data (POST) most often.
152: 
153: ## The Response Object: Crafting the Outgoing Mail
154: 
155: We've seen that Flask takes the return value of your view function and turns it into the HTTP response sent back to the browser.
156: 
157: *   Returning a string: Flask creates a Response with that string as the body, a `200 OK` status code, and a `text/html` content type.
158: *   Returning a tuple `(body, status)`: Flask uses the `body` (string) and the specified `status` code (integer).
159: *   Returning a tuple `(body, status, headers)`: Flask uses the body, status, and adds the specified `headers` (a dictionary or list of tuples).
160: 
161: For more control, you can explicitly create a Response object using the `make_response` helper function.
162: 
163: ```python
164: # hello.py (continued)
165: from flask import Flask, make_response # Import make_response
166: 
167: app = Flask(__name__)
168: 
169: @app.route('/custom')
170: def custom_response():
171:   # Create a response object from a string
172:   response = make_response("This response has custom headers!")
173: 
174:   # Set a custom header
175:   response.headers['X-My-Custom-Header'] = 'Flask is Fun!'
176: 
177:   # Set a cookie (we'll learn more about sessions/cookies later)
178:   response.set_cookie('mycookie', 'some_value')
179: 
180:   # Set a specific status code (optional, defaults to 200)
181:   response.status_code = 201 # 201 means "Created"
182: 
183:   return response # Return the fully configured response object
184: 
185: # ... (rest of the app)
186: ```
187: 
188: **Explanation:**
189: 
190: *   `from flask import make_response`: We import the helper function.
191: *   `response = make_response(...)`: Creates a Response object. You can pass the body content here.
192: *   `response.headers['...'] = '...'`: Allows setting custom HTTP headers. Browsers might use these for caching, security, or other purposes. Your own JavaScript code could also read them.
193: *   `response.set_cookie(...)`: A convenient way to set a cookie to be stored by the browser.
194: *   `response.status_code = 201`: Sets the HTTP status code. While `200` means "OK", other codes have specific meanings (`404` Not Found, `403` Forbidden, `500` Server Error, `201` Created, `302` Redirect, etc.).
195: *   `return response`: We return the response object we manually configured.
196: 
197: Using `make_response` gives you fine-grained control over exactly what gets sent back to the client.
198: 
199: ## Under the Hood: Werkzeug and the Request/Response Cycle
200: 
201: Flask doesn't reinvent the wheel for handling low-level HTTP details. It uses another excellent Python library called **Werkzeug** (pronounced "verk-zoyg", German for "tool"). Flask's `Request` and `Response` objects are actually subclasses of Werkzeug's base `Request` and `Response` classes, adding some Flask-specific conveniences.
202: 
203: Here's a simplified view of what happens when a request comes in:
204: 
205: 1.  **Incoming Request:** Your web server (like the Flask development server, or a production server like Gunicorn/uWSGI) receives the raw HTTP request from the browser.
206: 2.  **WSGI Environment:** The server translates this raw request into a standard Python dictionary called the WSGI `environ`. This dictionary contains all the request details (path, method, headers, input stream, etc.).
207: 3.  **Flask App Called:** The server calls your Flask application object (`app`) as a WSGI application, passing it the `environ`. (See `app.wsgi_app` in `app.py`).
208: 4.  **Request Context:** Flask creates a **Request Context**. This involves:
209:     *   Creating a `Request` object (usually `flask.wrappers.Request`) by feeding it the `environ`. Werkzeug does the heavy lifting of parsing the environment. (See `app.request_context` in `app.py` which uses `app.request_class`).
210:     *   Making this `request` object (and other context-specific things like `session`) easily accessible. (We'll cover contexts in detail in [Chapter 5](05_context_globals___current_app____request____session____g__.md) and [Chapter 7](07_application_and_request_contexts.md)).
211: 5.  **Routing:** Flask's routing system ([Chapter 2](02_routing_system.md)) uses `request.path` and `request.method` to find the correct view function via the `app.url_map`.
212: 6.  **View Function Call:** Flask calls your view function, possibly passing arguments extracted from the URL (like `username` in `/user/<username>`).
213: 7.  **Accessing Request Data:** Inside your view function, you access data using the `request` object (e.g., `request.args`, `request.form`).
214: 8.  **View Return Value:** Your view function returns a value (string, tuple, Response object).
215: 9.  **Response Creation:** Flask calls `app.make_response()` (see `app.py`) on the return value. This either uses the Response object you returned directly, or constructs a new one (`flask.wrappers.Response` or `app.response_class`) based on the string/tuple you returned. Werkzeug's `Response` handles formatting the body, status, and headers correctly.
216: 10. **Response Sent:** Flask returns the Response object's details (status, headers, body) back to the WSGI server.
217: 11. **Outgoing Response:** The server transmits the HTTP response back to the browser.
218: 12. **Context Teardown:** The Request Context is cleaned up.
219:

242:     RespObj-->>-FlaskApp: Response object created (status=200, body="...", headers={...})
243:     FlaskApp-->>-WSGIServer: Returns Response (via start_response, iterable body)
244:     WSGIServer-->>-Browser: Sends HTTP Response
245:     Note right of FlaskApp: Request Context is torn down
246: ```
247: 
248: The key takeaway is that Flask uses Werkzeug to wrap the raw incoming request data into a convenient `Request` object and helps you format your return value into a proper `Response` object to send back.
249: 
250: ## Conclusion
251: 
252: In this chapter, we explored the fundamental Request and Response objects in Flask.
253: 
254: *   The **`request` object** (imported from `flask`) gives you access to incoming data within your view functions, like URL parameters (`request.args`), form data (`request.form`), HTTP methods (`request.method`), and headers (`request.headers`). It's like opening the incoming mail.
255: *   Flask automatically converts the return value of your view functions into a **Response object**. You can return strings, tuples `(body, status)` or `(body, status, headers)`, or use `make_response` to create and customize a `Response` object directly (setting status codes, headers, cookies). This is like preparing your outgoing mail.
256: *   These objects are built upon Werkzeug's robust foundation.
257: 
258: Now you know how to receive data from the user and how to send back customized responses. But writing HTML directly inside Python strings (like in our form example) gets messy very quickly. How can we separate our presentation logic (HTML) from our application logic (Python)? That's where templating comes in!
259: 
260: Let's move on to [Chapter 4: Templating (Jinja2 Integration)](04_templating__jinja2_integration_.md) to see how Flask makes generating HTML much easier.

  8: # Chapter 4: Templating (Jinja2 Integration)
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 3: Request and Response Objects](03_request_and_response_objects.md), we saw how to handle incoming requests and craft outgoing responses. We even created a simple HTML form, but we had to write the HTML code directly as a string inside our Python function. Imagine building a whole website like that – it would get very messy very quickly!
 11: 
 12: How can we separate the design and structure of our web pages (HTML) from the Python code that generates the dynamic content? This chapter introduces **Templating**.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does It Solve? Mixing Code and Design is Messy
 15: 
 16: Think about writing a personalized email newsletter. You have a standard letter format (the design), but you need to insert specific details for each recipient (the dynamic data), like their name. You wouldn't want to write the entire letter from scratch in your code for every single person!
 17: 
 18: Similarly, when building a web page, you have the HTML structure (the design), but parts of it need to change based on data from your application (like showing the currently logged-in user's name, a list of products, or search results). Putting complex HTML directly into your Python view functions makes the code hard to read, hard to maintain, and difficult for web designers (who might not know Python) to work on.
 19: 
 20: We need a way to create HTML "templates" with special placeholders for the dynamic parts, and then have our Python code fill in those placeholders with actual data.
 21: 
 22: Flask uses a powerful template engine called **Jinja2** to solve this problem. Jinja2 lets you create HTML files (or other text files) that include variables and simple logic (like loops and conditions) directly within the template itself. Flask provides a convenient function, `render_template`, to take one of these template files, fill in the data, and give you back the final HTML ready to send to the user's browser.
 23: 
 24: It's exactly like **mail merge**:
 25: 
 26: *   **Template File (`.html`):** Your standard letter format.
 27: *   **Placeholders (`{{ variable }}`):** The spots where you'd put <<Name>> or <<Address>>.
 28: *   **Context Variables (Python dictionary):** The actual data (e.g., `name="Alice"`, `address="..."`).
 29: *   **`render_template` Function:** The mail merge tool itself.
 30: *   **Final HTML:** The personalized letter ready to be sent.
 31: 
 32: ## Creating Your First Template
 33: 
 34: By default, Flask looks for template files in a folder named `templates` right next to your main application file (like `hello.py`).
 35: 
 36: 1.  Create a folder named `templates` in the same directory as your `hello.py` file.
 37: 2.  Inside the `templates` folder, create a file named `hello.html`.
 38: 
 39: ```html
 40: <!-- templates/hello.html -->
 41: {% raw %}
 42: <!doctype html>
 43: <html>
 44:   <head>
 45:     <title>Hello Flask!</title>
 46:   </head>
 47:   <body>
 48:     <h1>Hello, {{ name_in_template }}!</h1>
 49:     <p>Welcome to our templated page.</p>
 50:   </body>
 51: </html>
 52: {% endraw %}
 53: ```
 54: 
 55: **Explanation:**
 56: 
 57: *   This is mostly standard HTML.
 58: *   `{{ name_in_template }}`: This is a Jinja2 **placeholder** or **expression**. It tells Jinja2: "When this template is rendered, replace this part with the value of the variable named `name_in_template` that the Python code provides."
 59: 
 60: ## Rendering Templates with `render_template`
 61: 
 62: Now, let's modify our Python code (`hello.py`) to use this template. We need to:
 63: 
 64: 1.  Import the `render_template` function from Flask.
 65: 2.  Call `render_template` in our view function, passing the name of the template file and any variables we want to make available in the template.
 66: 
 67: ```python
 68: # hello.py
 69: 
 70: # Make sure 'request' is imported if you use it elsewhere,
 71: # otherwise remove it for this example.
 72: from flask import Flask, render_template
 73: 
 74: app = Flask(__name__)
 75: 
 76: # Route for the homepage
 77: @app.route('/')
 78: def index():
 79:   # The name we want to display in the template
 80:   user_name = "World"
 81:   # Render the template, passing the user_name as a variable
 82:   # The key on the left ('name_in_template') is how we access it in HTML.
 83:   # The value on the right (user_name) is the Python variable.
 84:   return render_template('hello.html', name_in_template=user_name)
 85: 
 86: # NEW Route to greet a specific user using the same template
 87: @app.route('/user/<username>')
 88: def greet_user(username):
 89:   # Here, 'username' comes from the URL
 90:   # We still use 'name_in_template' as the key for the template
 91:   return render_template('hello.html', name_in_template=username)
 92: 
 93: # Code to run the app (from Chapter 1)
 94: if __name__ == '__main__':
 95:   app.run(debug=True)
 96: ```
 97: 
 98: **Explanation:**
 99: 
100: *   `from flask import render_template`: We import the necessary function.
101: *   `render_template('hello.html', ...)`: This tells Flask to find the `hello.html` file (it looks in the `templates` folder).
102: *   `name_in_template=user_name`: This is the crucial part where we pass data *into* the template. This creates a "context" dictionary like `{'name_in_template': 'World'}` (or `{'name_in_template': 'Alice'}` in the second route). Jinja2 uses this context to fill in the placeholders. The keyword argument name (`name_in_template`) **must match** the variable name used inside the `{{ }}` in the HTML file.
103: 
104: **Running this:**
105: 
106: 1.  Make sure you have the `templates` folder with `hello.html` inside it.
107: 2.  Save the updated `hello.py`.
108: 3.  Run `python hello.py` in your terminal.
109: 4.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Your browser will receive and display HTML generated from `hello.html`, showing: "Hello, World!".
110: 5.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/Alice`. Your browser will receive HTML generated from the *same* `hello.html` template, but this time showing: "Hello, Alice!".
111: 
112: See how we reused the same HTML structure but dynamically changed the content using `render_template` and variables!
113: 
114: ## Basic Jinja2 Syntax: Variables, Conditionals, and Loops
115: 
116: Jinja2 offers more than just variable substitution. You can use basic programming constructs right inside your HTML.
117: 
118: There are two main types of delimiters:
119: 
120: {% raw %}
121: *   `{{ ... }}`: Used for **expressions**. This is where you put variables you want to display, or even simple calculations or function calls. The result is inserted into the HTML.
122: *   `{% ... %}`: Used for **statements**. This includes things like `if`/`else` blocks, `for` loops, and other control structures. These don't directly output text but control how the template is rendered.
123: {% endraw %}
124: 
125: Let's look at some examples.
126: 
127: ### Example: Using `if`/`else`
128: 
129: Imagine you want to show different content depending on whether a user is logged in.
130: 
131: **Python (`hello.py`):**
132: 
133: ```python
134: # hello.py (add this route)
135: 
136: @app.route('/profile')
137: def profile():
138:   # Simulate a logged-in user for demonstration
139:   current_user = {'name': 'Charlie', 'is_logged_in': True}
140:   # Simulate no user logged in
141:   # current_user = None
142:   return render_template('profile.html', user=current_user)
143: 
144: # ... (keep other routes and run code)
145: ```
146: 
147: **Template (`templates/profile.html`):**
148: 
149: ```html
150: <!-- templates/profile.html -->
151: {% raw %}
152: <!doctype html>
153: <html>
154: <head><title>User Profile</title></head>
155: <body>
156:   {% if user and user.is_logged_in %}
157:     <h1>Welcome back, {{ user.name }}!</h1>
158:     <p>You are logged in.</p>
159:   {% else %}
160:     <h1>Welcome, Guest!</h1>
161:     <p>Please log in.</p>
162:   {% endif %}
163: </body>
164: </html>
165: {% endraw %}
166: ```
167: 
168: **Explanation:**
169: 
170: {% raw %}
171: *   `{% if user and user.is_logged_in %}`: Starts an `if` block. Jinja2 checks if the `user` variable exists and if its `is_logged_in` attribute is true.
172: *   `{% else %}`: If the `if` condition is false, the code under `else` is used.
173: *   `{% endif %}`: Marks the end of the `if` block.
174: *   `{{ user.name }}`: Accesses the `name` attribute of the `user` dictionary passed from Python.
175: {% endraw %}
176: 
177: If you run this and visit `/profile`, you'll see the "Welcome back, Charlie!" message. If you change `current_user` to `None` in the Python code and refresh, you'll see the "Welcome, Guest!" message.
178: 
179: ### Example: Using `for` Loops
180: 
181: Let's say you want to display a list of items.
182: 
183: **Python (`hello.py`):**
184: 
185: ```python
186: # hello.py (add this route)
187: 
188: @app.route('/items')
189: def show_items():
190:   item_list = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry']
191:   return render_template('items.html', items=item_list)
192: 
193: # ... (keep other routes and run code)
194: ```
195: 
196: **Template (`templates/items.html`):**
197: 
198: ```html
199: <!-- templates/items.html -->
200: {% raw %}
201: <!doctype html>
202: <html>
203: <head><title>Item List</title></head>
204: <body>
205:   <h2>Available Items:</h2>
206:   <ul>
207:     {% for fruit in items %}
208:       <li>{{ fruit }}</li>
209:     {% else %}
210:       <li>No items available.</li>
211:     {% endfor %}
212:   </ul>
213: </body>
214: </html>
215: {% endraw %}
216: ```
217: 
218: **Explanation:**
219: 
220: {% raw %}
221: *   `{% for fruit in items %}`: Starts a `for` loop. It iterates over the `items` list passed from Python. In each iteration, the current item is assigned to the variable `fruit`.
222: *   `<li>{{ fruit }}</li>`: Inside the loop, we display the current `fruit`.
223: *   `{% else %}`: This optional block is executed if the `items` list was empty.
224: *   `{% endfor %}`: Marks the end of the `for` loop.
225: {% endraw %}
226: 
227: Visiting `/items` will show a bulleted list of the fruits.
228: 
229: ## Generating URLs within Templates using `url_for`
230: 
231: Just like we used `url_for` in Python ([Chapter 2: Routing System](02_routing_system.md)) to avoid hardcoding URLs, we often need to generate URLs within our HTML templates (e.g., for links or form actions). Flask automatically makes the `url_for` function available inside your Jinja2 templates.
232: 
233: **Template (`templates/navigation.html`):**
234: 
235: ```html
236: <!-- templates/navigation.html -->
237: {% raw %}
238: <nav>
239:   <ul>
240:     <li><a href="{{ url_for('index') }}">Home</a></li>
241:     <li><a href="{{ url_for('show_items') }}">Items</a></li>
242:     <li><a href="{{ url_for('greet_user', username='Admin') }}">Admin Profile</a></li>
243:     <!-- Example link that might require login -->
244:     {% if user and user.is_logged_in %}
245:       <li><a href="{{ url_for('profile') }}">My Profile</a></li>
246:     {% else %}
247:       <li><a href="#">Login</a></li> {# Replace # with login URL later #}
248:     {% endif %}
249:   </ul>
250: </nav>
251: {% endraw %}
252: ```
253: 
254: **Explanation:**
255: 
256: {% raw %}
257: *   `{{ url_for('index') }}`: Generates the URL for the view function associated with the endpoint `'index'` (which is likely `/`).
258: *   `{{ url_for('show_items') }}`: Generates the URL for the `show_items` endpoint (likely `/items`).
259: *   `{{ url_for('greet_user', username='Admin') }}`: Generates the URL for the `greet_user` endpoint, filling in the `username` variable (likely `/user/Admin`).
260: {% endraw %}
261: 
262: Using `url_for` in templates ensures that your links will always point to the correct place, even if you change the URL rules in your Python code later.
263: 
264: ## Under the Hood: How `render_template` Works
265: 
266: When you call `render_template('some_template.html', var=value)`, here's a simplified sequence of what happens inside Flask and Jinja2:
267: 
268: {% raw %}
269: 1.  **Get Jinja Environment:** Flask accesses its configured Jinja2 environment (`current_app.jinja_env`). This environment holds the settings, filters, globals, and crucially, the **template loader**. (See `templating.py:render_template` which accesses `current_app.jinja_env`).
270: 2.  **Find Template:** The environment asks its loader (`app.jinja_env.loader`, which is typically a `DispatchingJinjaLoader` as created in `app.py:create_jinja_environment` and `templating.py:Environment`) to find the template file (`'some_template.html'`).
271: 3.  **Loader Search:** The `DispatchingJinjaLoader` knows where to look:
272:     *   It first checks the application's `template_folder` (usually `./templates`).
273:     *   If not found, it checks the `template_folder` of any registered Blueprints (more on those in [Chapter 8: Blueprints](08_blueprints.md)). (See `templating.py:DispatchingJinjaLoader._iter_loaders`).
274: 4.  **Load and Parse:** Once the loader finds the file, Jinja2 reads its content, parses it, and compiles it into an internal representation (a `Template` object) for efficient rendering. This might be cached. (Handled by `jinja_env.get_or_select_template`).
275: 5.  **Update Context:** Flask calls `app.update_template_context(context)` to add standard variables like `request`, `session`, `g`, and `config` to the dictionary of variables you passed (`{'var': value}`). This is done using "context processors" (more in [Chapter 5](05_context_globals___current_app____request____session____g__.md)). (See `templating.py:_render`).
276: 6.  **Signal:** Flask sends the `before_render_template` signal.
277: 7.  **Render:** The `Template` object's `render()` method is called with the combined context dictionary. Jinja2 processes the template, executing statements (`{% %}`) and substituting expressions (`{{ }}`) with values from the context.
278: 8.  **Return HTML:** The `render()` method returns the final, fully rendered HTML string.
279: 9.  **Signal:** Flask sends the `template_rendered` signal.
280: 10. **Send Response:** Flask takes this HTML string and builds an HTTP Response object to send back to the browser ([Chapter 3](03_request_and_response_objects.md)).
281: {% endraw %}

301:     ViewFunc->>+Response: Create Response from HTML string
302:     Response-->>-ViewFunc: Response object
303:     ViewFunc-->>Browser: Return Response
304: ```
305: 
306: The key players are the `Flask` application instance (which holds the Jinja2 environment configuration), the `render_template` function, and the Jinja2 `Environment` itself, which uses loaders to find templates and context processors to enrich the data available during rendering.
307: 
308: ## Conclusion
309: 
310: Templating is a fundamental technique for building dynamic web pages. Flask integrates seamlessly with the powerful Jinja2 template engine.
311: 
312: {% raw %}
313: *   We learned that templating separates HTML structure from Python logic.
314: *   Flask looks for templates in a `templates` folder by default.
315: *   The `render_template()` function is used to load a template file and pass data (context variables) to it.
316: *   Jinja2 templates use `{{ variable }}` to display data and `{% statement %}` for control flow (like `if` and `for`).
317: *   The `url_for()` function is available in templates for generating URLs dynamically.
318: {% endraw %}
319: 
320: Now you can create clean, maintainable HTML pages driven by your Flask application's data and logic.
321: 
322: But how do functions like `url_for`, and variables like `request` and `session`, magically become available inside templates without us explicitly passing them every time? This happens through Flask's context system and context processors. Let's explore these "magic" variables in the next chapter.
323: 
324: Ready to uncover the context? Let's move on to [Chapter 5: Context Globals (`current_app`, `request`, `session`, `g`)](05_context_globals___current_app____request____session____g__.md).

  8: # Chapter 5: Context Globals (`current_app`, `request`, `session`, `g`)
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 4: Templating (Jinja2 Integration)](04_templating__jinja2_integration_.md), we learned how to separate our HTML structure from our Python code using templates and the `render_template` function. We saw how variables like `request` and functions like `url_for` seemed to be magically available in our templates.
 11: 
 12: But how does that work? And more importantly, how can we easily access important information like the current application instance or the details of the incoming web request *inside* our Python view functions without passing these objects around manually to every single function? Imagine having to add `app` and `request` as arguments to all your helper functions – it would be very repetitive!
 13: 
 14: This chapter introduces Flask's solution: **Context Globals**.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Do They Solve? Avoiding Tedious Parameter Passing
 17: 
 18: Think about working on a team project. There are certain tools or pieces of information everyone on the team needs access to frequently: the project plan, the shared calendar, the main contact person. It would be inefficient if every time someone needed the project plan, they had to specifically ask someone else to pass it to them. Instead, you might have a central place or a well-known name (like "The Plan") that everyone knows how to find.
 19: 
 20: Similarly, in a Flask application, several objects are very commonly needed while handling a web request:
 21: 
 22: *   The application instance itself (to access configuration, loggers, etc.).
 23: *   The incoming request object (to get form data, query parameters, headers, etc.).
 24: *   A way to store temporary information related to the current user across multiple requests (the session).
 25: *   A temporary storage space just for the *current* request.
 26: 
 27: Passing these objects explicitly as parameters to every function that might need them (especially view functions, `before_request` functions, `after_request` functions, template context processors) would make our code cluttered and harder to manage.
 28: 
 29: Flask provides special "global" variables – **`current_app`**, **`request`**, **`session`**, and **`g`** – that act like smart pointers. They automatically find and give you access to the *correct* object relevant to the specific request you are currently handling, without you needing to pass anything around. They feel like magic variables!
 30: 
 31: ## Meet the Context Globals
 32: 
 33: These special variables are technically called **proxies**. Think of a proxy as a stand-in or an agent. When you talk to the `request` proxy, it secretly finds the *actual* request object for the HTTP request that is currently being processed and acts on its behalf. This magic happens using Flask's "context" system, which we'll touch on later and explore more in [Chapter 7](07_application_and_request_contexts.md).
 34: 
 35: Let's meet the main context globals:
 36: 
 37: 1.  **`request`**: Represents the incoming HTTP request from the client (browser). It contains all the data the client sent, like form data, URL parameters, HTTP headers, the requested URL, etc. We already used this in [Chapter 3: Request and Response Objects](03_request_and_response_objects.md).
 38: 2.  **`session`**: A dictionary-like object that lets you store information specific to a user *across multiple requests*. It's commonly used for things like remembering if a user is logged in, or storing items in a shopping cart. Flask typically uses secure cookies to handle this.
 39: 3.  **`current_app`**: Represents the *instance* of your Flask application that is handling the current request. This is useful for accessing application-wide configurations, resources, or extensions. It points to the same object you created with `app = Flask(__name__)` in [Chapter 1](01_application_object___flask__.md), but you can access it from anywhere *during* a request without needing the `app` variable directly.
 40: 4.  **`g`**: A simple namespace object (think of it like an empty box or scratchpad) that is available only for the duration of the *current request*. You can use it to store temporary data that multiple functions within the same request cycle might need access to, without passing it around. For example, you might store the current logged-in user object or a database connection here. It gets reset for every new request. The 'g' stands for "global", but it's global *only within the request context*.
 41: 
 42: ## Using the Context Globals
 43: 
 44: First, you usually need to import them from the `flask` package:
 45: 
 46: ```python
 47: from flask import Flask, request, session, current_app, g, render_template
 48: import os # For generating a secret key
 49: 
 50: # Create the application object
 51: app = Flask(__name__)
 52: 
 53: # !! IMPORTANT !! Sessions require a secret key for security.
 54: # In a real app, set this from an environment variable or config file!
 55: # Never hardcode it like this in production.
 56: app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.urandom(24)
 57: # We'll learn more about config in Chapter 6: Configuration (Config)
 58: ```
 59: 
 60: Now let's see how to use them.
 61: 
 62: ### `request`: Accessing Incoming Data
 63: 
 64: We saw this in Chapter 3. Notice how the `index` function can use `request` directly without it being passed as an argument.
 65: 
 66: ```python
 67: # hello.py (continued)
 68: 
 69: @app.route('/')
 70: def index():
 71:   user_agent = request.headers.get('User-Agent', 'Unknown')
 72:   method = request.method
 73:   return f'Welcome! Method: {method}, Browser: {user_agent}'
 74: ```
 75: 
 76: **Explanation:**
 77: 
 78: *   `request.headers.get(...)`: Accesses the HTTP headers from the incoming request.
 79: *   `request.method`: Gets the HTTP method used (e.g., 'GET', 'POST').
 80: 
 81: Flask automatically makes the correct `request` object available here when the `/` route is visited.
 82: 
 83: ### `current_app`: Accessing Application Settings
 84: 
 85: Imagine you want to log something using the application's logger or access a configuration value.
 86: 
 87: ```python
 88: # hello.py (continued)
 89: 
 90: # Add another config value for demonstration
 91: app.config['MY_SETTING'] = 'Flask is Cool'
 92: 
 93: @app.route('/app-info')
 94: def app_info():
 95:   # Access the application's logger
 96:   current_app.logger.info('Someone accessed the app-info page.')
 97: 
 98:   # Access a configuration value
 99:   setting = current_app.config.get('MY_SETTING', 'Default Value')
100:   debug_mode = current_app.config['DEBUG'] # Accessing debug status
101: 
102:   return f'My Setting: {setting}<br>Debug Mode: {debug_mode}'
103: 
104: # Make sure debug is enabled for the logger example to show easily
105: # if __name__ == '__main__':
106: #   app.run(debug=True)
107: ```
108: 
109: **Explanation:**
110: 
111: *   `current_app.logger.info(...)`: Uses the logger configured on the `app` object.
112: *   `current_app.config.get(...)`: Accesses the application's configuration dictionary.
113: 
114: Again, `app_info` doesn't need `app` passed in; `current_app` provides access to it within the request context.
115: 
116: ### `session`: Remembering Things Across Requests
117: 
118: Sessions allow you to store data associated with a specific user's browser session. Flask uses a secret key (`app.secret_key` or `app.config['SECRET_KEY']`) to cryptographically sign the session cookie, preventing users from modifying it. **Always set a strong, random secret key!**
119: 
120: Let's create a simple view counter that increments each time the *same* user visits the page.
121: 
122: ```python
123: # hello.py (continued)
124: 
125: @app.route('/counter')
126: def counter():
127:   # Get the current count from the session, default to 0 if not found
128:   count = session.get('view_count', 0)
129: 
130:   # Increment the count
131:   count += 1
132: 
133:   # Store the new count back in the session
134:   session['view_count'] = count
135: 
136:   # Log the session content (for demonstration)
137:   current_app.logger.info(f"Session data: {session}")
138: 
139:   return f'You have visited this page {count} times during this session.'
140: ```
141: 
142: **Explanation:**
143: 
144: *   `session.get('view_count', 0)`: Reads the `view_count` value from the session. If it's the first visit, it doesn't exist yet, so we default to `0`.
145: *   `session['view_count'] = count`: Stores the updated count back into the session.
146: *   Flask handles sending the updated session data back to the browser in a secure cookie behind the scenes.
147: 
148: **Running this:**
149: 
150: 1.  Make sure `app.config['SECRET_KEY']` is set in your `hello.py`.
151: 2.  Run `python hello.py`.
152: 3.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/counter`. You'll see "You have visited this page 1 times...".
153: 4.  Refresh the page. You'll see "You have visited this page 2 times...".
154: 5.  Refresh again. It will become 3, and so on.
155: 6.  If you close your browser completely and reopen it (or use a private/incognito window), the count will reset to 1 because the session cookie is typically cleared or different.
156: 
157: ### `g`: Temporary Storage for a Single Request
158: 
159: The `g` object is useful for storing data that needs to be accessed by multiple functions *within the same request cycle*. A common example is loading the current user's information from a database or verifying an API key. You might do this in a `@app.before_request` function and then access the result in your view function using `g`.
160: 
161: Let's simulate loading some data before the request and accessing it in the view.
162: 
163: ```python
164: # hello.py (continued)
165: import time
166: 
167: # This function runs BEFORE every request
168: @app.before_request
169: def load_request_data():
170:   # Imagine loading data from a database or external source here
171:   g.request_time = time.time()
172:   g.user = 'Guest' # Default user
173:   # Maybe check for an API key or user session here and set g.user accordingly
174:   # For example: if session.get('logged_in_user'): g.user = session['logged_in_user']
175:   current_app.logger.info(f"Before request: Set g.user to {g.user}")
176: 
177: @app.route('/show-g')
178: def show_g():
179:   # Access the data stored in 'g' by the before_request handler
180:   req_time = g.get('request_time', 'Not Set')
181:   current_user = g.get('user', 'Unknown')
182: 
183:   # Check if it's still there after the request (it shouldn't be for the *next* request)
184:   # We can't easily show this here, but g is cleared between requests.
185: 
186:   return f'Data from g:<br>Request Time: {req_time}<br>User: {current_user}'
187: 
188: # This function runs AFTER every request, even if errors occur
189: # It receives the response object
190: @app.teardown_request
191: def teardown_request_data(exception=None):
192:     # This is a good place to clean up resources stored in g, like DB connections
193:     req_time = g.pop('request_time', None) # Safely remove request_time
194:     user = g.pop('user', None) # Safely remove user
195:     if req_time:
196:       duration = time.time() - req_time
197:       current_app.logger.info(f"Teardown request: User={user}, Duration={duration:.4f}s")
198:     else:
199:       current_app.logger.info("Teardown request: g values already popped or not set.")
200: 
201: # ... (rest of the app, including if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug=True))
202: ```
203: 
204: **Explanation:**
205: 
206: *   `@app.before_request`: This decorator registers `load_request_data` to run before each request is processed.
207: *   `g.request_time = ...` and `g.user = ...`: We store arbitrary data on the `g` object. It acts like a Python object where you can set attributes.
208: *   `g.get('request_time', ...)`: In the view function `show_g`, we retrieve the data stored on `g`. Using `.get()` is safer as it allows providing a default if the attribute wasn't set.
209: *   `@app.teardown_request`: This decorator registers `teardown_request_data` to run after the request has been handled and the response sent, even if an exception occurred. It's a good place to clean up resources stored in `g`. `g.pop()` is used to get the value and remove it, preventing potential issues if the teardown runs multiple times in complex scenarios.
210: 
211: When you visit `/show-g`, the `before_request` function runs first, setting `g.user` and `g.request_time`. Then `show_g` runs and reads those values from `g`. Finally, `teardown_request` runs. If you make another request, `g` will be empty again until `before_request` runs for that *new* request.
212: 
213: ## Why "Context"? The Magic Behind the Scenes
214: 
215: How do these globals always know which `request` or `app` to point to, especially if your web server is handling multiple requests at the same time?
216: 
217: Flask manages this using **Contexts**. There are two main types:
218: 
219: 1.  **Application Context:** Holds information about the application itself. When an application context is active, `current_app` and `g` point to the correct application instance and its request-global storage (`g`). An application context is automatically created when a request context is pushed, or you can create one manually using `with app.app_context():`. This is needed for tasks that aren't tied to a specific request but need the application, like running background jobs or initializing database tables via a script.
220: 2.  **Request Context:** Holds information about a single, specific HTTP request. When a request context is active, `request` and `session` point to the correct request object and session data for *that specific request*. Flask automatically creates and activates (pushes) a request context when it receives an incoming HTTP request and removes (pops) it when the request is finished.
221: 
222: Think of these contexts like temporary bubbles or environments. When Flask handles a request, it inflates a request context bubble (which automatically includes an application context bubble inside it). Inside this bubble, the names `request`, `session`, `current_app`, and `g` are set up to point to the objects belonging to *that specific bubble*. If another request comes in concurrently (in a different thread or process), Flask creates a *separate* bubble for it, and the context globals inside that second bubble point to *its* own request, session, app, and g objects.
223: 
224: This system ensures that even with multiple simultaneous requests, `request` in the code handling request A always refers to request A's data, while `request` in the code handling request B always refers to request B's data.
225: 
226: We will explore contexts in more detail in [Chapter 7: Application and Request Contexts](07_application_and_request_contexts.md).
227: 
228: ## Under the Hood: Proxies and `contextvars`
229: 
230: How do these variables like `request` actually *do* the lookup within the current context?
231: 
232: Flask uses a concept called **Local Proxies**, specifically `werkzeug.local.LocalProxy`. These proxy objects are essentially clever stand-ins. When you access an attribute or method on a proxy (like `request.method`), the proxy doesn't have the method itself. Instead, it performs a lookup to find the *real* object it should be representing *at that moment* based on the current context.
233: 
234: Under the hood, Flask (since version 1.1, leveraging Werkzeug updates) uses Python's built-in `contextvars` module (or a backport for older Python versions). `contextvars` provides special kinds of variables (`ContextVar`) that can hold different values depending on the current execution context (like the specific request/thread/async task being handled).
235: 
236: 1.  Flask defines context variables, for example, `_cv_request` in `flask.globals`.
237: 2.  When a request context is pushed (`RequestContext.push()` in `ctx.py`), Flask stores the actual `Request` object for the current request into `_cv_request` *for the current context*.
238: 3.  The `request` global variable (defined in `flask.globals`) is a `LocalProxy` that is configured to look up the object stored in `_cv_request`.
239: 4.  When your code uses `request.method`, the proxy sees it needs the real request object, looks at the current context's value for `_cv_request`, gets the real `Request` object stored there, and then calls the `.method` attribute on *that* object.
240: 
241: A similar process happens for `current_app`, `session`, and `g` using `_cv_app`.
242: 
243: Here's how `request` and `session` are defined in `flask/globals.py`:
244: 
245: ```python
246: # flask/globals.py (simplified)
247: from contextvars import ContextVar
248: from werkzeug.local import LocalProxy
249: # ... other imports
250: 
251: # Context Variables hold the actual context objects
252: _cv_app: ContextVar[AppContext] = ContextVar("flask.app_ctx")
253: _cv_request: ContextVar[RequestContext] = ContextVar("flask.request_ctx")
254: 
255: # Proxies point to objects within the currently active context
256: # The LocalProxy is told how to find the real object (e.g., via _cv_request)
257: # and which attribute on that context object to return (e.g., 'request')
258: request: Request = LocalProxy(_cv_request, "request") # type: ignore
259: session: SessionMixin = LocalProxy(_cv_request, "session") # type: ignore
260: current_app: Flask = LocalProxy(_cv_app, "app") # type: ignore
261: g: _AppCtxGlobals = LocalProxy(_cv_app, "g") # type: ignore
262: ```
263: 
264: This proxy mechanism allows you to write clean code using simple global names, while Flask handles the complexity of ensuring those names point to the correct, context-specific objects behind the scenes.
265: 
266: Here's a diagram showing two concurrent requests and how the `request` proxy resolves differently in each context:
267: 
268: ```mermaid
269: sequenceDiagram
270:     participant UserCodeA as View Func (Req A)
271:     participant Proxy as request (LocalProxy)
272:     participant ContextVars as Context Storage

274: 
275:     Note over UserCodeA, UserCodeB: Requests A and B handled concurrently
276: 
277:     UserCodeA->>+Proxy: Access request.method

281:     RequestContextA-->>Proxy: Return Real Request A

283:     RealRequestA-->>Proxy: Return 'GET'
284:     Proxy-->>-UserCodeA: Return 'GET'
285: 
286:     UserCodeB->>+Proxy: Access request.form['name']
287:     Proxy->>+ContextVars: Get current value of _cv_request
288:     ContextVars-->>-Proxy: Return RequestContext B
289:     Proxy->>RequestContextB: Get 'request' attribute (Real Request B)
290:     RequestContextB-->>Proxy: Return Real Request B
291:     Proxy->>RealRequestB: Access 'form' attribute
292:     RealRequestB-->>Proxy: Return FormDict B
293:     Proxy->>FormDictB: Get item 'name'
294:     FormDictB-->>Proxy: Return 'Bob'
295:     Proxy-->>-UserCodeB: Return 'Bob'
296: 
297: ```
298: 
299: ## Conclusion
300: 
301: You've learned about Flask's Context Globals: `current_app`, `request`, `session`, and `g`. These are powerful proxy objects that simplify your code by providing easy access to application- or request-specific information without needing to pass objects around manually.
302: 
303: *   **`request`**: Accesses incoming request data.
304: *   **`session`**: Stores user-specific data across requests (requires `SECRET_KEY`).
305: *   **`current_app`**: Accesses the active application instance and its config/resources.
306: *   **`g`**: A temporary storage space for the duration of a single request.
307: 
308: These globals work their magic through Flask's **context** system (Application Context and Request Context) and **proxies** that look up the correct object in the currently active context, often powered by Python's `contextvars`.
309: 
310: Understanding these globals is key to writing idiomatic Flask code. You'll frequently use `request` to handle user input, `session` for user state, `current_app` for configuration, and `g` for managing request-scoped resources like database connections.
311: 
312: Speaking of configuration, how exactly do we set things like the `SECRET_KEY`, database URLs, or other settings for our application? That's the topic of our next chapter.
313: 
314: Let's learn how to manage settings effectively in [Chapter 6: Configuration (`Config`)](06_configuration___config__.md).

  8: # Chapter 6: Configuration (`Config`)
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 5: Context Globals (`current_app`, `request`, `session`, `g`)](05_context_globals___current_app____request____session____g__.md), we saw how Flask uses context globals like `current_app` and `session`. We even learned that using the `session` requires setting a `SECRET_KEY` on our application object. But where is the best place to put settings like the secret key, or maybe a database connection string, or a flag to turn debugging features on or off? We definitely don't want to hardcode these directly into our main application logic!
 11: 
 12: This chapter introduces Flask's built-in solution: the **Configuration** system.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does It Solve? The Need for a Settings Panel
 15: 
 16: Imagine building a piece of electronic equipment, like a stereo amplifier. It has various knobs and switches: volume, bass, treble, input source selectors. These controls allow you to adjust the amplifier's behavior without opening it up and rewiring things.
 17: 
 18: A web application also needs settings to control its behavior:
 19: 
 20: *   **Security:** A `SECRET_KEY` is needed for secure sessions.
 21: *   **Debugging:** Should detailed error messages be shown (useful for development, dangerous for production)?
 22: *   **Database:** Where is the database located? What are the login credentials?
 23: *   **External Services:** What are the API keys for services like email sending or payment processing?
 24: 
 25: Hardcoding these values directly in your view functions or application setup code is messy and inflexible. If you need to change the database location when deploying your app from your laptop to a real server, you'd have to find and change the code. This is prone to errors and makes managing different environments (development, testing, production) difficult.
 26: 
 27: Flask provides a central object, usually accessed via `app.config`, that acts like your application's main **settings panel**. It's a dictionary-like object where you can store all your configuration values. Flask itself uses this object for its own settings (like `DEBUG` or `SECRET_KEY`), and you can add your own custom settings too. Crucially, Flask provides convenient ways to load these settings from different places, like files or environment variables, keeping your configuration separate from your code.
 28: 
 29: Our primary use case right now is setting the `SECRET_KEY` properly so we can use the `session` object securely, as discussed in [Chapter 5](05_context_globals___current_app____request____session____g__.md).
 30: 
 31: ## Meet `app.config`
 32: 
 33: When you create a Flask application object (`app = Flask(__name__)`), Flask automatically creates a configuration object for you, accessible as `app.config`.
 34: 
 35: *   It works like a standard Python dictionary: you can store values using keys (e.g., `app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = '...'`) and retrieve them (e.g., `key = app.config['SECRET_KEY']`).
 36: *   Keys are typically uppercase strings (e.g., `DEBUG`, `DATABASE_URI`). Flask's built-in settings follow this convention, and it's recommended for your own settings too.
 37: *   It comes pre-populated with some default values.
 38: *   It has special methods to load configuration from various sources.
 39: 
 40: ## Populating the Configuration
 41: 
 42: There are several ways to add settings to `app.config`. Let's explore the most common ones.
 43: 
 44: ### 1. Directly from Code (In-Place)
 45: 
 46: You can set configuration values directly like you would with a dictionary. This is often done right after creating the `app` object.
 47: 
 48: ```python
 49: # hello.py (or your main app file)
 50: from flask import Flask
 51: import os
 52: 
 53: app = Flask(__name__)
 54: 
 55: # Setting configuration directly
 56: app.config['DEBUG'] = True # Turn on debug mode
 57: app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.urandom(24) # Generate a random key (OK for simple dev)
 58: app.config['MY_CUSTOM_SETTING'] = 'Hello Config!'
 59: 
 60: print(f"Debug mode is: {app.config['DEBUG']}")
 61: print(f"My custom setting: {app.config.get('MY_CUSTOM_SETTING')}")
 62: # Using .get() is safer if the key might not exist
 63: print(f"Another setting: {app.config.get('NON_EXISTENT_KEY', 'Default Value')}")
 64: 
 65: # ... rest of your app (routes, etc.) ...
 66: 
 67: # Example route accessing config
 68: @app.route('/config-example')
 69: def config_example():
 70:   custom_val = app.config.get('MY_CUSTOM_SETTING', 'Not set')
 71:   return f'The custom setting is: {custom_val}'
 72: 
 73: if __name__ == '__main__':
 74:   # The app.run(debug=True) argument also sets app.config['DEBUG'] = True
 75:   # but setting it explicitly ensures it's set even if run differently.
 76:   app.run()
 77: ```
 78: 
 79: **Explanation:**
 80: 
 81: *   We directly assign values to keys in `app.config`.
 82: *   `os.urandom(24)` generates a random byte string suitable for a secret key during development. **Never hardcode a predictable secret key, especially in production!**
 83: *   We can access values using `[]` or the safer `.get()` method which allows providing a default.
 84: 
 85: **When to use:** Good for setting Flask's built-in defaults (like `DEBUG`) temporarily during development or setting simple, non-sensitive values. **Not ideal for secrets or complex configurations**, especially for deployment, as it mixes configuration with code.
 86: 
 87: ### 2. From a Python Object (`from_object`)
 88: 
 89: You can define your configuration in a separate Python object (like a class) or a dedicated module (`.py` file) and then load it using `app.config.from_object()`. This method only loads attributes whose names are **all uppercase**.
 90: 
 91: First, create a configuration file, say `config.py`:
 92: 
 93: ```python
 94: # config.py
 95: # Note: Only uppercase variables will be loaded by from_object
 96: 
 97: DEBUG = True # Set debug mode
 98: SECRET_KEY = 'a-very-secret-and-complex-key-loaded-from-object' # KEEP SECRET IN REAL APPS
 99: DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///mydatabase.db'
100: 
101: # This lowercase variable will NOT be loaded into app.config
102: internal_value = 'ignore me'
103: ```
104: 
105: Now, load it in your main application file:
106: 
107: ```python
108: # hello.py
109: from flask import Flask
110: 
111: app = Flask(__name__)
112: 
113: # Load configuration from the config.py file (using its import path as a string)
114: app.config.from_object('config')
115: # Alternatively, if you imported the module:
116: # import config
117: # app.config.from_object(config)
118: 
119: print(f"Loaded Debug: {app.config.get('DEBUG')}")
120: print(f"Loaded Secret Key: {app.config.get('SECRET_KEY')}")
121: print(f"Loaded DB URI: {app.config.get('DATABASE_URI')}")
122: print(f"Internal Value (should be None): {app.config.get('internal_value')}")
123: 
124: # ... rest of your app ...
125: if __name__ == '__main__':
126:   app.run()
127: ```
128: 
129: **Explanation:**
130: 
131: *   `app.config.from_object('config')` tells Flask to import the module named `config` (which corresponds to `config.py`) and look for any uppercase attributes (`DEBUG`, `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URI`).
132: *   It copies the values of these uppercase attributes into the `app.config` dictionary.
133: *   `internal_value` is ignored because it's lowercase.
134: 
135: **When to use:** Great for organizing your default configuration or different configurations (e.g., `DevelopmentConfig`, `ProductionConfig` classes) within your project structure. Helps keep settings separate from application logic.
136: 
137: ### 3. From a Python File (`from_pyfile`)
138: 
139: Similar to `from_object`, but instead of importing a module, `app.config.from_pyfile()` executes a Python file (it doesn't have to end in `.py`, often `.cfg` is used by convention) and loads its uppercase variables.
140: 
141: Create a configuration file, say `settings.cfg`:
142: 
143: ```python
144: # settings.cfg
145: # This file will be executed by Python
146: 
147: SECRET_KEY = 'secret-key-loaded-from-pyfile'
148: SERVER_NAME = '127.0.0.1:5000' # Example setting
149: 
150: # You can even have simple logic if needed
151: import os
152: APP_ROOT = os.path.dirname(__file__)
153: ```
154: 
155: Load it in your application:
156: 
157: ```python
158: # hello.py
159: from flask import Flask
160: import os
161: 
162: app = Flask(__name__)
163: 
164: # Construct the path to the config file relative to this file
165: # __file__ is the path to the current python script (hello.py)
166: # os.path.dirname gets the directory containing hello.py
167: # os.path.join creates the full path to settings.cfg
168: config_file_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'settings.cfg')
169: 
170: # Load configuration from the file
171: # Set silent=True to ignore errors if the file doesn't exist
172: loaded = app.config.from_pyfile(config_file_path, silent=False)
173: 
174: if loaded:
175:     print("Loaded config from settings.cfg")
176:     print(f"Loaded Secret Key: {app.config.get('SECRET_KEY')}")
177:     print(f"Loaded Server Name: {app.config.get('SERVER_NAME')}")
178:     print(f"Calculated APP_ROOT: {app.config.get('APP_ROOT')}")
179: else:
180:     print("Could not load settings.cfg")
181: 
182: # ... rest of your app ...
183: if __name__ == '__main__':
184:   app.run()
185: ```
186: 
187: **Explanation:**
188: 
189: *   `app.config.from_pyfile('settings.cfg')` reads the specified file, executes it as Python code, and loads the uppercase variables into `app.config`.
190: *   This allows configuration files to be simple variable assignments but also include basic Python logic if needed.
191: *   The `silent=True` argument is useful if the config file is optional.
192: 
193: **When to use:** Very flexible. Good for separating configuration completely from your application package. Often used for instance-specific configurations (settings for a particular deployment).
194: 
195: ### 4. From Environment Variables (`from_envvar`)
196: 
197: This is a common pattern, especially for production deployment. Instead of hardcoding the *path* to a configuration file, you store the path in an environment variable. `app.config.from_envvar()` reads the filename from the specified environment variable and then loads that file using `from_pyfile`.
198: 
199: Imagine you have your `settings.cfg` from the previous example.
200: 
201: Before running your app, you set an environment variable in your terminal:
202: 
203: *   **Linux/macOS:** `export YOURAPP_SETTINGS=/path/to/your/settings.cfg`
204: *   **Windows (cmd):** `set YOURAPP_SETTINGS=C:\path\to\your\settings.cfg`
205: *   **Windows (PowerShell):** `$env:YOURAPP_SETTINGS="C:\path\to\your\settings.cfg"`
206: 
207: Then, in your code:
208: 
209: ```python
210: # hello.py
211: from flask import Flask
212: 
213: app = Flask(__name__)
214: 
215: # Load configuration from the file specified by the YOURAPP_SETTINGS env var
216: # Set silent=True to allow the app to run even if the env var isn't set
217: loaded = app.config.from_envvar('YOURAPP_SETTINGS', silent=True)
218: 
219: if loaded:
220:     print(f"Loaded config from file specified in YOURAPP_SETTINGS: {app.config.get('SECRET_KEY')}")
221: else:
222:     print("YOURAPP_SETTINGS environment variable not set or file not found.")
223:     # You might want to set default configs here or raise an error
224: 
225: # ... rest of your app ...
226: if __name__ == '__main__':
227:   app.run()
228: 
229: ```
230: 
231: **Explanation:**
232: 
233: *   `app.config.from_envvar('YOURAPP_SETTINGS')` looks for the environment variable `YOURAPP_SETTINGS`.
234: *   If found, it takes the value (which should be a file path, e.g., `/path/to/your/settings.cfg`) and loads that file using `from_pyfile()`.
235: *   This decouples the *location* of the config file from your application code.
236: 
237: **When to use:** Excellent for production and deployment. Allows operators to specify the configuration file location without modifying the application code. Essential for managing different environments (development, staging, production) where configuration files might reside in different places or contain different values (especially secrets).
238: 
239: ### Loading Order and Overrides
240: 
241: You can use multiple loading methods. Each subsequent method will **override** any values set by previous methods if the keys are the same.
242: 
243: A common pattern is:
244: 
245: 1.  Set default values directly in `app.config` or load from a default `config.py` using `from_object`.
246: 2.  Load settings from an instance-specific file (e.g., `settings.cfg`) using `from_pyfile` or `from_envvar`. This allows deployment-specific settings (like database URLs or secret keys) to override the defaults.
247: 
248: ```python
249: # hello.py
250: from flask import Flask
251: import os
252: 
253: app = Flask(__name__)
254: 
255: # 1. Set built-in defaults maybe? Or load from a base config object.
256: app.config['DEBUG'] = False # Default to False for safety
257: app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'default-insecure-key' # Default bad key
258: 
259: # You could load more defaults from an object here:
260: # app.config.from_object('yourapp.default_config')
261: 
262: # 2. Try to load from an environment variable pointing to a deployment-specific file
263: config_file_path = os.environ.get('YOURAPP_SETTINGS')
264: if config_file_path:
265:     try:
266:         app.config.from_pyfile(config_file_path)
267:         print(f"Loaded overrides from {config_file_path}")
268:     except OSError as e:
269:         print(f"Warning: Could not load config file {config_file_path}: {e}")
270: else:
271:     print("Info: YOURAPP_SETTINGS environment variable not set, using defaults.")
272: 
273: 
274: print(f"Final Debug value: {app.config['DEBUG']}")
275: print(f"Final Secret Key: {app.config['SECRET_KEY']}")
276: 
277: # ... rest of your app ...
278: if __name__ == '__main__':
279:   app.run()
280: ```
281: 
282: Now, if `YOURAPP_SETTINGS` points to a file containing `DEBUG = True` and a different `SECRET_KEY`, those values will override the defaults set earlier.
283: 
284: ## Accessing Configuration Values
285: 
286: Once loaded, you can access configuration values anywhere you have access to the application object (`app`) or the `current_app` proxy (within a request or application context, see [Chapter 5](05_context_globals___current_app____request____session____g__.md)).
287: 
288: ```python
289: from flask import current_app, session
290: 
291: # Inside a view function or other request-context code:
292: @app.route('/some-route')
293: def some_view():
294:     # Using current_app proxy
295:     api_key = current_app.config.get('MY_API_KEY')
296:     if not api_key:
297:         return "Error: API Key not configured!", 500
298: 
299:     # Flask extensions often use app.config too
300:     session['user_id'] = 123 # Uses current_app.config['SECRET_KEY'] implicitly
301:     
302:     # ... use api_key ...
303:     return f"Using API Key starting with: {api_key[:5]}..."
304: 
305: # Accessing outside a request context (e.g., in setup code)

307: with app.app_context():
308:     print(f"Accessing SECRET_KEY via current_app: {current_app.config['SECRET_KEY']}")
309: 
310: # Or directly via the app object if available
311: print(f"Accessing SECRET_KEY via app: {app.config['SECRET_KEY']}")
312: ```
313: 
314: ## Under the Hood: The `Config` Object
315: 
316: What's happening when you call these methods?
317: 
318: 1.  **`app.config` Object:** When you create `Flask(__name__)`, the `Flask` constructor creates an instance of `app.config_class` (which defaults to `flask.Config`) and assigns it to `app.config`. The constructor passes the application's `root_path` and the `default_config` dictionary. (See `Flask.__init__` in `app.py` calling `self.make_config`, which uses `self.config_class` defined in `sansio/app.py`).
319: 2.  **`Config` Class:** The `flask.Config` class (in `config.py`) inherits directly from Python's built-in `dict`. This is why you can use standard dictionary methods like `[]`, `.get()`, `.update()`, etc.
320: 3.  **Loading Methods:**
321:     *   `from_object(obj)`: If `obj` is a string, it imports it using `werkzeug.utils.import_string`. Then, it iterates through the attributes of the object (`dir(obj)`) and copies any attribute whose name is entirely uppercase into the config dictionary (`self[key] = getattr(obj, key)`).
322:     *   `from_pyfile(filename)`: It constructs the full path to the file using `os.path.join(self.root_path, filename)`. It creates a temporary module object (`types.ModuleType`). It opens and reads the file, compiles the content (`compile()`), and then executes it within the temporary module's dictionary (`exec(..., d.__dict__)`). Finally, it calls `self.from_object()` on the temporary module object to load the uppercase variables.
323:     *   `from_envvar(variable_name)`: It simply reads the environment variable (`os.environ.get(variable_name)`). If the variable exists and is not empty, it calls `self.from_pyfile()` using the value of the environment variable as the filename.
324: 
325: Here's a simplified diagram for `from_pyfile`:
326: 
327: ```mermaid
328: sequenceDiagram
329:     participant UserCode as Your App Code
330:     participant AppConfig as app.config (Config obj)
331:     participant OS as File System
332:     participant PythonExec as Python Interpreter
333: 
334:     UserCode->>+AppConfig: app.config.from_pyfile('settings.cfg')
335:     AppConfig->>+OS: Find file 'settings.cfg' relative to root_path
336:     OS-->>-AppConfig: Return file handle
337:     AppConfig->>+PythonExec: Compile and Execute file content in a temporary module scope
338:     PythonExec-->>-AppConfig: Execution complete (vars defined in temp scope)
339:     AppConfig->>AppConfig: Iterate temp scope, copy UPPERCASE vars to self (dict)
340:     AppConfig-->>-UserCode: Return True (if successful)
341: ```
342: 
343: The key takeaway is that `app.config` is fundamentally a Python dictionary enhanced with convenient methods for populating itself from common configuration sources like Python objects, files, and environment variables, filtering for uppercase keys.
344: 
345: ## Conclusion
346: 
347: Configuration is essential for any non-trivial Flask application. The `app.config` object provides a centralized, dictionary-like store for all your application settings.
348: 
349: *   We learned that configuration helps separate settings (like `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, database URLs) from application code.
350: *   `app.config` is the central object, behaving like a dictionary.
351: *   We explored various ways to load configuration: directly in code, from Python objects (`from_object`), from Python files (`from_pyfile`), and via environment variables pointing to files (`from_envvar`).
352: *   We saw that loading order matters, allowing defaults to be overridden by deployment-specific settings.
353: *   Configuration can be accessed using `app.config` or `current_app.config`.
354: 
355: Properly managing configuration makes your application more secure, flexible, and easier to deploy and maintain across different environments.
356: 
357: Now that we've covered the main building blocks – the application object, routing, request/response handling, templating, context globals, and configuration – you might be wondering about the "magic" behind those context globals (`request`, `current_app`, etc.). How does Flask manage their state, especially when handling multiple requests? Let's delve deeper into the mechanics of contexts.
358: 
359: Ready to understand the context lifecycle? Let's move on to [Chapter 7: Application and Request Contexts](07_application_and_request_contexts.md).

  8: # Chapter 7: Application and Request Contexts
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 6: Configuration (`Config`)](06_configuration___config__.md), we learned how to manage settings for our Flask application using the `app.config` object. And in [Chapter 5: Context Globals (`current_app`, `request`, `session`, `g`)](05_context_globals___current_app____request____session____g__.md), we met special variables like `request` and `current_app` that seem to magically know about the current request or application.
 11: 
 12: But how does Flask keep track of which request is which, especially if multiple users are accessing our web app at the same time? How does it ensure that `request` refers to *User A's* request when handling User A, and *User B's* request when handling User B? This magic is managed by **Application and Request Contexts**.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Do They Solve? Keeping Things Separate
 15: 
 16: Imagine you're working at a busy service desk. Many people come up asking for different things simultaneously. You need a way to keep each person's request and related information separate from everyone else's. You can't just use one shared notepad for everyone – that would be chaos! Instead, for each person, you might create a temporary folder or workspace to hold their specific documents and details while you help them.
 17: 
 18: In a web application, your Flask server might be handling requests from many different users at the same time. Each request has its own data (like form submissions or URL parameters) and potentially its own user session. Storing this information in simple global variables in your Python code would be disastrous, as data from one request could overwrite or interfere with data from another.
 19: 
 20: Flask uses **Contexts** to solve this problem. Contexts act like those temporary, isolated workspaces. They ensure that variables like `request`, `session`, `current_app`, and `g` always point to the information relevant to the *specific task* Flask is currently working on (usually, handling one particular incoming web request).
 21: 
 22: ## The Two Main Types of Contexts
 23: 
 24: Flask has two primary types of contexts:
 25: 
 26: 1.  **Application Context (`AppContext`):**
 27:     *   **Analogy:** Think of this as the main office building or the overall project workspace.
 28:     *   **Purpose:** It holds information related to the application instance itself, regardless of any specific web request. It binds the `current_app` proxy (pointing to your `Flask` app instance) and the `g` proxy (a temporary storage space).
 29:     *   **When is it active?** It's automatically active *during* a web request. It's also needed for tasks *outside* of web requests that still need access to the application, such as running command-line interface (CLI) commands (like database migrations) or background jobs.
 30: 
 31: 2.  **Request Context (`RequestContext`):**
 32:     *   **Analogy:** Think of this as a specific meeting room set up just for handling one client's request (one incoming web request).
 33:     *   **Purpose:** It holds information specific to *one single incoming web request*. It binds the `request` proxy (containing details of the HTTP request) and the `session` proxy (for user-specific session data).
 34:     *   **When is it active?** Flask automatically creates and activates a Request Context when a web request comes in, and removes it after the request is handled.
 35:     *   **Relationship:** A Request Context *always* includes an Application Context within it. You can't have a meeting room (`RequestContext`) without being inside the main office building (`AppContext`).
 36: 
 37: Here's a simple breakdown:
 38: 
 39: | Context Type      | Analogy              | Key Globals Bound | Typical Use Case                     | Lifespan                                        |
 40: | :---------------- | :------------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
 41: | Application       | Main Office Building | `current_app`, `g`  | CLI commands, background tasks | Active during requests, or manually activated |
 42: | Request           | Temporary Meeting Room | `request`, `session` | Handling a single web request      | Created/destroyed for each web request        |
 43: 
 44: ## How Flask Uses Contexts Automatically (During Requests)
 45: 
 46: Most of the time, you don't need to worry about manually managing contexts. When a browser sends a request to your Flask application:
 47: 
 48: 1.  **Request Arrives:** Your WSGI server (like the Flask development server) receives the HTTP request.
 49: 2.  **Context Creation:** Flask automatically creates a `RequestContext` object based on the incoming request details (the WSGI environment).
 50: 3.  **Context Pushing:** Flask *pushes* this `RequestContext`. This does two things:
 51:     *   It makes the `request` and `session` proxies point to the specific request and session objects for *this* request.
 52:     *   It *also* pushes an `AppContext` (if one isn't already active for this thread/task), making `current_app` and `g` point to the correct application and a fresh `g` object. "Pushing" is like activating that temporary workspace.
 53: 4.  **Code Execution:** Your view function runs. Because the contexts are active, you can freely use `request`, `session`, `current_app`, and `g` inside your function, and they will refer to the correct objects for the current request.
 54: 5.  **Response Sent:** Your view function returns a response.
 55: 6.  **Context Popping:** After the response is sent, Flask *pops* the `RequestContext` (and the `AppContext` if it was pushed along with it). This cleans up the workspace, effectively deactivating those specific `request`, `session`, and `g` objects for that request.
 56: 
 57: This automatic push/pop mechanism ensures that each request is handled in its own isolated context, preventing data clashes between concurrent requests.
 58: 
 59: ## Manually Pushing Contexts (Outside Requests)
 60: 
 61: What if you need to access application settings or resources *outside* of a typical web request? For example, maybe you have a separate Python script (`init_db.py`) that needs to initialize your database using configuration stored in `app.config`. Since there's no incoming web request, Flask won't automatically create any contexts.
 62: 
 63: In these cases, you need to manually push an **Application Context** using `app.app_context()`.
 64: 
 65: ```python
 66: # init_db.py (Example script to run from command line)
 67: 
 68: from flask import Flask
 69: 
 70: # Assume your main Flask app object is defined in hello.py
 71: # We need to import it here.
 72: # In a real project, you'd structure this better, maybe using a factory function.
 73: try:
 74:     # Let's assume hello.py has app = Flask(__name__)
 75:     from hello import app
 76: except ImportError:
 77:     print("Could not import 'app' from hello.py")
 78:     print("Make sure hello.py exists and defines the Flask app.")
 79:     exit(1)
 80: 
 81: # Define a function that needs app access
 82: def setup_database():
 83:     # We need an application context to access current_app.config
 84:     # Without the 'with' block, current_app would not be available here.
 85:     with app.app_context():
 86:         # Now we can safely access app configuration via current_app
 87:         db_uri = app.config.get('DATABASE_URI', 'No DB URI Set!')
 88:         print(f"Inside app context: Accessing config...")
 89:         print(f"Database URI found: {db_uri}")
 90:         # Imagine database setup code here that uses the URI
 91:         print("Database initialization logic would run here.")
 92: 
 93: # ---- Main execution part of the script ----
 94: if __name__ == "__main__":
 95:     print("Running database setup script...")
 96:     setup_database()
 97:     print("Script finished.")
 98: 
 99: ```
100: 
101: **Explanation:**
102: 
103: *   `from hello import app`: We import the actual `Flask` application instance.
104: *   `with app.app_context():`: This is the key part! It creates an application context for the `app` instance and pushes it, making it active within the `with` block.
105: *   Inside the block, `current_app` becomes available and correctly points to our `app` object. We can now safely access `current_app.config`.
106: *   When the `with` block exits, the application context is automatically popped.
107: 
108: **To run this (assuming `hello.py` exists and defines `app`):**
109: 
110: 1.  Save the code above as `init_db.py` in the same directory as `hello.py`.
111: 2.  Optionally, add `app.config['DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///mydatabase.db'` to `hello.py` to see it picked up.
112: 3.  Run from your terminal: `python init_db.py`
113: 4.  You'll see output showing that the config was accessed successfully *inside* the context.
114: 
115: Similarly, if you need to simulate a request environment (perhaps for testing helper functions that rely on `request`), you can use `app.test_request_context()` which pushes both a Request and Application context.
116: 
117: ```python
118: # example_test_context.py
119: from hello import app # Assuming hello.py defines app = Flask(__name__)
120: 
121: # A helper function that might be used inside a view
122: def get_user_agent_info():
123:     # This function relies on the 'request' context global
124:     from flask import request
125:     user_agent = request.headers.get('User-Agent', 'Unknown')
126:     return f"Request came from: {user_agent}"
127: 
128: # --- Simulate calling the function outside a real request ---
129: if __name__ == "__main__":
130:     # Create a test request context for a fake GET request to '/'
131:     # This pushes both Request and App contexts
132:     with app.test_request_context('/', method='GET'):
133:         # Now, inside this block, 'request' is available!
134:         print("Inside test request context...")
135:         agent_info = get_user_agent_info()
136:         print(agent_info)
137: 
138:     print("Outside context.")
139:     # Trying to call get_user_agent_info() here would fail because
140:     # the request context has been popped.
141: ```
142: 
143: ## Under the Hood: Context Locals and Stacks
144: 
145: How does Flask actually manage these contexts and make the globals like `request` point to the right object?
146: 
147: Historically, Flask used thread-local storage and maintained stacks of contexts for each thread. When `request` was accessed, it would look at the top of the request context stack *for the current thread*.
148: 
149: Modern Flask (leveraging updates in its core dependency, Werkzeug) relies on Python's built-in `contextvars` module. This module provides a more robust way to manage context-specific state that works correctly with both threads and modern asynchronous programming (like `async`/`await`).
150: 
151: Here's a simplified conceptual idea:
152: 
153: 1.  **Context Variables:** Flask defines special "context variables" (using `contextvars.ContextVar`) for the application context (`_cv_app`) and the request context (`_cv_request`). Think of these like special slots that can hold different values depending on the current execution context (the specific request being handled).
154: 2.  **Pushing:** When Flask pushes a context (e.g., `RequestContext.push()`), it stores the actual context object (like the `RequestContext` instance for the current request) into the corresponding context variable (`_cv_request.set(the_request_context)`).
155: 3.  **Proxies:** The context globals (`request`, `session`, `current_app`, `g`) are special `LocalProxy` objects (from Werkzeug). They don't hold the data directly.
156: 4.  **Proxy Access:** When you access something like `request.args`, the `request` proxy does the following:
157:     *   Looks up the *current* value stored in the `_cv_request` context variable. This gives it the *actual* `RequestContext` object for the currently active request.
158:     *   Retrieves the real `request` object stored *within* that `RequestContext`.
159:     *   Finally, accesses the `.args` attribute on that real request object.
160: 5.  **Popping:** When Flask pops a context (e.g., `RequestContext.pop()`), it resets the context variable (`_cv_request.reset(token)`), effectively clearing that slot for the current context.
161: 
162: This `contextvars` mechanism ensures that even if your server is handling many requests concurrently (in different threads or async tasks), each one has its own isolated value for `_cv_app` and `_cv_request`, so the proxies always resolve to the correct objects for the task at hand.
163: 
164: Let's visualize the request lifecycle with contexts:
165: 
166: ```mermaid
167: sequenceDiagram
168:     participant Browser
169:     participant FlaskApp as Flask App (WSGI)
170:     participant Contexts as Context Management
171:     participant YourView as Your View Function
172:     participant Globals as request Proxy
173: 
174:     Browser->>+FlaskApp: Sends GET /user/alice
175:     FlaskApp->>+Contexts: Request arrives, create RequestContext (incl. AppContext)
176:     Contexts->>Contexts: Push RequestContext (sets _cv_request)
177:     Contexts->>Contexts: Push AppContext (sets _cv_app)
178:     Note over Contexts: request, session, current_app, g are now active
179:     FlaskApp->>+YourView: Calls view_func(username='alice')
180:     YourView->>+Globals: Access request.method
181:     Globals->>Contexts: Lookup _cv_request -> finds current RequestContext
182:     Globals-->>YourView: Returns 'GET' (from real request object)
183:     YourView-->>-FlaskApp: Returns Response("Hello Alice")
184:     FlaskApp->>+Contexts: Response sent, Pop RequestContext (resets _cv_request)
185:     Contexts->>Contexts: Pop AppContext (resets _cv_app)
186:     Note over Contexts: Context globals are now unbound for this request
187:     FlaskApp-->>-Browser: Sends HTTP Response
188: ```
189: 
190: This diagram shows that Flask sets up (pushes) the context before calling your view and tears it down (pops) afterwards, allowing the proxies like `request` to find the right data while your code runs.
191: 
192: ## Conclusion
193: 
194: Contexts are fundamental to how Flask manages state during the lifecycle of the application and individual requests. They provide isolated workspaces to prevent data from different requests interfering with each other.
195: 
196: *   **Application Context (`AppContext`):** Provides access to the application (`current_app`) and global storage (`g`). Used implicitly during requests and manually via `app.app_context()` for tasks like CLI commands.
197: *   **Request Context (`RequestContext`):** Provides access to request-specific data (`request`) and the user session (`session`). Automatically managed by Flask during the web request cycle. Contains an `AppContext`.
198: *   **Context Globals:** Proxies like `request` and `current_app` rely on the currently active contexts to find the correct objects.
199: *   **Management:** Flask usually handles context push/pop automatically for web requests. Manual pushing (`app.app_context()`, `app.test_request_context()`) is needed for specific scenarios like scripts, background jobs, or testing.
200: 
201: Understanding contexts helps explain how Flask allows convenient access to request and application data through globals while maintaining safety and isolation between concurrent operations.
202: 
203: Now that we understand how Flask manages state and configuration for the core application, how do we organize larger applications with multiple sections or features? That's where Blueprints come in.
204: 
205: Let's learn how to structure our projects in [Chapter 8: Blueprints](08_blueprints.md).

  8: # Chapter 8: Blueprints
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 7: Application and Request Contexts](07_application_and_request_contexts.md), we explored the "magic" behind Flask's context system, understanding how variables like `request` and `current_app` work reliably even with multiple concurrent requests.
 11: 
 12: Now, imagine your simple "Hello, World!" application starts growing. You add user profiles, an admin section, maybe a blog. Putting all your routes, view functions, and related logic into a single Python file (like our `hello.py`) quickly becomes messy and hard to manage. How can we organize our growing Flask application into smaller, more manageable pieces?
 13: 
 14: That's where **Blueprints** come in!
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Do They Solve? Organizing a Growing House
 17: 
 18: Think about building a house. You wouldn't try to build the kitchen, bathroom, and bedrooms all mixed together in one big pile. Instead, you might have separate plans or even pre-fabricated modules for each section. The kitchen module has its specific plumbing and electrical needs, the bathroom has its fixtures, etc. Once these modules are ready, you assemble them into the main structure of the house.
 19: 
 20: Similarly, as your Flask application grows, you want to group related features together. For example:
 21: 
 22: *   All the routes related to user authentication (`/login`, `/logout`, `/register`).
 23: *   All the routes for an admin control panel (`/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/users`).
 24: *   All the routes for a public-facing blog (`/blog`, `/blog/<post_slug>`).
 25: 
 26: Trying to manage all these in one file leads to:
 27: 
 28: *   **Clutter:** The main application file becomes huge and hard to navigate.
 29: *   **Confusion:** It's difficult to see which routes belong to which feature.
 30: *   **Poor Reusability:** If you wanted to reuse the "blog" part in another project, it would be hard to extract just that code.
 31: 
 32: **Blueprints** provide Flask's solution for this. They let you define collections of routes, view functions, templates, and static files as separate modules. You can develop these modules independently and then "register" them with your main Flask application, potentially multiple times or under different URL prefixes.
 33: 
 34: They are like the **prefabricated sections of your house**. You build the "user authentication module" (a blueprint) separately, then plug it into your main application structure.
 35: 
 36: ## Creating and Using a Simple Blueprint
 37: 
 38: Let's see how this works. Imagine we want to create a separate section for user-related pages.
 39: 
 40: 1.  **Create a Blueprint Object:** Instead of using `@app.route()`, we first create a `Blueprint` object.
 41: 2.  **Define Routes on the Blueprint:** We use decorators like `@bp.route()` (where `bp` is our blueprint object) to define routes *within* that blueprint.
 42: 3.  **Register the Blueprint with the App:** In our main application file, we tell the Flask `app` object about our blueprint using `app.register_blueprint()`.
 43: 
 44: Let's structure our project. We'll have our main `app.py` and a separate file for our user routes, maybe inside a `blueprints` folder:
 45: 
 46: ```
 47: yourproject/
 48: ├── app.py              # Main Flask application setup
 49: ├── blueprints/
 50: │   └── __init__.py     # Makes 'blueprints' a Python package (can be empty)
 51: │   └── user.py         # Our user blueprint routes
 52: └── templates/
 53:     └── user/
 54:         └── profile.html # Template for the user profile
 55: ```
 56: 
 57: **Step 1 & 2: Define the Blueprint (`blueprints/user.py`)**
 58: 
 59: ```python
 60: # blueprints/user.py
 61: from flask import Blueprint, render_template, abort
 62: 
 63: # 1. Create the Blueprint object
 64: # 'user' is the name of the blueprint. Used internally by Flask.
 65: # __name__ helps locate the blueprint's resources (like templates).
 66: # template_folder specifies where to look for this blueprint's templates.
 67: user_bp = Blueprint('user', __name__, template_folder='../templates/user')
 68: 
 69: # Sample user data (replace with database logic in a real app)
 70: users = {
 71:     "alice": {"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"},
 72:     "bob": {"name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com"},
 73: }
 74: 
 75: # 2. Define routes ON THE BLUEPRINT using @user_bp.route()
 76: @user_bp.route('/profile/<username>')
 77: def profile(username):
 78:   user_info = users.get(username)
 79:   if not user_info:
 80:     abort(404) # User not found
 81:   # Note: render_template will now look in 'templates/user/' first
 82:   # because of template_folder='../templates/user' in Blueprint()
 83:   return render_template('profile.html', user=user_info)
 84: 
 85: @user_bp.route('/')
 86: def user_list():
 87:     # A simple view within the user blueprint
 88:     return f"List of users: {', '.join(users.keys())}"
 89: ```
 90: 
 91: **Explanation:**
 92: 
 93: *   `from flask import Blueprint`: We import the `Blueprint` class.
 94: *   `user_bp = Blueprint('user', __name__, template_folder='../templates/user')`: We create an instance.
 95:     *   `'user'`: The name of this blueprint. This is used later for generating URLs (`url_for`).
 96:     *   `__name__`: Helps Flask determine the blueprint's root path, similar to how it works for the main `Flask` app object ([Chapter 1](01_application_object___flask__.md)).
 97:     *   `template_folder='../templates/user'`: Tells this blueprint where its specific templates are located relative to `user.py`.
 98: *   `@user_bp.route(...)`: We define routes using the blueprint object, *not* the main `app` object.
 99: 
100: **Step 3: Register the Blueprint (`app.py`)**
101: 
102: Now, we need to tell our main Flask application about this blueprint.
103: 
104: ```python
105: # app.py
106: from flask import Flask
107: from blueprints.user import user_bp # Import the blueprint object
108: 
109: app = Flask(__name__)
110: # We might have other config here, like SECRET_KEY from Chapter 6
111: # app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your secret key'
112: 
113: # Register the blueprint with the main application
114: # We can add a url_prefix here!
115: app.register_blueprint(user_bp, url_prefix='/users')
116: 
117: # Maybe add a simple homepage route directly on the app
118: @app.route('/')
119: def home():
120:   return 'Welcome to the main application!'
121: 
122: if __name__ == '__main__':
123:   app.run(debug=True)
124: ```
125: 
126: **Explanation:**
127: 
128: *   `from blueprints.user import user_bp`: We import the `Blueprint` instance we created in `user.py`.
129: *   `app.register_blueprint(user_bp, url_prefix='/users')`: This is the crucial step.
130:     *   It tells the `app` object to include all the routes defined in `user_bp`.
131:     *   `url_prefix='/users'`: This is very useful! It means all routes defined *within* the `user_bp` will automatically be prefixed with `/users`.
132:         *   The `/profile/<username>` route in `user.py` becomes `/users/profile/<username>`.
133:         *   The `/` route in `user.py` becomes `/users/`.
134: 
135: **Template (`templates/user/profile.html`)**
136: 
137: ```html
138: <!-- templates/user/profile.html -->
139: <!doctype html>
140: <html>
141: <head><title>User Profile</title></head>
142: <body>
143:   <h1>Profile for {{ user.name }}</h1>
144:   <p>Email: {{ user.email }}</p>
145:   <p><a href="{{ url_for('user.user_list') }}">Back to User List</a></p>
146:   <p><a href="{{ url_for('home') }}">Back to Home</a></p>
147: </body>
148: </html>
149: ```
150: 
151: **Running this:**
152: 
153: 1.  Create the directory structure and files as shown above.
154: 2.  Run `python app.py` in your terminal.
155: 3.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You'll see "Welcome to the main application!" (Handled by `app.py`).
156: 4.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/`. You'll see "List of users: alice, bob" (Handled by `user.py`, route `/`, with prefix `/users`).
157: 5.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/profile/alice`. You'll see the profile page for Alice (Handled by `user.py`, route `/profile/<username>`, with prefix `/users`).
158: 6.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/profile/charlie`. You'll get a 404 Not Found error, as handled by `profile()` in `user.py`.
159: 
160: Notice how the blueprint allowed us to neatly separate the user-related code into `blueprints/user.py`, keeping `app.py` cleaner. The `url_prefix` made it easy to group all user routes under `/users/`.
161: 
162: ## Generating URLs with `url_for` and Blueprints
163: 
164: How does `url_for` work when routes are defined in blueprints? You need to prefix the endpoint name with the **blueprint name**, followed by a dot (`.`).
165: 
166: Look back at the `profile.html` template:
167: 
168: *   `{{ url_for('user.user_list') }}`: Generates the URL for the `user_list` view function *within* the `user` blueprint. Because of the `url_prefix='/users'`, this generates `/users/`.
169: *   `{{ url_for('user.profile', username='alice') }}` (if used in Python): Would generate `/users/profile/alice`.
170: *   `{{ url_for('home') }}`: Generates the URL for the `home` view function, which is registered directly on the `app`, not a blueprint. This generates `/`.
171: 
172: If you are generating a URL for an endpoint *within the same blueprint*, you can use a dot prefix for a relative link:
173: 
174: ```python
175: # Inside blueprints/user.py
176: from flask import url_for
177: 
178: @user_bp.route('/link-example')
179: def link_example():
180:     # Generate URL for 'profile' endpoint within the *same* blueprint ('user')
181:     alice_url = url_for('.profile', username='alice') # Note the leading dot!
182:     # alice_url will be '/users/profile/alice'
183: 
184:     # Generate URL for the main app's 'home' endpoint
185:     home_url = url_for('home') # No dot needed for app routes
186:     # home_url will be '/'
187: 
188:     return f'Alice profile: {alice_url}<br>Homepage: {home_url}'
189: ```
190: 
191: Using the blueprint name (`user.profile`) or the relative dot (`.profile`) ensures `url_for` finds the correct endpoint, even if multiple blueprints happen to use the same view function name (like `index`).
192: 
193: ## Blueprint Resources: Templates and Static Files
194: 
195: As we saw, you can specify `template_folder` when creating a `Blueprint`. When `render_template('profile.html')` is called from within the `user_bp`'s `profile` view, Flask (via Jinja2's `DispatchingJinjaLoader`, see [Chapter 4](04_templating__jinja2_integration_.md)) will look for `profile.html` in this order:
196: 
197: 1.  The application's template folder (`templates/`).
198: 2.  The blueprint's template folder (`templates/user/` in our example).
199: 
200: This allows blueprints to have their own templates, potentially overriding application-wide templates if needed, but usually just keeping them organized.
201: 
202: Similarly, you can specify a `static_folder` and `static_url_path` for a blueprint. This allows a blueprint to bundle its own CSS, JavaScript, or image files.
203: 
204: ```python
205: # blueprints/admin.py
206: admin_bp = Blueprint('admin', __name__,
207:                      static_folder='static', # Look in blueprints/admin/static/
208:                      static_url_path='/admin-static', # URL like /admin-static/style.css
209:                      template_folder='templates') # Look in blueprints/admin/templates/
210: 
211: # Then register with the app:
212: # app.register_blueprint(admin_bp, url_prefix='/admin')
213: ```
214: 
215: Accessing blueprint static files uses `url_for` with the special `static` endpoint, prefixed by the blueprint name:
216: 
217: ```html
218: <!-- Inside an admin blueprint template -->
219: <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('admin.static', filename='style.css') }}">
220: <!-- Generates a URL like: /admin-static/style.css -->
221: ```
222: 
223: ## Under the Hood: How Registration Works
224: 
225: What actually happens when you call `app.register_blueprint(bp)`?
226: 
227: 1.  **Deferred Functions:** When you use decorators like `@bp.route`, `@bp.before_request`, `@bp.errorhandler`, etc., on a `Blueprint` object, the blueprint doesn't immediately tell the application about them. Instead, it stores these actions as "deferred functions" in a list (`bp.deferred_functions`). See `Blueprint.route` calling `Blueprint.add_url_rule`, which calls `Blueprint.record`.
228: 2.  **Registration Call:** `app.register_blueprint(bp, url_prefix='/users')` is called.
229: 3.  **State Creation:** The application creates a `BlueprintSetupState` object. This object holds references to the blueprint (`bp`), the application (`app`), and the options passed during registration (like `url_prefix='/users'`).
230: 4.  **Recording the Blueprint:** The app adds the blueprint to its `app.blueprints` dictionary. This is important for routing and `url_for`.
231: 5.  **Executing Deferred Functions:** The app iterates through the list of `deferred_functions` stored in the blueprint. For each deferred function, it calls it, passing the `BlueprintSetupState` object.
232: 6.  **Applying Settings:** Inside the deferred function (which was created back when you used, e.g., `@bp.route`), the function now has access to both the original arguments (`'/'`, `view_func`, etc.) and the setup state (`state`).
233:     *   For a route, the deferred function typically calls `state.add_url_rule(...)`.
234:     *   `state.add_url_rule` then calls `app.add_url_rule(...)`, but it *modifies* the arguments first:
235:         *   It prepends the `url_prefix` from the `state` (e.g., `/users`) to the route's `rule`.
236:         *   It prepends the blueprint's name (`state.name`, e.g., `user`) plus a dot to the route's `endpoint` (e.g., `profile` becomes `user.profile`).
237:         *   It applies other options like `subdomain`.
238:     *   For other decorators like `@bp.before_request`, the deferred function registers the handler function in the appropriate application dictionary (e.g., `app.before_request_funcs`) but uses the blueprint's name as the key (or `None` for app-wide handlers added via the blueprint).
239: 7.  **Nested Blueprints:** If the blueprint being registered itself contains nested blueprints, the registration process is called recursively for those nested blueprints, adjusting prefixes and names accordingly.
240: 
241: Here's a simplified diagram for registering a route via a blueprint:
242: 
243: ```mermaid
244: sequenceDiagram
245:     participant Code as Your Code (e.g., user.py)
246:     participant BP as user_bp (Blueprint obj)
247:     participant App as Main App (Flask obj)
248:     participant State as BlueprintSetupState
249: 
250:     Code->>+BP: @user_bp.route('/profile/<name>')
251:     BP->>BP: record(deferred_add_rule_func)
252:     BP-->>-Code: Decorator applied
253: 
254:     Note over App: Later, in app.py...
255:     App->>App: app.register_blueprint(user_bp, url_prefix='/users')
256:     App->>+State: Create BlueprintSetupState(bp=user_bp, app=app, options={...})
257:     State-->>-App: Return state object
258:     App->>BP: For func in user_bp.deferred_functions:
259:     Note right of BP: func = deferred_add_rule_func
260:     App->>BP: func(state)
261:     BP->>+State: deferred_add_rule_func calls state.add_url_rule('/profile/<name>', ...)
262:     State->>App: Calls app.add_url_rule('/users/profile/<name>', endpoint='user.profile', ...)
263:     App->>App: Adds rule to app.url_map
264:     State-->>-BP: add_url_rule finished
265:     BP-->>App: Deferred function finished
266: ```
267: 
268: The key idea is **deferral**. Blueprints record actions but don't apply them until they are registered on an actual application, using the `BlueprintSetupState` to correctly prefix routes and endpoints.
269: 
270: ## Conclusion
271: 
272: Blueprints are Flask's powerful solution for organizing larger applications. They allow you to group related routes, views, templates, and static files into modular, reusable components.
273: 
274: *   We learned how to **create** a `Blueprint` object.
275: *   We saw how to **define routes** and other handlers using blueprint decorators (`@bp.route`, `@bp.before_request`, etc.).
276: *   We learned how to **register** a blueprint with the main application using `app.register_blueprint()`, optionally specifying a `url_prefix`.
277: *   We understood how `url_for` works with blueprint endpoints (using `blueprint_name.endpoint_name` or `.endpoint_name`).
278: *   Blueprints help keep your codebase **organized, maintainable, and modular**.
279: 
280: By breaking down your application into logical blueprints, you can manage complexity much more effectively as your project grows. This structure also makes it easier for teams to work on different parts of the application simultaneously.
281: 
282: This concludes our core tutorial on Flask's fundamental concepts! You now have a solid understanding of the Application Object, Routing, Request/Response, Templating, Context Globals, Configuration, Contexts, and Blueprints. With these tools, you're well-equipped to start building your own web applications with Flask.
283: 
284: From here, you might explore Flask extensions for common tasks (like database integration with Flask-SQLAlchemy, user authentication with Flask-Login, form handling with Flask-WTF), delve into testing your Flask applications, or learn about different deployment strategies. Happy Flasking!

  8: # Chapter 1: Agent Card - The AI's Business Card
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol tutorial! Imagine a world full of helpful AI assistants, or "agents." Maybe one agent is great at translating languages, another excels at summarizing long documents, and a third can book appointments. How do these agents, potentially built by different companies using different technologies, find each other and figure out how to work together?
 11: 
 12: That's where the **Agent Card** comes in. It solves the problem of **discovery** – how one agent or application can learn about another agent's existence, capabilities, and how to communicate with it.
 13: 
 14: Think of it like this:
 15: 
 16: *   **You want to hire a plumber.** How do you find one? You might look them up online, find their website, or get their business card. This tells you their name, what services they offer (fixing leaks, installing pipes), and how to contact them (phone number, address).
 17: *   **An application (or another agent) wants to use an AI agent.** How does it find one? It looks for the agent's **Agent Card**.
 18: 
 19: ## What is an Agent Card?
 20: 
 21: An **Agent Card** is a small, standardized file, usually named `agent.json`, that acts like a public profile or digital business card for an AI agent. It's typically hosted by the agent itself at a predictable web address.
 22: 
 23: This card contains essential information:
 24: 
 25: 1.  **Who is the agent?** (Name, description, version, who made it)
 26: 2.  **What can it do?** (List of skills, like "translate_text" or "summarize_document")
 27: 3.  **How do I talk to it?** (The agent's web address/URL, what kind of inputs it understands - text, files, structured data?)
 28: 4.  **Does it have special features?** (Like supporting real-time updates via streaming?)
 29: 
 30: By reading this card, other agents or applications can quickly understand if this agent is the right one for a job and exactly how to start a conversation (or, in technical terms, initiate a [Task](02_task.md)).
 31: 
 32: ## Finding and Reading the Card (Discovery)
 33: 
 34: Just like many websites have a standard `robots.txt` file to tell search engines what to do, A2A agents typically make their Agent Card available at a standard path: `/.well-known/agent.json`.
 35: 
 36: So, if an agent lives at `http://my-translator-agent.com`, its Agent Card would likely be found at `http://my-translator-agent.com/.well-known/agent.json`.
 37: 
 38: Let's see how a client application might fetch this card using Python.
 39: 
 40: ```python
 41: # File: demo/ui/utils/agent_card.py (simplified)
 42: import requests # A library to make web requests
 43: from common.types import AgentCard # A helper to understand the card's structure
 44: 
 45: def get_agent_card(remote_agent_address: str) -> AgentCard:
 46:   """Gets the agent card from the agent's address."""
 47:   agent_card_url = f"{remote_agent_address}/.well-known/agent.json"
 48:   print(f"Fetching card from: {agent_card_url}")
 49:   # Make a web request to get the file
 50:   response = requests.get(agent_card_url)
 51:   response.raise_for_status() # Check if the request was successful
 52:   # Parse the JSON file content into an AgentCard object
 53:   return AgentCard(**response.json())
 54: 
 55: # Example Usage:
 56: agent_address = "http://example-agent.com" # Assume our agent is here
 57: try:
 58:   card = get_agent_card(agent_address)
 59:   print(f"Got card for agent: {card.name}")
 60: except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
 61:   print(f"Could not fetch card: {e}")
 62: ```
 63: 
 64: **Explanation:**
 65: 
 66: 1.  We define the `agent_address` where the agent lives.
 67: 2.  The function builds the full URL to the standard `agent.json` path.
 68: 3.  It uses the `requests` library to make an HTTP GET request, just like your web browser does when you visit a page.
 69: 4.  If the request is successful (HTTP status 200 OK), it takes the JSON text returned by the server and parses it into a structured `AgentCard` object that the program can easily use.
 70: 
 71: ### Example `agent.json`
 72: 
 73: Here's a simplified example of what the `agent.json` file might look like:
 74: 
 75: ```json
 76: // File: /.well-known/agent.json (Example)
 77: {
 78:   "name": "Text Summarizer Bot",
 79:   "description": "Summarizes long text documents.",
 80:   "version": "1.0.0",
 81:   "url": "http://example-agent.com/a2a", // Where to send tasks
 82:   "capabilities": {
 83:     "streaming": false // Doesn't support real-time updates
 84:   },
 85:   "defaultInputModes": ["text"], // Primarily accepts text
 86:   "defaultOutputModes": ["text"], // Primarily outputs text
 87:   "skills": [
 88:     {
 89:       "id": "summarize",
 90:       "name": "Summarize Text",
 91:       "description": "Provide text, get a short summary."
 92:     }
 93:   ],
 94:   "provider": {
 95:     "organization": "AI Helpers Inc."
 96:   }
 97: }
 98: ```
 99: 
100: **Explanation:**
101: 
102: *   `name`, `description`, `version`, `provider`: Basic identification info.
103: *   `url`: The specific endpoint *within* the agent's server where A2A communication happens (we'll use this later when sending a [Task](02_task.md)).
104: *   `capabilities`: Tells us if it supports advanced features like `streaming`. This one doesn't.
105: *   `defaultInputModes`/`defaultOutputModes`: What kind of data it generally works with (here, just plain `text`).
106: *   `skills`: A list of specific things this agent can do. This one has a "summarize" skill.
107: 
108: ## Under the Hood: The Discovery Flow
109: 
110: How does fetching the Agent Card actually work between the client and the agent (server)? It's a simple web request:
111: 
112: ```mermaid
113: sequenceDiagram
114:     participant C as Client App
115:     participant A as Agent Server
116:     C->>A: GET /.well-known/agent.json
117:     Note right of A: Agent looks for its agent.json file
118:     A-->>C: 200 OK (Returns content of agent.json)
119:     Note left of C: Client parses the JSON data
120: ```
121: 
122: **Steps:**
123: 
124: 1.  **Client Request:** The client application (e.g., our Python script) sends an HTTP GET request to the agent's base URL + `/.well-known/agent.json`.
125: 2.  **Server Response:** The agent's server receives the request, finds its `agent.json` file, and sends its content back to the client with a success status (like `200 OK`).
126: 3.  **Client Processing:** The client receives the JSON data and processes it to understand the agent's capabilities.
127: 
128: The provided sample code includes helper classes to make this easier:
129: 
130: *   **Python:** The `A2ACardResolver` class (`samples/python/common/client/card_resolver.py`) handles fetching and parsing the card.
131: *   **JavaScript:** The `cli.ts` sample (`samples/js/src/cli.ts`) uses the standard `fetch` API to get the card directly.
132: 
133: ```typescript
134: // File: samples/js/src/cli.ts (Relevant Snippet)
135: async function fetchAndDisplayAgentCard() {
136:   const wellKnownUrl = new URL("/.well-known/agent.json", serverUrl).toString();
137:   console.log(`Attempting to fetch agent card from: ${wellKnownUrl}`);
138:   try {
139:     // Use browser's fetch to get the card
140:     const response = await fetch(wellKnownUrl);
141:     if (response.ok) {
142:       const card: AgentCard = await response.json(); // Parse JSON
143:       agentName = card.name || "Agent";
144:       console.log(`✓ Agent Card Found: ${agentName}`);
145:       // ... display other card info ...
146:     } else {
147:       console.log(`⚠️ Could not fetch agent card (Status: ${response.status})`);
148:     }
149:   } catch (error: any) {
150:     console.log(`⚠️ Error fetching agent card: ${error.message}`);
151:   }
152: }
153: ```
154: 
155: This JavaScript code does essentially the same thing as the Python example: builds the URL, fetches the content, and parses the JSON if successful.
156: 
157: ## Conclusion
158: 
159: The Agent Card is the cornerstone of discovery in the A2A protocol. It's the agent's public announcement, telling the world who it is, what it can do, and how to interact with it. By fetching and reading this simple `agent.json` file, clients can dynamically discover and prepare to communicate with diverse AI agents.
160: 
161: Now that we understand how to *find* an agent and learn its basic properties using the Agent Card, we need to learn how to actually *give it work* to do. This brings us to the concept of a **Task**.
162: 
163: Ready to learn how to ask an agent to perform an action? Let's move on to the next chapter!

  8: # Chapter 2: Task - The AI's Work Order
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](01_agent_card.md), we learned how to find an AI agent and read its "business card" – the **Agent Card** – to understand what it can do and how to contact it. Think of it like finding a translator's contact information.
 11: 
 12: But just knowing the translator exists isn't enough. You need to actually *give them something to translate*! How do you formally request work from an A2A agent?
 13: 
 14: That's where the **Task** comes in. It solves the problem of **requesting and tracking work**.
 15: 
 16: ## What is a Task?
 17: 
 18: Imagine you run a busy workshop. When a customer comes in wanting something built or fixed, you don't just rely on a verbal request. You create a **work order** or a **job ticket**. This ticket contains:
 19: 
 20: 1.  **What needs to be done?** (The customer's request - e.g., "Build a small bookshelf")
 21: 2.  **Who requested it?** (Customer details)
 22: 3.  **A unique ID** to track this specific job.
 23: 4.  **The current status** (e.g., "Not Started", "In Progress", "Awaiting Materials", "Completed").
 24: 5.  **The final result** (e.g., the finished bookshelf, or notes about why it couldn't be done).
 25: 
 26: In the A2A world, a **Task** is exactly like that work order. It's the main way agents exchange work:
 27: 
 28: 1.  **Instructions:** It starts with the initial request message from the client (e.g., "Translate 'hello world' to French").
 29: 2.  **Tracking ID:** Each task gets a unique ID so both the client and the agent know which job they're talking about.
 30: 3.  **Status:** It has a state that changes as the agent works on it (e.g., `submitted`, `working`, `completed`, `failed`).
 31: 4.  **Results:** When finished, it holds the output, called **Artifacts** (e.g., the translated text "Bonjour le monde").
 32: 
 33: So, if our "Translator Agent" receives a Task asking for a translation, that Task object will contain the text to translate, track whether the agent is currently translating it, and eventually hold the French translation once it's done.
 34: 
 35: ## Creating and Sending a Task
 36: 
 37: How does a client (like your application, or another agent) actually create and send a Task to an agent server? It uses a specific command defined by the A2A protocol, usually called `tasks/send`.
 38: 
 39: Let's say our client found the "Translator Agent" from Chapter 1 and knows its `url` is `http://translator-agent.com/a2a`. The client wants to translate "hello".
 40: 
 41: Here's a simplified Python example of how the client might send this request:
 42: 
 43: ```python
 44: # File: samples/python/hosts/cli/cli_host.py (Conceptual Snippet)
 45: import requests
 46: import json
 47: import uuid # To generate unique IDs
 48: from common.types import TaskSendParams, Message, TextPart, Task
 49: 
 50: # Agent's communication endpoint (from Agent Card)
 51: agent_a2a_url = "http://translator-agent.com/a2a"
 52: 
 53: # 1. Prepare the Task request details
 54: task_id = str(uuid.uuid4()) # Generate a unique ID for this job
 55: user_message = Message(
 56:     role="user",
 57:     parts=[TextPart(text="Translate 'hello' to French")]
 58: )
 59: task_params = TaskSendParams(id=task_id, message=user_message)
 60: 
 61: # 2. Create the JSON-RPC request structure
 62: request_payload = {
 63:     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
 64:     "method": "tasks/send", # The command to send a task
 65:     "params": task_params.model_dump(exclude_none=True), # Our task details
 66:     "id": "req-1" # An ID for *this specific web request*
 67: }
 68: 
 69: # 3. Send the request to the agent's URL
 70: print(f"Sending task {task_id} to {agent_a2a_url}")
 71: response = requests.post(agent_a2a_url, json=request_payload)
 72: response.raise_for_status() # Check for HTTP errors
 73: 
 74: # 4. Process the response
 75: response_data = response.json()
 76: if response_data.get("result"):
 77:   # Agent accepted the task! It returns the initial Task object.
 78:   initial_task = Task(**response_data["result"])
 79:   print(f"Task created! ID: {initial_task.id}, State: {initial_task.status.state}")
 80: elif response_data.get("error"):
 81:   print(f"Error creating task: {response_data['error']}")
 82: 
 83: ```
 84: 
 85: **Explanation:**
 86: 
 87: 1.  **Prepare Details:** We generate a unique `task_id` and create the `Message` containing the text we want translated. These become the `params` for our request.
 88: 2.  **Build Request:** We wrap our `params` in a standard structure specifying the `method` (`tasks/send`) we want the agent to execute. (This structure is part of JSON-RPC, which is used by A2A - more on this in the [next chapter](03_a2a_protocol___core_types.md)).
 89: 3.  **Send:** We use the `requests` library to send this structure as JSON data via an HTTP POST request to the agent's A2A `url`.
 90: 4.  **Process Response:** The agent sends back a response. If successful, the `result` contains the newly created `Task` object, likely in the `submitted` state. We print its ID and initial state. If something went wrong, the `error` field will contain details.
 91: 
 92: **Example Output:**
 93: 
 94: ```
 95: Sending task a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890 to http://translator-agent.com/a2a
 96: Task created! ID: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890, State: submitted
 97: ```
 98: 
 99: Now the client knows the task was received and has its unique ID (`a1b2c3d4-...`). It can use this ID later to check the status or get the final result.
100: 
101: ## Task Lifecycle: States
102: 
103: A task doesn't just get created and instantly completed. It goes through different stages, represented by its `state` field. Here are the main states:
104: 
105: *   `submitted`: The agent has received the task request but hasn't started working on it yet.
106: *   `working`: The agent is actively processing the request (e.g., performing the translation).
107: *   `input-required`: (Optional) The agent needs more information from the client to continue. The client would then send another message using the same Task ID.
108: *   `completed`: The agent finished successfully. The results are available in the Task's `artifacts`.
109: *   `failed`: The agent encountered an error and could not complete the task.
110: *   `canceled`: The client (or agent) explicitly canceled the task before completion.
111: *   `unknown`: The state couldn't be determined.
112: 
113: These states allow the client to understand the progress of their request. For long-running tasks, the agent might even send updates as the state changes (we'll cover this in [Chapter 7: Streaming Communication (SSE)](07_streaming_communication__sse_.md)).
114: 
115: ## Under the Hood: How a Task is Handled
116: 
117: Let's trace what happens when the client sends that `tasks/send` request:
118: 
119: ```mermaid
120: sequenceDiagram
121:     participant C as Client App
122:     participant A as Agent Server (A2A Endpoint)
123:     participant TS as Task Store (e.g., Memory, DB)
124:     participant TL as Task Logic (e.g., Translator)
125: 
126:     C->>A: POST /a2a (JSON-RPC: method="tasks/send", params={id="T1", msg="Translate..."})
127:     Note right of A: Receives HTTP request, parses JSON-RPC
128: 
129:     A->>TS: Create/Find Task Record (ID: "T1")
130:     Note right of TS: Creates a new Task object in 'submitted' state
131:     TS-->>A: New Task Object (ID: "T1", state: "submitted")
132: 
133:     A-->>C: 200 OK (JSON-RPC: result={Task Object with state 'submitted'})
134:     Note left of C: Client receives confirmation Task is created
135: 
136:     Note over A,TL: Agent asynchronously starts processing...
137:     A->>TL: Start processing Task "T1" (Input: "Translate...")
138:     A->>TS: Update Task "T1" status to 'working'
139:     Note right of TS: Updates Task record state
140: 
141:     TL->>A: Processing finished (Output: "Bonjour")
142:     Note over A,TS: Agent updates Task with result and 'completed' state
143:     A->>TS: Update Task "T1" (state: 'completed', artifacts: ["Bonjour"])
144: 
145: ```
146: 
147: **Steps:**
148: 
149: 1.  **Client Sends Request:** The client sends the `tasks/send` JSON-RPC request via HTTP POST to the agent's A2A URL.
150: 2.  **Server Receives:** The agent server receives the request and understands it wants to start a task.
151: 3.  **Server Stores Task:** The server creates a new `Task` record (using something like the `InMemoryTaskStore` or `FileStore` shown in `samples/js/src/server/store.ts` or conceptually managed by `samples/python/common/server/task_manager.py`). It assigns the initial `submitted` state and stores the user's message.
152: 4.  **Server Responds:** The server immediately sends a response back to the client confirming the task was created, including the initial `Task` object.
153: 5.  **Server Processes (Async):** The server (likely in the background) triggers the actual work (e.g., calls its internal translation logic). It updates the task's state in the store to `working`.
154: 6.  **Server Completes:** Once the translation is done, the server updates the task's state to `completed` and adds the result ("Bonjour") as an `Artifact` in the task record within the store.
155: 
156: The client can later use the Task ID (`T1`) to fetch the updated Task object (using a different command like `tasks/get`) and retrieve the final translation from the `artifacts`.
157: 
158: ### Key Data Structures
159: 
160: The definition of these structures can be found in the protocol specification and helper libraries:
161: 
162: *   **Task:** (`samples/python/common/types.py:Task`, `samples/js/src/schema.ts:Task`) Holds the ID, status, artifacts, history, etc.
163: *   **Message:** (`samples/python/common/types.py:Message`, `samples/js/src/schema.ts:Message`) Represents a communication turn (user or agent) containing Parts.
164: *   **Part:** (`samples/python/common/types.py:Part`, `samples/js/src/schema.ts:Part`) The actual content (text, file, or structured data).
165: *   **Artifact:** (`samples/python/common/types.py:Artifact`, `samples/js/src/schema.ts:Artifact`) Output generated by the agent, also composed of Parts.
166: *   **TaskStatus:** (`samples/python/common/types.py:TaskStatus`, `samples/js/src/schema.ts:TaskStatus`) Contains the `TaskState` and timestamp.
167: 
168: ```typescript
169: // File: samples/js/src/schema.ts (Simplified Task Structure)
170: 
171: export interface Task {
172:   // Unique identifier for the task.
173:   id: string;
174:   // The current status of the task.
175:   status: TaskStatus;
176:   // Optional list of artifacts (outputs).
177:   artifacts?: Artifact[] | null;
178:   // (Optional) History of messages for this task
179:   // history?: Message[] | null;
180:   // ... other fields like sessionId, metadata
181: }
182: 
183: export interface TaskStatus {
184:   // The current state (e.g., "submitted", "working", "completed").
185:   state: TaskState;
186:   // Optional message associated with this status.
187:   message?: Message | null;
188:   // Timestamp of this status update.
189:   timestamp?: string;
190: }
191: 
192: // Example Artifact containing translated text
193: // artifact = { parts: [ { type: "text", text: "Bonjour le monde" } ] }
194: ```
195: 
196: This structure acts as the digital "work order" that travels between the client and the agent, carrying the request, tracking progress, and holding the final result.
197: 
198: ## Conclusion
199: 
200: The **Task** is the fundamental unit of work in the A2A protocol. It's how one agent asks another to do something. Think of it as a formal job request or work order that:
201: 
202: *   Contains the initial instructions (as a `Message`).
203: *   Has a unique ID for tracking.
204: *   Goes through different states (`submitted`, `working`, `completed`, etc.) to show progress.
205: *   Holds the final results (`Artifacts`).
206: 
207: By sending a `tasks/send` request, a client initiates a Task, and by checking the Task's status and artifacts later, the client gets the results.
208: 
209: Now that we understand the basic concepts of finding an agent ([Agent Card](01_agent_card.md)) and giving it work ([Task](02_task.md)), let's look closer at the communication rules and the specific data types used in the A2A protocol.

  8: # Chapter 3: A2A Protocol & Core Types
  9: 
 10: In the previous chapters, we learned how to find an agent using its [Agent Card](01_agent_card.md) and how to give it work using a [Task](02_task.md). Think of it like finding a specific workshop (Agent Card) and submitting a work order (Task).
 11: 
 12: But how do the client (who submits the order) and the agent (the workshop) actually *talk* to each other? What language do they use? If the client writes the order in English, but the workshop only understands Spanish, nothing will get done!
 13: 
 14: This chapter tackles that problem: **How do different AI agents, possibly built by different teams using different technologies, communicate reliably?**
 15: 
 16: The answer lies in the **A2A Protocol** and its **Core Types**.
 17: 
 18: ## What is a Protocol? The Rules of the Road
 19: 
 20: Imagine trying to drive in a country where you don't know the traffic rules. Do you drive on the left or right? What do the signs mean? It would be chaos! Traffic rules are a **protocol** – a shared set of rules everyone agrees on so things run smoothly.
 21: 
 22: Similarly, the **A2A Protocol** is the set of rules for how AI agents communicate. It defines:
 23: 
 24: 1.  **The Transport:** *How* messages physically travel (usually over the internet using standard HTTP requests, like your web browser uses).
 25: 2.  **The Format:** *What* the messages look like (the structure and language used).
 26: 3.  **The Actions:** *What* commands one agent can send to another (like "start a task" or "cancel a task").
 27: 
 28: Think of it as the **shared language** for AI agents. Just like humans use languages like English or Spanish, which have grammar (rules) and vocabulary (words), the A2A protocol provides the grammar and vocabulary for agents.
 29: 
 30: ## The Grammar: JSON-RPC 2.0
 31: 
 32: For the A2A protocol, the chosen "grammar" is a standard called **JSON-RPC 2.0**. Don't let the name scare you! It's just a simple way to structure messages using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation - a very common text format for data).
 33: 
 34: Here's the basic idea:
 35: 
 36: *   **Client sends a Request:** The client wanting the agent to do something sends a `Request` message.
 37: *   **Agent sends a Response:** The agent replies with a `Response` message.
 38: 
 39: A typical JSON-RPC Request looks like this:
 40: 
 41: ```json
 42: {
 43:   "jsonrpc": "2.0",        // Specifies the protocol version
 44:   "method": "some_action", // What the client wants the agent to DO
 45:   "params": { ... },       // The details needed for the action
 46:   "id": "request-123"      // A unique ID to match request and response
 47: }
 48: ```
 49: 
 50: **Explanation:**
 51: 
 52: *   `jsonrpc`: Always "2.0".
 53: *   `method`: The name of the command or function the client wants the agent to run (like `tasks/send` from Chapter 2).
 54: *   `params`: The input data needed for that command (like the text to translate). This can be an object `{}` or a list `[]`.
 55: *   `id`: A unique identifier the client makes up.
 56: 
 57: The agent then processes this request and sends back a Response matching that `id`:
 58: 
 59: **Success Response:**
 60: 
 61: ```json
 62: {
 63:   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
 64:   "result": { ... },      // The output/result of the action
 65:   "id": "request-123"     // The SAME ID as the request
 66: }
 67: ```
 68: 
 69: **Error Response:**
 70: 
 71: ```json
 72: {
 73:   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
 74:   "error": {             // Details about what went wrong
 75:     "code": -32601,
 76:     "message": "Method not found"
 77:   },
 78:   "id": "request-123"     // The SAME ID as the request (or null if error was severe)
 79: }
 80: ```
 81: 
 82: **Explanation:**
 83: 
 84: *   If the action worked, the response includes a `result` field containing the output.
 85: *   If something went wrong, it includes an `error` field with a numeric `code` and a descriptive `message`.
 86: *   Crucially, the `id` matches the request, so the client knows which request this response belongs to.
 87: 
 88: ```mermaid
 89: sequenceDiagram
 90:     participant C as Client App
 91:     participant A as Agent Server
 92: 
 93:     C->>A: JSON-RPC Request (id: "req-abc", method: "tasks/send", params: {...})
 94:     Note right of A: Agent parses JSON, finds method 'tasks/send'
 95: 
 96:     alt Action Successful
 97:         A-->>C: JSON-RPC Response (id: "req-abc", result: {Task Object})
 98:     else Action Failed
 99:         A-->>C: JSON-RPC Response (id: "req-abc", error: {code:..., message:...})
100:     end
101:     Note left of C: Client matches response 'id' to original request
102: ```
103: 
104: This simple request/response structure using JSON-RPC is the foundation of how A2A agents talk.
105: 
106: ## The Vocabulary: Core Data Types
107: 
108: If JSON-RPC is the grammar, then the **Core Types** are the standard vocabulary – the specific kinds of "words" or data structures used within the `params` and `result` fields. We've already seen some of these!
109: 
110: Let's recap the most important ones:
111: 
112: *   **`AgentCard`**: ([Chapter 1](01_agent_card.md)) The agent's profile. Describes its name, skills, and communication endpoint (`url`). Found in `/.well-known/agent.json`.
113:     *   Defined in: `samples/js/src/schema.ts:AgentCard`, `samples/python/common/types.py:AgentCard`
114: 
115: *   **`Task`**: ([Chapter 2](02_task.md)) The work order. Contains the unique `id`, current `status`, final `artifacts` (results), etc.
116:     *   Defined in: `samples/python/common/types.py:Task`, `samples/js/src/schema.ts:Task`
117: 
118: *   **`Message`**: Represents one turn in the conversation (either from the `user` or the `agent`). Contains one or more `Parts`.
119:     *   Defined in: `samples/python/common/types.py:Message`, `samples/js/src/schema.ts:Message`
120: 
121: *   **`Part`**: The actual content within a `Message` or `Artifact`. This is how we send different kinds of data:
122:     *   `TextPart`: For plain text.
123:     *   `FilePart`: For files (either included directly as encoded text (`bytes`) or as a link (`uri`)).
124:     *   `DataPart`: For structured JSON data (like filling out a form).
125:     *   Defined in: `samples/python/common/types.py:Part`, `samples/js/src/schema.ts:Part`
126: 
127: *   **`Artifact`**: Represents an output generated by the agent during a `Task`. It also contains `Parts`. For example, if a Task was "create a presentation about cats", an Artifact might be a `FilePart` containing the presentation file.
128:     *   Defined in: `samples/python/common/types.py:Artifact`, `samples/js/src/schema.ts:Artifact`
129: 
130: *   **`TaskStatus`**: Holds the current progress state of a `Task`. Includes the `state` itself and a `timestamp`.
131:     *   Defined in: `samples/python/common/types.py:TaskStatus`, `samples/js/src/schema.ts:TaskStatus`
132: 
133: *   **`TaskState`**: The specific state within `TaskStatus`. Common values are: `submitted`, `working`, `completed`, `failed`, `canceled`.
134:     *   Defined in: `samples/python/common/types.py:TaskState`, `samples/js/src/schema.ts:TaskState`
135: 
136: **Example: Building a `Message`**
137: 
138: Let's say the user wants to send the text "Translate 'hello' to French". This would be structured as a `Message` containing a `TextPart`:
139: 
140: ```json
141: // This structure would go inside the "params" of a tasks/send request
142: {
143:   "role": "user", // Who is sending this message
144:   "parts": [      // List of content parts (here, just one)
145:     {
146:       "type": "text", // Specifies this is a TextPart
147:       "text": "Translate 'hello' to French"
148:     }
149:   ]
150: }
151: ```
152: 
153: If the user also wanted to attach a document for translation, the `parts` list would have two items: a `TextPart` with instructions and a `FilePart` with the document.
154: 
155: ## Putting It Together: The `tasks/send` Example
156: 
157: Remember the `tasks/send` request from Chapter 2? Let's look at the full JSON-RPC structure that the client sends over HTTP:
158: 
159: ```json
160: // Client Sends This (HTTP POST body to Agent's URL)
161: {
162:   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
163:   "method": "tasks/send", // The action: start/continue a task
164:   "params": {            // The details (TaskSendParams structure)
165:     "id": "task-xyz-789", // Unique Task ID
166:     "message": {         // The user's message
167:       "role": "user",
168:       "parts": [
169:         {
170:           "type": "text",
171:           "text": "Translate 'hello' to French"
172:         }
173:       ]
174:     }
175:     // Other optional params like sessionId could go here
176:   },
177:   "id": "client-req-001" // Unique ID for *this specific request*
178: }
179: ```
180: 
181: If the agent accepts the task, it sends back a success response containing the initial `Task` object:
182: 
183: ```json
184: // Agent Sends This Back (HTTP Response body)
185: {
186:   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
187:   "result": {          // The result: a Task object
188:     "id": "task-xyz-789", // The same Task ID
189:     "status": {        // The initial status
190:       "state": "submitted",
191:       "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z"
192:     },
193:     "artifacts": null, // No results yet
194:     "history": null    // History might be omitted initially
195:     // Other Task fields
196:   },
197:   "id": "client-req-001" // Matches the request ID
198: }
199: ```
200: 
201: This exchange uses the JSON-RPC grammar (`method`, `params`, `result`, `id`) and the A2A vocabulary (`Task`, `Message`, `Part`, `TaskStatus`, `TaskState`) to communicate clearly.
202: 
203: ## Handling Mistakes: Errors in the Protocol
204: 
205: What if the client sends a request for a method the agent doesn't understand, like `tasks/make_coffee`? The agent would respond with a JSON-RPC error:
206: 
207: ```json
208: {
209:   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
210:   "error": {
211:     "code": -32601, // Standard JSON-RPC code for "Method not found"
212:     "message": "Method not found: tasks/make_coffee"
213:   },
214:   "id": "client-req-002"
215: }
216: ```
217: 
218: The A2A protocol also defines some specific error codes for common agent issues:
219: 
220: *   `-32001`: `Task Not Found` (e.g., client asks for status of a task ID that doesn't exist)
221: *   `-32002`: `Task Not Cancelable` (e.g., trying to cancel an already completed task)
222: *   `-32004`: `Unsupported Operation`
223: 
224: These standard errors help clients understand what went wrong in a predictable way. You can find definitions in the schema files:
225: 
226: *   `samples/js/src/schema.ts` (search for `ErrorCode`)
227: *   `samples/python/common/types.py` (search for error classes like `MethodNotFoundError`, `TaskNotFoundError`)
228: 
229: ## Conclusion
230: 
231: The A2A Protocol acts as the universal translator for AI agents. By defining:
232: 
233: 1.  A common **grammar** (JSON-RPC 2.0) for structuring requests and responses.
234: 2.  A standard **vocabulary** (Core Types like `Task`, `Message`, `Part`, `Artifact`) for the data being exchanged.
235: 
236: ...it allows agents built by anyone, using any framework, to communicate and collaborate effectively. It ensures that when one agent asks another to do something, the request is understood, progress can be tracked, and results can be returned in a predictable format.
237: 
238: Now that we understand the language agents speak, let's see how to build an agent that can actually listen and respond using this protocol.

  8: # Chapter 4: A2A Server Implementation
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](03_a2a_protocol___core_types.md), we learned the "language" and "grammar" that AI agents use to talk to each other – the **A2A Protocol** based on JSON-RPC and its **Core Types** like `Task` and `Message`. Think of it like learning the rules of diplomacy and the standard format for official documents.
 11: 
 12: But just knowing the rules isn't enough. If one country (an AI agent) wants to send a diplomatic message (a [Task](02_task.md)) to another, it needs an official reception point – an embassy. How does an AI agent set up its "embassy" to receive and handle these official A2A communications?
 13: 
 14: That's the role of the **A2A Server Implementation**. It solves the problem of **hosting an agent** and making it **accessible** according to the A2A protocol rules.
 15: 
 16: ## What is an A2A Server? The Agent's Embassy
 17: 
 18: Imagine our AI agent is like a skilled expert (a translator, a coder, an image generator) working inside a building. How do people from the outside world reach this expert and give them work? They can't just barge into the building!
 19: 
 20: They need to go through the official **reception desk** or **front office**. This office:
 21: 
 22: 1.  Listens for visitors (incoming requests).
 23: 2.  Understands the standard procedures for submitting work (the A2A protocol).
 24: 3.  Takes the request (the `Task`), logs it, and passes it to the right expert inside.
 25: 4.  Keeps track of the work's progress.
 26: 5.  Delivers the results back to the visitor when ready.
 27: 6.  Provides basic information about the building and its services (the [Agent Card](01_agent_card.md)).
 28: 
 29: An **A2A Server** is exactly like that front office or embassy for your AI agent. It's the software component that runs on a server, listens for incoming network requests, and acts as the official gateway for all A2A communication.
 30: 
 31: ## Why Do We Need It?
 32: 
 33: Without a server, our AI agent is isolated. It might be brilliant at its job, but no other agent or application can interact with it using the standard A2A protocol. The A2A Server provides the necessary "infrastructure" to:
 34: 
 35: *   **Listen:** Be constantly available on the network (at a specific URL) for incoming requests.
 36: *   **Understand:** Decode the JSON-RPC messages and figure out what the client wants (e.g., `tasks/send`, `tasks/get`).
 37: *   **Delegate:** Pass the work request (the `Task` details) to the actual AI logic (which might be implemented using tools like LangGraph, CrewAI, Genkit, or custom code).
 38: *   **Manage:** Keep track of ongoing `Tasks`, their current `status` (e.g., `submitted`, `working`, `completed`), and store their results (`Artifacts`).
 39: *   **Respond:** Send back properly formatted JSON-RPC responses (confirming task creation, providing results, or reporting errors).
 40: *   **Advertise:** Serve the agent's `agent.json` ([Agent Card](01_agent_card.md)) so others can discover it.
 41: 
 42: Think of it as the bridge connecting your agent's internal world to the external world of A2A communication.
 43: 
 44: ## Setting Up a Basic Server
 45: 
 46: Luckily, the `Google A2A` project provides helper libraries to make setting up a server much easier! You don't need to build the entire "embassy" from scratch. You mainly need to provide:
 47: 
 48: 1.  Your agent's specific logic (the "expert" who does the actual work).
 49: 2.  The agent's [Agent Card](01_agent_card.md) details.
 50: 
 51: Let's look at simplified examples in JavaScript (Node.js) and Python.
 52: 
 53: ### JavaScript Example (using `A2AServer` from the library)
 54: 
 55: Imagine we have a very simple "Echo Agent" that just sends back whatever text it receives.
 56: 
 57: ```typescript
 58: // File: simple-agent/index.ts (Conceptual Example)
 59: import { A2AServer, TaskContext, TaskYieldUpdate } from "google-a2a/server"; // Simplified import
 60: import * as schema from "google-a2a/schema";
 61: 
 62: // 1. Define the Agent's Logic (The "Expert")
 63: // This function handles a single task.
 64: async function* echoAgentLogic(
 65:   context: TaskContext
 66: ): AsyncGenerator<TaskYieldUpdate, schema.Task | void> {
 67:   const inputText = context.userMessage.parts[0].text ?? "No text found";
 68: 
 69:   // Yield a status update: "working"
 70:   yield { state: "working", message: { role: "agent", parts: [{ text: "Echoing..." }] } };
 71: 
 72:   // Yield the final result: "completed"
 73:   yield {
 74:     state: "completed",
 75:     message: { role: "agent", parts: [{ text: `You said: ${inputText}` }] }
 76:   };
 77:   // (Artifacts could also be yielded here if needed)
 78: }
 79: 
 80: // 2. Define the Agent Card
 81: const echoAgentCard: schema.AgentCard = {
 82:   name: "Echo Agent",
 83:   description: "Replies with the text it receives.",
 84:   url: "http://localhost:4000", // Where this server will run
 85:   version: "1.0",
 86:   capabilities: { streaming: true }, // It yields updates
 87:   skills: [{ id: "echo", name: "Echo Text" }],
 88:   // ... other card details
 89: };
 90: 
 91: // 3. Create and Start the Server
 92: const server = new A2AServer(echoAgentLogic, { card: echoAgentCard });
 93: server.start(4000); // Start listening on port 4000
 94: 
 95: console.log("Echo Agent server running on http://localhost:4000");
 96: ```
 97: 
 98: **Explanation:**
 99: 
100: 1.  **Agent Logic (`echoAgentLogic`):** This is the core function defining *what* the agent does. It receives the `TaskContext` (containing the user's message) and uses `yield` to send back status updates (`working`) and the final result (`completed`). We'll dive deeper into this logic in [Chapter 6: Task Handling Logic (Server-side)](06_task_handling_logic__server_side_.md). For now, just see it as the agent's brain.
101: 2.  **Agent Card (`echoAgentCard`):** We define the agent's public profile, including its name, description, and importantly, the `url` where the server will be listening.
102: 3.  **Server Setup:** We create an instance of `A2AServer`, passing our agent's logic function and its card. Then, we call `server.start()` to make it listen for requests on the specified port (4000).
103: 
104: That's it! With this code, we have a running A2A server ready to accept `tasks/send` requests for our Echo Agent.
105: 
106: ### Python Example (using `A2AServer` from the library)
107: 
108: Let's do the same for Python.
109: 
110: ```python
111: # File: simple_agent/main.py (Conceptual Example)
112: from common.server import A2AServer, TaskManager  # Simplified import
113: from common.types import (
114:     AgentCard, AgentCapabilities, AgentSkill,
115:     Task, TaskSendParams, TaskStatus, TaskState, Message, TextPart, SendTaskResponse
116: )
117: import logging
118: 
119: logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
120: logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
121: 
122: # 1. Define the Agent's Logic Handler (Task Manager)
123: # This class bridges the server and the agent's actual logic.
124: class EchoTaskManager(TaskManager): # Inherit from the base TaskManager
125:     async def on_send_task(self, params: TaskSendParams) -> SendTaskResponse:
126:         # Simulate processing the task
127:         input_text = params.message.parts[0].text if params.message.parts else "No text"
128:         logger.info(f"Echo Agent received: {input_text}")
129: 
130:         # Create the final Task object (simplified for non-streaming)
131:         final_task = Task(
132:             id=params.id,
133:             status=TaskStatus(
134:                 state=TaskState.COMPLETED,
135:                 message=Message(role="agent", parts=[TextPart(text=f"You said: {input_text}")])
136:             ),
137:             # ... other Task fields ...
138:         )
139:         # In a real scenario, you'd store/update the task state
140:         # self.tasks[params.id] = final_task # Example storage
141:         return SendTaskResponse(id=params.id, result=final_task)
142: 
143:     # Implement other abstract methods from TaskManager (get, cancel, etc.)
144:     # (Skipped for brevity in this example)
145:     async def on_get_task(self, request): raise NotImplementedError()
146:     async def on_cancel_task(self, request): raise NotImplementedError()
147:     # ... and so on for streaming, push notifications etc.
148: 
149: # 2. Define the Agent Card
150: echo_agent_card = AgentCard(
151:     name="Echo Agent",
152:     description="Replies with the text it receives.",
153:     url="http://localhost:5000/", # Where this server will run
154:     version="1.0",
155:     capabilities=AgentCapabilities(streaming=False), # Simplified non-streaming Python example
156:     skills=[AgentSkill(id="echo", name="Echo Text")],
157:     # ... other card details
158: )
159: 
160: # 3. Create and Start the Server
161: server = A2AServer(
162:     agent_card=echo_agent_card,
163:     task_manager=EchoTaskManager(), # Pass our task handler
164:     host="localhost",
165:     port=5000,
166: )
167: 
168: logger.info("Starting Echo Agent server on http://localhost:5000")
169: server.start()
170: ```
171: 
172: **Explanation:**
173: 
174: 1.  **Agent Logic Handler (`EchoTaskManager`):** In the Python library structure, we often create a class that inherits from `TaskManager`. This class implements methods like `on_send_task` to handle specific A2A commands. Here, `on_send_task` simulates processing and returns the final `Task` object wrapped in a `SendTaskResponse`. [Chapter 6](06_task_handling_logic__server_side_.md) will cover this in detail.
175: 2.  **Agent Card (`echo_agent_card`):** Similar to the JS example, we define the agent's profile.
176: 3.  **Server Setup:** We create an `A2AServer` instance, providing the card and our custom `EchoTaskManager`. We then call `server.start()`.
177: 
178: Both examples achieve the same goal: they use the library's `A2AServer` class to quickly stand up a web server that listens for A2A requests, delegates the work to the provided agent logic, and handles the communication details.
179: 
180: ## Under the Hood: How a Request is Processed
181: 
182: What happens when a client sends a `tasks/send` request to our running A2A server?
183: 
184: ```mermaid
185: sequenceDiagram
186:     participant C as Client App
187:     participant S as A2A Server (e.g., Express/Starlette)
188:     participant TM as Task Manager/Handler (Your Logic Bridge)
189:     participant AL as Agent Logic (e.g., echoAgentLogic, CrewAI)
190:     participant TS as Task Store (Memory/DB)
191: 
192:     C->>S: POST / (JSON-RPC: method="tasks/send", params={...})
193:     Note right of S: Receives HTTP POST, parses JSON-RPC
194: 
195:     S->>TM: Call on_send_task / Invoke Handler(params)
196:     Note right of TM: Validates parameters
197: 
198:     TM->>TS: Load/Create Task Record (ID: task-123)
199:     Note right of TS: Creates Task in 'submitted' state
200: 
201:     TM->>AL: Execute Agent Logic (Input: user message)
202:     Note right of AL: Performs the core work (e.g., echo)
203: 
204:     AL-->>TM: Returns result/Yields updates (e.g., "working", "completed")
205: 
206:     loop For each update/result
207:         TM->>TS: Update Task Record (ID: task-123, state: working/completed, artifacts: [...])
208:         Note right of TS: Saves the latest task state
209:         alt Streaming Response (SSE)
210:            S-->>C: SSE Event (data: {TaskStatusUpdateEvent/Artifact})
211:         end
212:     end
213: 
214:     alt Non-Streaming Response
215:         TM-->>S: Final Task object
216:         S-->>C: 200 OK (JSON-RPC: result={Final Task Object})
217:     else Streaming Response (SSE)
218:         Note over S,C: Stream ends after final event
219:     end
220: ```
221: 
222: **Steps:**
223: 
224: 1.  **Receive Request:** The client sends an HTTP POST request containing the JSON-RPC payload to the server's URL (e.g., `http://localhost:4000`). The web server part of the `A2AServer` (like Express in JS or Starlette in Python) receives this.
225: 2.  **Parse & Route:** The `A2AServer` parses the JSON body, validates it's a valid JSON-RPC request, and looks at the `method` field (e.g., `tasks/send`). Based on the method, it calls the appropriate handler function (like `handleTaskSend` in the JS server or delegates to the `on_send_task` method of the `TaskManager` in Python).
226: 3.  **Task Management:** The task handler (your `echoAgentLogic` or `EchoTaskManager`) takes over. It typically interacts with a `TaskStore` (like `InMemoryTaskStore`) to create or retrieve the [Task](02_task.md) record associated with the request's `taskId`. It updates the task's status to `submitted` or `working`.
227: 4.  **Execute Agent Logic:** The handler calls the actual underlying AI agent code, passing the necessary input (like the user's message).
228: 5.  **Process Results/Updates:** As the agent logic runs, it might produce results or status updates. The handler receives these.
229: 6.  **Update Store & Respond:** The handler updates the `Task` record in the `TaskStore` with the new status or results (`Artifacts`).
230:     *   For a simple request/response like `tasks/send` (non-streaming), it waits for the final result and sends back a single JSON-RPC response containing the completed `Task`.
231:     *   For a streaming request like `tasks/sendSubscribe`, it sends back Server-Sent Events (SSE) for each update as they happen. ([Chapter 7: Streaming Communication (SSE)](07_streaming_communication__sse_.md) covers this).
232: 7.  **Serve Agent Card:** Separately, if a client sends a GET request to `/.well-known/agent.json`, the `A2AServer` simply responds with the content of the `AgentCard` you provided during setup.
233: 
234: The `A2AServer` libraries (`samples/js/src/server/server.ts`, `samples/python/common/server/server.py`) handle the complexities of HTTP, JSON-RPC parsing, routing, and response formatting, letting you focus on implementing your agent's specific capabilities within the task handler ([Chapter 6](06_task_handling_logic__server_side_.md)).
235: 
236: ## Conclusion
237: 
238: The **A2A Server Implementation** is the crucial component that brings your AI agent to life on the network, acting as its official "embassy" for A2A communication. It listens for requests, understands the A2A protocol, manages tasks, interacts with your agent's core logic, and sends back responses.
239: 
240: By using the provided `A2AServer` libraries, you can quickly set up a compliant server without worrying about the low-level details of web servers and JSON-RPC, allowing you to concentrate on building your agent's unique skills.
241: 
242: Now that we know how to build the *server* side (the agent's embassy), how does another application or agent *talk* to it? We need to build an **A2A Client**.

  8: # Chapter 5: A2A Client Implementation
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](04_a2a_server_implementation.md), we learned how to build the "embassy" for our AI agent – the **A2A Server**. This server listens for incoming requests, acting as the official entry point for our agent according to the A2A protocol rules.
 11: 
 12: But how does someone actually *visit* this embassy and make a request? If you build a fantastic translation agent server, how does your chat application, or another AI agent, actually *use* it to translate text?
 13: 
 14: This chapter tackles that problem: **How do we build the component that *initiates* communication with an A2A agent server?**
 15: 
 16: This is the job of the **A2A Client Implementation**.
 17: 
 18: ## What is an A2A Client? The Agent's Customer
 19: 
 20: Think about how you use the web:
 21: 
 22: *   You want to visit a website (like `google.com`).
 23: *   You open your **web browser** (like Chrome or Firefox).
 24: *   You type the website's address into the browser.
 25: *   The browser sends a request to the website's server.
 26: *   The server sends back the webpage content.
 27: *   Your browser receives the content and displays it to you.
 28: 
 29: In this scenario, your **web browser** is the **client**. It *starts* the conversation, knows how to format the request (using HTTP), sends it to the right address, and understands the server's response.
 30: 
 31: Similarly, an **A2A Client** is the software component that acts like that web browser, but specifically for talking to A2A agents:
 32: 
 33: 1.  **Knows the Agent's Address:** It needs the URL of the agent's A2A server (which it might get from the agent's [Agent Card](01_agent_card.md)).
 34: 2.  **Speaks the Language:** It knows how to format requests according to the [A2A Protocol & Core Types](03_a2a_protocol___core_types.md), using JSON-RPC for commands like `tasks/send`.
 35: 3.  **Initiates the Call:** It sends these requests over the network (usually via HTTP POST) to the agent's server.
 36: 4.  **Understands the Reply:** It receives the server's JSON-RPC response, checks for success or errors, and parses the results (like the initial `Task` object or streaming updates).
 37: 
 38: Essentially, the A2A Client is the part of your application (or another agent) that *consumes* the services offered by an A2A agent server.
 39: 
 40: ## Why Do We Need It?
 41: 
 42: Your application's core logic (e.g., the chat interface, the document summarizer UI) shouldn't need to worry about the messy details of JSON-RPC formatting, HTTP headers, or handling network connections.
 43: 
 44: The A2A Client acts as an **intermediary** or **adapter**. It provides a cleaner, simpler way for your application code to interact with a remote A2A agent. Your application can just say, "Client, please send this message to the agent," and the client handles all the protocol details.
 45: 
 46: ## Using an A2A Client Library
 47: 
 48: Just like we used `A2AServer` libraries to simplify building the server in [Chapter 4](04_a2a_server_implementation.md), the `Google A2A` project provides `A2AClient` libraries to make building the client side easier.
 49: 
 50: Let's see how we might use these libraries in JavaScript and Python to talk to the "Echo Agent" server we discussed previously.
 51: 
 52: ### JavaScript Example (using `A2AClient` from the library)
 53: 
 54: Imagine we're building a simple command-line tool (`cli.ts`) that lets a user chat with our Echo Agent running at `http://localhost:4000`.
 55: 
 56: ```typescript
 57: // File: samples/js/src/cli.ts (Simplified Snippet)
 58: import { A2AClient } from "./client/client.js"; // The client library
 59: import { TaskSendParams } from "./schema.js"; // Types for request parameters
 60: import crypto from "node:crypto"; // To generate IDs
 61: 
 62: // Agent's address (replace with your agent's URL)
 63: const serverUrl = "http://localhost:4000";
 64: 
 65: // 1. Create a client instance pointing to the agent's server
 66: const client = new A2AClient(serverUrl);
 67: 
 68: // User input from the command line
 69: const userInput = "Hello Echo Agent!";
 70: 
 71: // 2. Prepare the parameters for the 'tasks/sendSubscribe' request
 72: const taskId = crypto.randomUUID(); // Generate a unique ID for this task
 73: const params: TaskSendParams = {
 74:   id: taskId,
 75:   message: {
 76:     role: "user",
 77:     parts: [{ type: "text", text: userInput }], // The user's message
 78:   },
 79: };
 80: 
 81: // 3. Send the request and handle the streaming response
 82: async function sendMessage() {
 83:   console.log(`Sending task ${taskId} to ${serverUrl}...`);
 84:   try {
 85:     // Use sendTaskSubscribe for agents that support streaming
 86:     const stream = client.sendTaskSubscribe(params);
 87: 
 88:     // Loop through the events received from the server
 89:     for await (const event of stream) {
 90:       console.log("Received Agent Event:", event);
 91:       // (In a real app, you'd parse 'event' which could be
 92:       // TaskStatusUpdateEvent or TaskArtifactUpdateEvent)
 93:     }
 94:     console.log("Agent stream finished.");
 95: 
 96:   } catch (error: any) {
 97:     console.error("Error talking to agent:", error.message || error);
 98:   }
 99: }
100: 
101: sendMessage();
102: ```
103: 
104: **Explanation:**
105: 
106: 1.  **Create Client:** We import `A2AClient` and create an instance, telling it the URL of the agent server we want to talk to.
107: 2.  **Prepare Request:** We gather the necessary information for our request: a unique `taskId` and the `message` containing the user's input, formatted according to the A2A `TaskSendParams` structure ([Chapter 3](03_a2a_protocol___core_types.md)).
108: 3.  **Send & Handle Stream:** We call `client.sendTaskSubscribe(params)`. This method handles formatting the JSON-RPC request, sending the HTTP POST, and processing the Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream from the server ([Chapter 7: Streaming Communication (SSE)](07_streaming_communication__sse_.md)). We use a `for await...of` loop to process each event as it arrives from the agent.
109: 
110: **Example Output (Conceptual):**
111: 
112: ```
113: Sending task abc-123 to http://localhost:4000...
114: Received Agent Event: { status: { state: 'working', message: { role: 'agent', parts: [ { text: 'Echoing...' } ] } } }
115: Received Agent Event: { status: { state: 'completed', message: { role: 'agent', parts: [ { text: 'You said: Hello Echo Agent!' } ] } } }
116: Agent stream finished.
117: ```
118: 
119: The client library takes care of the underlying network communication and event parsing.
120: 
121: ### Python Example (using `A2AClient` from the library)
122: 
123: Let's create a similar command-line tool in Python (`cli/__main__.py`) talking to an agent at `http://localhost:5000`.
124: 
125: ```python
126: # File: samples/python/hosts/cli/__main__.py (Simplified Snippet)
127: import asyncio
128: from uuid import uuid4
129: from common.client import A2AClient # The client library
130: # Assume 'card' is the AgentCard fetched previously (see Chapter 1)
131: # card = A2ACardResolver("http://localhost:5000").get_agent_card()
132: 
133: # 1. Create a client instance using the agent's card or URL
134: # client = A2AClient(agent_card=card)
135: client = A2AClient(url="http://localhost:5000") # Or directly use URL
136: 
137: # User input
138: user_input = "Hi Python Agent!"
139: 
140: # 2. Prepare the payload (parameters) for the request
141: task_id = uuid4().hex # Generate a unique Task ID
142: payload = {
143:     "id": task_id,
144:     "message": {
145:         "role": "user",
146:         "parts": [{"type": "text", "text": user_input}],
147:     },
148: }
149: 
150: # 3. Send the request and handle the response
151: async def send_message():
152:     print(f"Sending task {task_id} to {client.url}...")
153:     try:
154:         # Use send_task_streaming if agent supports it (check card.capabilities.streaming)
155:         # Assuming streaming is supported here:
156:         response_stream = client.send_task_streaming(payload)
157:         async for result in response_stream:
158:              # result is already parsed SendTaskStreamingResponse object
159:             print(f"Received Agent Event: {result.model_dump_json(exclude_none=True)}")
160: 
161:         print("Agent stream finished.")
162: 
163:         # If NOT streaming, you'd use send_task:
164:         # task_result = await client.send_task(payload)
165:         # print(f"Received Agent Response: {task_result.model_dump_json(exclude_none=True)}")
166: 
167:     except Exception as e:
168:         print(f"Error talking to agent: {e}")
169: 
170: asyncio.run(send_message())
171: ```
172: 
173: **Explanation:**
174: 
175: 1.  **Create Client:** We import `A2AClient` and create an instance, providing the agent's `url`.
176: 2.  **Prepare Payload:** We create a Python dictionary `payload` containing the `id` and `message` parameters for the `tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe` method.
177: 3.  **Send & Handle Stream:** We call `client.send_task_streaming(payload)`. Similar to the JS version, this handles the JSON-RPC formatting, HTTP POST, and returns an asynchronous iterator. We loop through it using `async for` to get parsed response objects (like `SendTaskStreamingResponse`) for each event. The library hides the complexity of parsing the SSE stream. If the agent didn't support streaming, we would call `client.send_task(payload)` instead, which would return the final `Task` object directly after the agent finishes.
178: 
179: **Example Output (Conceptual, streaming):**
180: 
181: ```
182: Sending task def-456 to http://localhost:5000...
183: Received Agent Event: {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": {"status": {"state": "working", "message": {"role": "agent", "parts": [{"type": "text", "text": "Echoing..."}]}}}}
184: Received Agent Event: {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": {"status": {"state": "completed", "message": {"role": "agent", "parts": [{"type": "text", "text": "You said: Hi Python Agent!"}]}}}}
185: Agent stream finished.
186: ```
187: 
188: In both examples, the `A2AClient` library provides a high-level interface (`sendTaskSubscribe`, `send_task_streaming`, `sendTask`, `send_task`) that simplifies the process of communicating with an A2A server.
189: 
190: ## Under the Hood: How the Client Works
191: 
192: What's happening inside the `A2AClient` library when you call a method like `sendTaskSubscribe`?
193: 
194: ```mermaid
195: sequenceDiagram
196:     participant App as Your Application (e.g., CLI)
197:     participant Lib as A2AClient Library
198:     participant Net as Network (HTTP)
199:     participant Srv as A2A Agent Server
200: 
201:     App->>Lib: Call client.sendTaskSubscribe(params)

205: 
206:     Lib->>Net: Send HTTP POST Request to Agent URL
207:     Note over Net,Srv: Request travels over the internet
208: 
209:     Net->>Srv: Delivers HTTP POST Request
210:     Note right of Srv: Server receives request, parses JSON-RPC
211: 
212:     Srv->>Srv: Processes Task (Starts internal logic)
213:     Note right of Srv: Switches to streaming mode (SSE)
214: 
215:     Srv-->>Net: Send HTTP Response (Status 200 OK, Content-Type: text/event-stream)
216:     Srv-->>Net: Send SSE Event 1 (e.g., 'working' status)
217:     Srv-->>Net: Send SSE Event 2 (e.g., 'completed' status)
218:     Note right of Srv: Stream ends
219: 
220:     Net-->>Lib: Delivers HTTP Response & SSE Events
221:     Note right of Lib: Receives streaming response
222: 
223:     Lib->>Lib: Parse SSE Events (Extract JSON data from 'data:' lines)
224:     Lib-->>App: Yield Parsed Event 1 (as object)
225:     Lib-->>App: Yield Parsed Event 2 (as object)
226:     Note left of App: Application processes each event in the loop
227: 
228:     App->>App: Loop finishes when stream ends
229: ```
230: 
231: **Steps:**
232: 
233: 1.  **Application Call:** Your code calls a method on the `A2AClient` instance (e.g., `sendTaskSubscribe`).
234: 2.  **Format Request:** The library takes your parameters (`params`), generates a unique request ID, and constructs the full JSON-RPC request payload (a JSON object).
235: 3.  **Send HTTP Request:** The library uses an underlying HTTP client (like `fetch` in browsers/Node.js or `httpx` in Python) to send an HTTP POST request to the agent server's URL. It sets the correct headers (`Content-Type: application/json`, `Accept: text/event-stream` for streaming).
236: 4.  **Server Processing:** The A2A server receives the request, processes it (as described in [Chapter 4](04_a2a_server_implementation.md)), and starts sending back a response. For streaming, this is an HTTP response with a `text/event-stream` content type, followed by individual Server-Sent Events (SSE).
237: 5.  **Receive Response:** The client library's HTTP client receives the response.
238: 6.  **Parse Response/Stream:**
239:     *   **Non-streaming (`sendTask`):** It waits for the full response, parses the JSON body, checks for JSON-RPC level errors, and extracts the `result` field (e.g., the final `Task` object).
240:     *   **Streaming (`sendTaskSubscribe`):** It processes the incoming SSE stream, parsing the `data:` lines from each event, converting the JSON text into objects, and yielding these objects back to your application code via the async iterator.
241: 7.  **Return/Yield Result:** The library returns the parsed result (for non-streaming) or yields the parsed events (for streaming) to your application code.
242: 
243: The client libraries (like `samples/js/src/client/client.ts` and `samples/python/common/client/client.py`) contain internal helper functions (e.g., `_makeHttpRequest`, `_handleJsonResponse`, `_handleStreamingResponse` in the JS client; `_send_request` in the Python client) to manage these steps.
244: 
245: ## Conclusion
246: 
247: The **A2A Client** is the component that *initiates* conversations with A2A agent servers. It acts on behalf of your application or another agent, translating simple method calls (like "send this message") into correctly formatted A2A protocol requests (JSON-RPC over HTTP).
248: 
249: It handles the complexities of:
250: 
251: *   Knowing the agent's address (`url`).
252: *   Formatting requests (`tasks/send`, `tasks/sendSubscribe`).
253: *   Sending them over the network.
254: *   Parsing responses (JSON results or streaming SSE events).
255: *   Handling errors.
256: 
257: By using the provided `A2AClient` libraries, you can easily integrate A2A communication into your applications without needing deep knowledge of the underlying protocol mechanics. You create a client, prepare your data, and call the appropriate method.
258: 
259: Now that we've seen both the server ([Chapter 4](04_a2a_server_implementation.md)) and the client side of the A2A interaction, let's dive deeper into how the *server* actually processes the tasks it receives from the client.

  8: # Chapter 6: Task Handling Logic (Server-side)
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 5: A2A Client Implementation](05_a2a_client_implementation.md), we learned how to build the "customer" side – the **A2A Client** – that sends requests to an agent's server. We saw how it formats messages and talks to the agent's "embassy" ([A2A Server Implementation](04_a2a_server_implementation.md)).
 11: 
 12: But what happens *inside* the embassy once a request arrives? Who actually reads the request, does the work, and prepares the response?
 13: 
 14: This chapter focuses on the **Task Handling Logic**. It solves the problem: **What is the core "brain" inside the A2A Server that performs the requested work?**
 15: 
 16: ## The Agent's "Brain" - The Chef in the Kitchen
 17: 
 18: Imagine our A2A Server ([Chapter 4](04_a2a_server_implementation.md)) is like a restaurant's front desk. It takes orders ([Tasks](02_task.md)) from customers ([A2A Clients](05_a2a_client_implementation.md)) using the standard A2A language ([A2A Protocol & Core Types](03_a2a_protocol___core_types.md)).
 19: 
 20: But the front desk doesn't cook the food! It passes the order to the **kitchen**, where the **chef** takes over. The chef:
 21: 
 22: 1.  **Reads the Order:** Understands what the customer wants (e.g., "Translate 'hello' to French").
 23: 2.  **Prepares the Dish:** Uses ingredients (data), tools (APIs, databases), and expertise (AI models like Gemini) to fulfill the request.
 24: 3.  **Updates the Waiter:** Might send updates back like "Order is being prepared" (`working` state).
 25: 4.  **Finishes the Dish:** Creates the final product (the translated text "Bonjour le monde").
 26: 5.  **Plates the Dish:** Packages the result (`Artifacts`) and signals completion (`completed` state).
 27: 
 28: The **Task Handling Logic** is the "chef" inside your A2A Server. It's the core piece of code that contains the agent's specific skills and business logic.
 29: 
 30: ## What Does the Task Handler Do?
 31: 
 32: When the A2A Server receives a request like `tasks/send`, it hands off the details to the Task Handling Logic. This logic is responsible for:
 33: 
 34: *   **Understanding the Request:** Receiving the user's `Message` and any other context associated with the `Task`.
 35: *   **Executing the Work:**
 36:     *   Calling AI models (like Gemini via libraries like Genkit) for generation, analysis, etc.
 37:     *   Using tools (like calling a weather API, searching a database, or using specific libraries like CrewAI or LangGraph).
 38:     *   Performing custom calculations or data manipulation.
 39: *   **Managing State:** Signaling progress by updating the `Task`'s status (e.g., changing from `submitted` to `working`).
 40: *   **Generating Output:** Creating the final results (`Artifacts`) or intermediate updates.
 41: *   **Handling Errors:** Reporting back if something goes wrong (`failed` state).
 42: 
 43: ## Implementing the "Brain"
 44: 
 45: The `Google A2A` libraries provide structures to help you implement this logic. Let's look at simplified examples.
 46: 
 47: ### JavaScript Example (Async Generator Handler)
 48: 
 49: In JavaScript, the task handler is often an `async function*` (an asynchronous generator). It receives `TaskContext` and uses `yield` to send back updates.
 50: 
 51: Imagine a simple agent that pretends to call an AI to greet the user.
 52: 
 53: ```typescript
 54: // File: samples/js/src/server/handler.ts (Conceptual Example of a Handler)
 55: import * as schema from "../schema.js"; // For types like Task, Message, etc.
 56: import { TaskContext, TaskYieldUpdate } from "./handler.js"; // Handler types
 57: 
 58: // The Task Handling Logic for our 'Greeter Agent'
 59: async function* greeterAgentHandler(
 60:   context: TaskContext
 61: ): AsyncGenerator<TaskYieldUpdate> { // It yields updates
 62: 
 63:   // 1. Get the user's name from the input message
 64:   const userMessageText = context.userMessage.parts[0].text ?? "there";
 65:   const userName = userMessageText.split(" ").pop(); // Simple extraction
 66: 
 67:   // 2. Signal that work is starting
 68:   console.log(`[GreeterAgent] Task ${context.task.id}: Starting`);
 69:   yield {
 70:     state: "working", // Update status to 'working'
 71:     message: { role: "agent", parts: [{ text: "Thinking..." }] }
 72:   };
 73: 
 74:   // 3. Simulate calling an AI (the "chef" uses an "ingredient")
 75:   await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // Pretend work
 76:   const greeting = `Hello, ${userName}! Welcome.`;
 77: 
 78:   // 4. Signal completion and provide the final message
 79:   console.log(`[GreeterAgent] Task ${context.task.id}: Completing`);
 80:   yield {
 81:     state: "completed", // Update status to 'completed'
 82:     message: { role: "agent", parts: [{ text: greeting }] }
 83:   };
 84:   // For more complex results, we could yield Artifacts here too.
 85: }
 86: 
 87: // This handler function (`greeterAgentHandler`) would be passed
 88: // to the A2AServer constructor, like in Chapter 4.
 89: // const server = new A2AServer(greeterAgentHandler, { card: greeterAgentCard });
 90: ```
 91: 
 92: **Explanation:**
 93: 
 94: 1.  **Input:** The function receives `context` which contains the current `task` and the `userMessage`. We extract the user's name.
 95: 2.  **Signal Working:** It `yield`s an update object setting the `state` to `working` and providing an optional status message. The A2A Server receives this yield.
 96: 3.  **Do Work:** It simulates calling an AI to generate a greeting. In real agents (like `samples/js/src/agents/coder/index.ts` or `samples/js/src/agents/movie-agent/index.ts`), this is where you'd interact with Genkit, external APIs, or other tools.
 97: 4.  **Signal Completion:** It `yield`s the final update, setting the `state` to `completed` and including the greeting in the agent's `message`.
 98: 
 99: ### Python Example (TaskManager with Streaming)
100: 
101: In Python, you typically subclass `TaskManager` and implement methods like `on_send_task` or `on_send_task_subscribe`. For streaming responses, `on_send_task_subscribe` can also be an async generator.
102: 
103: Let's create a similar Greeter Agent.
104: 
105: ```python
106: # File: my_agent/task_manager.py (Conceptual Example)
107: import asyncio
108: from typing import Union, AsyncIterable
109: from common.server.task_manager import InMemoryTaskManager # Base class
110: from common.types import (
111:     Task, TaskSendParams, TaskStatus, TaskState, Message, TextPart,
112:     SendTaskStreamingRequest, SendTaskStreamingResponse, TaskStatusUpdateEvent,
113:     JSONRPCResponse
114: )
115: import logging
116: 
117: logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
118: 
119: class GreeterTaskManager(InMemoryTaskManager): # Inherit from base
120: 
121:     # Handle non-streaming requests (optional)
122:     async def on_send_task(self, request):
123:         # ... implementation for non-streaming ...
124:         raise NotImplementedError()
125: 
126:     # Handle STREAMING requests using an async generator
127:     async def on_send_task_subscribe(
128:         self, request: SendTaskStreamingRequest
129:     ) -> Union[AsyncIterable[SendTaskStreamingResponse], JSONRPCResponse]:
130: 
131:         task_params: TaskSendParams = request.params
132:         task_id = task_params.id
133:         logger.info(f"[GreeterAgent] Task {task_id}: Received")
134: 
135:         # 0. Set up internal queue for SSE events
136:         # (Handled by library/base class, conceptually)

174:                 await self.update_store(task_id, failed_status, artifacts=None)
175: 
176:         # Return the async generator
177:         return _process_task()
178: 
179: # This GreeterTaskManager class would be passed to the A2AServer
180: # server = A2AServer(task_manager=GreeterTaskManager(), ...)
181: ```
182: 
183: **Explanation:**
184: 
185: 1.  **Inheritance:** We create `GreeterTaskManager` inheriting from `InMemoryTaskManager` (which provides basic task storage).
186: 2.  **`on_send_task_subscribe`:** This method handles streaming requests. It first stores the initial task details.
187: 3.  **Async Generator (`_process_task`):** The core logic is inside an inner `async def` that returns an `AsyncIterable`. This allows us to `yield` updates over time, similar to the JavaScript generator.
188: 4.  **Yielding Events:** Instead of yielding raw status updates, we yield `SendTaskStreamingResponse` objects containing `TaskStatusUpdateEvent`. The `final=True` flag marks the last event. ([Chapter 7: Streaming Communication (SSE)](07_streaming_communication__sse_.md) covers SSE in detail).
189: 5.  **Updating Store:** We explicitly call `self.update_store` after yielding events to keep the task's state consistent in our `InMemoryTaskManager`.
190: 6.  **Error Handling:** A `try...except` block handles potential errors and yields a `failed` state event.
191: 
192: Real-world Python agents might use frameworks like CrewAI (`samples/python/agents/crewai/agent.py`) or LangGraph (`samples/python/agents/langgraph/agent.py`) within these handler methods to orchestrate more complex logic.
193: 
194: ## Key Inputs to the Handler
195: 
196: The handler needs information to do its job. The context typically includes:
197: 
198: *   **Task Details:** The current `Task` object, including its unique `id`, current `status`, and any `metadata`.
199: *   **User Message:** The specific `Message` from the user that triggered this work (containing `Parts` like text or files).
200: *   **History (Optional):** Previous `Messages` exchanged within this `Task` for conversational context.
201: *   **Cancellation Check:** A way to see if the client has requested to cancel the task.
202: 
203: These inputs are bundled in `TaskContext` (JS) or passed as parameters to the `TaskManager` methods (Python).
204: 
205: ## Signaling Progress and Delivering Results
206: 
207: *   **Status Updates:** Yielding status changes (`working`, `input-required`, `completed`, `failed`) keeps the client informed, especially for long-running tasks. This often includes a `Message` from the agent (e.g., "Looking up information...", "Please provide the city name.").
208: *   **Artifacts (Results):** For tasks that produce distinct outputs (like files, structured data, or images), the handler yields `Artifact` objects. These artifacts are collected and associated with the `Task`.
209:     *   JS: Yield `schema.Artifact` objects directly. (`samples/js/src/agents/coder/index.ts`)
210:     *   Python (Streaming): Yield `SendTaskStreamingResponse` containing `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent`. (`demo/ui/service/server/adk_host_manager.py` shows `process_artifact_event`)
211: 
212: ## Connecting to the Server
213: 
214: As shown in [Chapter 4](04_a2a_server_implementation.md), you connect your Task Handling Logic to the `A2AServer` during its setup:
215: 
216: *   **JS:** Pass the async generator function (`greeterAgentHandler`) to the `A2AServer` constructor.
217: *   **Python:** Pass an instance of your `TaskManager` subclass (`GreeterTaskManager()`) to the `A2AServer` constructor.
218: 
219: The server then knows exactly which "chef" to call when an order comes in.
220: 
221: ## Under the Hood: Server Invoking the Handler
222: 
223: Let's visualize how the server uses the handler when a streaming `tasks/sendSubscribe` request arrives:
224: 
225: ```mermaid
226: sequenceDiagram
227:     participant C as A2A Client
228:     participant S as A2A Server
229:     participant TH as Task Handler (e.g., greeterAgentHandler)
230:     participant AI as AI Model/Tool (Optional)
231:     participant TS as Task Store
232: 
233:     C->>S: POST / (JSON-RPC: method="tasks/sendSubscribe", params={...})
234:     Note right of S: Receives request, parses JSON-RPC
235: 
236:     S->>TS: Create/Get Task Record (ID: task-123)
237:     TS-->>S: Task Object (state: submitted)
238: 
239:     S->>TH: Invoke handler(context) / Call on_send_task_subscribe()
240:     Note right of TH: Handler starts executing
241: 
242:     TH->>TS: Update Task (state: working)
243:     TH-->>S: yield {state: "working", ...} / yield TaskStatusUpdateEvent(working)
244:     Note right of S: Receives yielded update
245: 
246:     S-->>C: Send SSE Event (data: TaskStatusUpdateEvent - working)
247:     Note left of C: Client receives 'working' status
248: 
249:     alt Handler needs AI/Tool
250:         TH->>AI: Request generation("greet user")
251:         AI-->>TH: Response ("Hello there!")
252:     end
253: 
254:     TH->>TS: Update Task (state: completed, message: "Hello...")
255:     TH-->>S: yield {state: "completed", ...} / yield TaskStatusUpdateEvent(completed, final=True)
256:     Note right of S: Receives final yielded update
257: 
258:     S-->>C: Send SSE Event (data: TaskStatusUpdateEvent - completed, final=True)
259:     Note left of C: Client receives 'completed' status, stream ends
260: ```
261: 
262: **Steps:**
263: 
264: 1.  **Request In:** The `A2A Server` receives the `tasks/sendSubscribe` request.
265: 2.  **Task Prep:** It looks up or creates the `Task` in the `Task Store`.
266: 3.  **Invoke Handler:** It calls your registered Task Handling Logic (e.g., `greeterAgentHandler` or `GreeterTaskManager.on_send_task_subscribe`), providing the necessary context.
267: 4.  **Handler Executes & Yields:** Your handler runs. When it `yield`s a status update (like `working`):
268:     *   It might update the `Task Store`.
269:     *   It returns the update to the `A2AServer`.
270: 5.  **Server Sends Update:** The `A2AServer` formats the update as a Server-Sent Event (SSE) and sends it to the `A2A Client`.
271: 6.  **(Optional) External Calls:** The handler might call external services (AI, tools).
272: 7.  **Handler Yields Final Result:** When the handler is done, it `yield`s the final `completed` (or `failed`) status update (often marked as `final=True` in streaming).
273: 8.  **Server Sends Final Update:** The `A2AServer` sends the final SSE event to the client, closing the stream.
274: 
275: Key files involved:
276: 
277: *   **JS Handler Definition:** `samples/js/src/server/handler.ts` (defines `TaskContext`, `TaskYieldUpdate`, `TaskHandler`)
278: *   **JS Agent Example:** `samples/js/src/agents/coder/index.ts`, `samples/js/src/agents/movie-agent/index.ts`
279: *   **Python Base Manager:** `samples/python/common/server/task_manager.py` (defines `TaskManager`, `InMemoryTaskManager`)
280: *   **Python Agent Examples:** `samples/python/agents/crewai/agent.py`, `samples/python/agents/langgraph/agent.py`, `demo/ui/service/server/adk_host_manager.py` (more complex, uses ADK)
281: 
282: ## Conclusion
283: 
284: The **Task Handling Logic** is the heart of your A2A agent – the "chef" that actually does the work. It receives requests via the `A2AServer`, interacts with AI models or tools, manages the task's state transitions, and generates the final response or intermediate updates.
285: 
286: By implementing this logic (often as an async generator in JS or a `TaskManager` subclass in Python) and connecting it to your server, you define your agent's unique capabilities and how it fulfills the tasks requested by clients.
287: 
288: We saw how handlers can `yield` updates. But how do these updates actually get sent back to the client in real-time? Let's dive into the mechanism used for that: Streaming Communication using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

  8: # Chapter 7: Streaming Communication (SSE)
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](06_task_handling_logic__server_side_.md), we built the "brain" of our agent – the **Task Handling Logic**. We saw how this logic can `yield` status updates or partial results as it works on a task. That's great, but how do those updates actually get back to the client in real-time? If the agent is writing a long story, how does the user see it paragraph by paragraph instead of waiting minutes for the whole thing?
 11: 
 12: This chapter dives into **Streaming Communication** using **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**. It solves the problem: **How can the server send real-time updates to the client for tasks that take time?**
 13: 
 14: ## The Problem: Waiting is Boring!
 15: 
 16: Imagine you ask your AI agent assistant to plan a detailed weekend trip to a new city. This involves looking up flights, hotels, attractions, restaurants, checking opening times, maybe even booking things. This could take a minute or two!
 17: 
 18: If the communication was just a simple request and response, your application would send the request "Plan my trip" and then... wait. And wait. And wait. Finally, after two minutes, it would get the complete plan back. That's not a very engaging experience! You'd wonder if it was even working.
 19: 
 20: Wouldn't it be better if the agent could send updates like:
 21: 
 22: *   "Okay, planning your trip to Paris..."
 23: *   "Found potential flights..."
 24: *   "Checking hotel availability near the Eiffel Tower..."
 25: *   "Here's a draft itinerary..."
 26: *   "Okay, the final plan is ready!"
 27: 
 28: This way, the user sees progress and knows the agent is actively working.
 29: 
 30: ## The Solution: Streaming with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
 31: 
 32: This real-time update mechanism is called **streaming**. Instead of one big response at the end, the server *streams* multiple small messages back to the client over a single connection.
 33: 
 34: The Google A2A protocol uses a standard web technology called **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to achieve this.
 35: 
 36: **Analogy: Package Tracking**
 37: 
 38: Think about ordering a package online:
 39: 
 40: *   **Regular Request/Response:** You place the order, and the *only* update you get is when the package finally arrives at your door.
 41: *   **Streaming (SSE):** You place the order, and you get *live updates*: "Order confirmed," "Package shipped," "Out for delivery," "Delivered."
 42: 
 43: SSE works like that live tracking. The client makes one request, and the server keeps that connection open, pushing updates (events) whenever something new happens.
 44: 
 45: **Key points about SSE:**
 46: 
 47: *   **Server Pushes:** The server sends data to the client whenever it wants (after the initial connection).
 48: *   **One-Way:** Data primarily flows from Server -> Client.
 49: *   **Standard Web Tech:** It's built on top of regular HTTP.
 50: 
 51: ## How Streaming Works in A2A
 52: 
 53: 1.  **Client Initiates:** The [A2A Client](05_a2a_client_implementation.md) uses a specific JSON-RPC method: `tasks/sendSubscribe` (instead of the regular `tasks/send`). This tells the server, "I want to start this task, AND I want to receive live updates."
 54: 2.  **Server Acknowledges:** The [A2A Server](04_a2a_server_implementation.md) receives the `tasks/sendSubscribe` request. It prepares to handle a streaming response.
 55: 3.  **Special Response Header:** The server sends back an initial HTTP response with a special header: `Content-Type: text/event-stream`. This tells the client, "Get ready for a stream of events!" The connection stays open.
 56: 4.  **Handler Yields:** Inside the server, the [Task Handling Logic](06_task_handling_logic__server_side_.md) (the async generator) starts working. When it `yield`s a status update (like `state: 'working'`) or an artifact:
 57:     *   The `A2AServer` library catches this yielded value.
 58: 5.  **Server Sends Event:** The `A2AServer` formats the yielded data into an SSE message (more on the format later) and sends it down the open connection to the client.
 59: 6.  **Repeat:** Steps 4 and 5 repeat every time the handler yields something new.
 60: 7.  **Stream Ends:** When the handler finishes (or yields a final state like `completed` or `failed`), the server sends a final event (often marked with `final: true`) and then closes the connection.
 61: 
 62: ## Server-Side: Sending the Stream
 63: 
 64: Let's peek at how the `A2AServer` library handles yielded values from your task handler ([Chapter 6](06_task_handling_logic__server_side_.md)) to send SSE events.
 65: 
 66: ### JavaScript Example (Conceptual)
 67: 
 68: The `A2AServer` in `samples/js/src/server/server.ts` uses the underlying Express.js response object (`res`) to write SSE messages.
 69: 
 70: ```typescript
 71: // File: samples/js/src/server/server.ts (Simplified Snippet inside handleTaskSendSubscribe)
 72: 
 73: // --- Setup SSE ---
 74: res.writeHead(200, {
 75:   "Content-Type": "text/event-stream", // Tell client it's SSE
 76:   "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
 77:   "Connection": "keep-alive",
 78: });
 79: 
 80: // Function to send a single SSE event
 81: const sendEvent = (eventData: schema.JSONRPCResponse) => {
 82:   // Format: "data: <json string>\n\n"
 83:   res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify(eventData)}\n\n`);
 84: };
 85: 
 86: // --- Process generator yields ---
 87: for await (const yieldValue of generator) {
 88:   // ... (Apply update, save to store etc. - see Chapter 6) ...
 89: 
 90:   // Create the JSON payload (TaskStatusUpdateEvent or TaskArtifactUpdateEvent)
 91:   const eventPayload = createEventFromYield(taskId, yieldValue, isFinal);
 92: 
 93:   // Wrap payload in a JSON-RPC Response structure
 94:   const rpcResponse = createSuccessResponse(req.id, eventPayload);
 95: 
 96:   // Send the formatted event down the stream
 97:   sendEvent(rpcResponse);
 98: 
 99:   if (isFinal) break; // Stop if handler yielded a final state
100: }
101: 
102: // --- End Stream ---
103: if (!res.writableEnded) {
104:   res.end(); // Close the connection
105: }
106: ```
107: 
108: **Explanation:**
109: 
110: 1.  **Headers:** The server first sends HTTP headers to establish the SSE connection (`Content-Type: text/event-stream`).
111: 2.  **`sendEvent` Helper:** A function is defined to format the JSON data correctly (`data: ...\n\n`) and write it to the response stream (`res.write`).
112: 3.  **Looping:** The code loops through the values yielded by your `TaskHandler` generator.
113: 4.  **Formatting:** Each yielded value is turned into a standard A2A event payload (`TaskStatusUpdateEvent` or `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent`) wrapped in a JSON-RPC response structure.
114: 5.  **Sending:** `sendEvent` is called to push the formatted message to the client.
115: 6.  **Closing:** Once the loop finishes (or a final event is sent), `res.end()` closes the connection.
116: 
117: ### Python Example (Conceptual)
118: 
119: The Python `A2AServer` in `samples/python/common/server/server.py` uses the `sse-starlette` library and `EventSourceResponse` to handle the streaming.
120: 
121: ```python
122: # File: samples/python/common/server/server.py (Simplified Snippet _create_response)
123: from sse_starlette.sse import EventSourceResponse
124: from typing import AsyncIterable
125: 
126: # ... inside _process_request ...
127: result = await self.task_manager.on_send_task_subscribe(json_rpc_request)
128: return self._create_response(result) # Pass the generator to _create_response
129: 
130: # ... inside A2AServer ...
131: def _create_response(self, result: Any) -> JSONResponse | EventSourceResponse:
132:     if isinstance(result, AsyncIterable):
133:         # If the handler returned an async generator...
134: 
135:         async def event_generator(generator_result) -> AsyncIterable[dict[str, str]]:
136:             # Wrap the generator to format SSE messages
137:             async for item in generator_result:
138:                 # item is expected to be a JSONRPCResponse containing the event payload
139:                 yield {"data": item.model_dump_json(exclude_none=True)}
140: 
141:         # Use EventSourceResponse to handle the streaming
142:         return EventSourceResponse(event_generator(result))
143:     # ... (handle non-streaming JSONResponse) ...
144: ```
145: 
146: **Explanation:**
147: 
148: 1.  **Generator:** The `on_send_task_subscribe` method in your `TaskManager` ([Chapter 6](06_task_handling_logic__server_side_.md)) returns an `AsyncIterable` (an async generator).
149: 2.  **`EventSourceResponse`:** The `A2AServer` detects this generator and wraps it in `EventSourceResponse`.
150: 3.  **Formatting:** The inner `event_generator` function iterates through the items yielded by your handler (which are already formatted as `SendTaskStreamingResponse` objects containing the event payload). It takes each item, converts it to a JSON string, and yields it in the `{"data": ...}` format expected by `EventSourceResponse`.
151: 4.  **Automatic Streaming:** `EventSourceResponse` automatically handles sending the correct SSE headers and writing each yielded `data` chunk to the client over the open connection.
152: 
153: In both cases, the library handles the details of SSE formatting, letting your `TaskHandler` focus just on yielding the updates.
154: 
155: ## Client-Side: Receiving the Stream
156: 
157: How does the `A2AClient` handle these incoming events?
158: 
159: ### JavaScript Example (Conceptual)
160: 
161: The `A2AClient` in `samples/js/src/client/client.ts` uses the browser's `fetch` API and `ReadableStream` to process the SSE events.
162: 
163: ```typescript
164: // File: samples/js/src/client/client.ts (Simplified Snippet inside _handleStreamingResponse)
165: 
166: async function* _handleStreamingResponse(response: Response): AsyncIterable<any> {
167:   if (!response.ok || !response.body) {
168:     // Handle HTTP errors before trying to stream
169:     throw new Error(`HTTP error ${response.status}`);
170:   }
171: 
172:   // Get a reader for the response body stream (decoded as text)
173:   const reader = response.body
174:     .pipeThrough(new TextDecoderStream())
175:     .getReader();
176:   let buffer = ""; // To handle partial messages
177: 
178:   try {
179:     while (true) {
180:       const { done, value } = await reader.read(); // Read next chunk
181: 
182:       if (done) break; // Stream finished
183: 
184:       buffer += value; // Add chunk to buffer
185:       const lines = buffer.split("\n\n"); // Split into potential messages
186:       buffer = lines.pop() || ""; // Keep any trailing partial message
187: 
188:       for (const message of lines) {
189:         if (message.startsWith("data: ")) { // Check for SSE data line
190:           const dataLine = message.substring("data: ".length);
191:           try {
192:             // Parse the JSON data from the line
193:             const parsedData = JSON.parse(dataLine);
194:             // parsedData is expected to be a JSONRPCResponse
195:             if (parsedData.result) {
196:               // Yield the actual event payload (TaskStatusUpdateEvent, etc.)
197:               yield parsedData.result;
198:             } else if (parsedData.error) {
199:               // Handle errors received in the stream
200:               throw new RpcError(parsedData.error.code, parsedData.error.message);
201:             }
202:           } catch (e) {
203:             console.error("Failed to parse SSE data:", dataLine, e);
204:           }
205:         }
206:       }
207:     }
208:   } finally {
209:     reader.releaseLock(); // Clean up the reader
210:   }
211: }

213: // Usage (from Chapter 5):
214: // const stream = client.sendTaskSubscribe(params);
215: // for await (const event of stream) {
216: //   console.log("Received Agent Event:", event);
217: // }
218: ```
219: 
220: **Explanation:**
221: 
222: 1.  **Reader:** It gets a `ReadableStreamDefaultReader` to read the response body chunk by chunk.
223: 2.  **Buffering:** It uses a `buffer` to accumulate incoming text, because SSE messages (`data: ...\n\n`) might arrive split across multiple network packets.
224: 3.  **Splitting Messages:** It splits the buffer by the SSE message separator (`\n\n`).
225: 4.  **Parsing `data:`:** It looks for lines starting with `data: `, extracts the JSON string after it, and parses it.
226: 5.  **Yielding Payload:** It extracts the `result` field from the parsed JSON-RPC response (this `result` contains the `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` or `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent`) and `yield`s it to the application code (the `for await...of` loop).
227: 6.  **Error Handling:** It includes checks for HTTP errors and JSON parsing errors.
228: 
229: ### Python Example (Conceptual)
230: 
231: The Python `A2AClient` in `samples/python/common/client/client.py` uses the `httpx-sse` library.
232: 
233: ```python
234: # File: samples/python/common/client/client.py (Simplified Snippet send_task_streaming)
235: import httpx
236: from httpx_sse import connect_sse # SSE client library
237: import json
238: 
239: async def send_task_streaming(self, payload: dict) -> AsyncIterable[SendTaskStreamingResponse]:
240:     request = SendTaskStreamingRequest(params=payload)
241:     request_json = request.model_dump(exclude_none=True)
242: 
243:     # Use httpx client and connect_sse context manager
244:     async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=None) as client:
245:       try:
246:         async with connect_sse(client, "POST", self.url, json=request_json) as event_source:
247:             # Iterate through Server-Sent Events provided by the library
248:             async for sse in event_source.aiter_sse():
249:                 if sse.event == "message": # Default event type
250:                     try:
251:                         # Parse the JSON data from the event
252:                         response_data = json.loads(sse.data)
253:                         # Validate and yield the parsed response object
254:                         yield SendTaskStreamingResponse(**response_data)
255:                     except json.JSONDecodeError:
256:                         print(f"Warning: Could not decode SSE data: {sse.data}")
257:                     except Exception as e: # Catch validation errors too
258:                         print(f"Warning: Error processing SSE data: {e} - Data: {sse.data}")
259:       except httpx.RequestError as e:
260:           raise A2AClientHTTPError(400, str(e)) from e
261:       # Handle other potential errors like connection issues
262: ```
263: 
264: **Explanation:**
265: 
266: 1.  **`httpx-sse`:** It uses the `connect_sse` function from `httpx-sse`. This function handles the underlying HTTP connection and SSE parsing.
267: 2.  **Iteration:** `event_source.aiter_sse()` provides an async iterator that yields individual SSE events as they arrive.
268: 3.  **Parsing:** Inside the loop, `sse.data` contains the JSON string from the `data:` line. We parse it using `json.loads()`.
269: 4.  **Validation & Yield:** We validate the parsed data against the `SendTaskStreamingResponse` model (which expects the `result` to be an event payload) and `yield` the resulting object to the application code (`async for result in response_stream:`).
270: 5.  **Error Handling:** Includes `try...except` blocks for JSON decoding errors and HTTP request errors.
271: 
272: Again, the client libraries hide most of the complexity, providing a simple async iterator for your application to consume.
273: 
274: ## Under the Hood: The SSE Sequence
275: 
276: Here's how the pieces fit together when a client requests streaming:
277: 
278: ```mermaid
279: sequenceDiagram
280:     participant App as Client Application
281:     participant ClientLib as A2AClient Library
282:     participant Network as HTTP/SSE
283:     participant ServerLib as A2AServer Library
284:     participant Handler as Task Handler (Agent Logic)
285: 
286:     App->>ClientLib: Call client.sendTaskSubscribe(params)
287:     ClientLib->>Network: POST /a2a (JSON-RPC: method="tasks/sendSubscribe", Accept: text/event-stream)
288:     Network->>ServerLib: Deliver POST request
289: 
290:     ServerLib->>ServerLib: Receive request, See 'sendSubscribe'
291:     ServerLib->>Network: Respond HTTP 200 OK (Content-Type: text/event-stream)
292:     ServerLib->>Handler: Invoke handler(context)
293: 
294:     Network->>ClientLib: Deliver HTTP 200 OK (stream headers)

296: 
297:     Handler->>Handler: Start processing...

299:

301:     ServerLib->>Network: Send SSE event (data: {"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":"req-1", "result":{...working...}}\n\n)
302: 
303:     Network->>ClientLib: Deliver SSE event
304:     ClientLib->>ClientLib: Parse 'data:' line, extract 'result' payload
305:     ClientLib-->>App: yield TaskStatusUpdateEvent (working)
306: 
307:     Handler->>Handler: Generate partial result...
308:     Handler-->>ServerLib: yield Artifact(...)
309: 
310:     ServerLib->>ServerLib: Format update as JSONRPCResponse(result=TaskArtifactUpdateEvent)
311:     ServerLib->>Network: Send SSE event (data: {"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":"req-1", "result":{...artifact...}}\n\n)
312: 
313:     Network->>ClientLib: Deliver SSE event
314:     ClientLib->>ClientLib: Parse 'data:' line, extract 'result' payload
315:     ClientLib-->>App: yield TaskArtifactUpdateEvent (artifact)
316: 
317:     Handler->>Handler: Finish processing...
318:     Handler-->>ServerLib: yield {state: "completed"}
319: 
320:     ServerLib->>ServerLib: Format update (final=true) as JSONRPCResponse(result=TaskStatusUpdateEvent)
321:     ServerLib->>Network: Send SSE event (data: {"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":"req-1", "result":{...completed, final:true}}\n\n)
322:     ServerLib->>Network: Close connection
323: 
324:     Network->>ClientLib: Deliver SSE event
325:     ClientLib->>ClientLib: Parse 'data:' line, extract 'result' payload
326:     ClientLib-->>App: yield TaskStatusUpdateEvent (completed)
327:     ClientLib->>ClientLib: Detect stream end
328:     App->>App: Async loop finishes
329: ```
330: 
331: ## SSE Event Format in A2A
332: 
333: The basic format of an SSE message is:
334: 
335: ```
336: data: <payload_as_json_string>
337: 
338: ```
339: 
340: (Note the two newlines at the end!)
341: 
342: In the A2A protocol, the `<payload_as_json_string>` is typically a standard JSON-RPC `Response` object. The `result` field of this response object contains the actual A2A event payload:
343: 
344: *   **`TaskStatusUpdateEvent`:** Sent when the task's status changes (e.g., `submitted` -> `working`). Includes the new `TaskStatus`.
345: *   **`TaskArtifactUpdateEvent`:** Sent when the task generates an output `Artifact` (like a chunk of text, a file reference, or structured data).
346: 
347: **Example Status Update Event (as sent over SSE):**
348: 
349: ```
350: data: {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": "req-client-123", "result": {"id": "task-abc", "status": {"state": "working", "message": {"role": "agent", "parts": [{"text": "Analyzing data..."}]}, "timestamp": "..." }, "final": false}}
351: 
352: ```
353: 
354: **Example Artifact Update Event (as sent over SSE):**
355: 
356: ```
357: data: {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": "req-client-123", "result": {"id": "task-abc", "artifact": {"parts": [{"text": "Here is the first paragraph..."}]}, "final": false}}
358: 
359: ```
360: 
361: The `final: true` flag is added to the *last* event sent for a task (usually a final `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` with state `completed` or `failed`) to signal the end of the stream.
362: 
363: ## Conclusion
364: 
365: Streaming Communication using Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a powerful feature of the A2A protocol that allows agents to provide real-time feedback for long-running tasks.
366: 
367: *   It improves user experience by showing progress instead of making users wait.
368: *   It uses the standard SSE web technology (`Content-Type: text/event-stream`).
369: *   Clients initiate streaming using `tasks/sendSubscribe`.
370: *   Servers use libraries (like `sse-starlette` or custom Express logic) to send `data:` events containing JSON-RPC responses with `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` or `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent` payloads.
371: *   Clients use libraries (like `httpx-sse` or `fetch` streams) to easily consume these events.
372: 
373: Now that we understand how individual agents can communicate, even for long tasks, how can we coordinate *multiple* agents to work together on a larger goal?

  8: # Chapter 8: Multi-Agent Orchestration (Host Agent)
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](07_streaming_communication__sse_.md), we saw how an agent server can stream updates back to a client using Server-Sent Events (SSE). This is great for keeping users informed during long tasks.
 11: 
 12: But what if a task is *so* complex that no single AI agent can handle it alone? Imagine asking an assistant: "Plan a weekend trip to London for me, including flights from New York, a hotel near the British Museum, and suggest two vegetarian restaurants."
 13: 
 14: One agent might be amazing at finding flights, another specialized in hotel bookings, and a third brilliant at restaurant recommendations. How can we get these specialist agents to work together to fulfill your complex request?
 15: 
 16: This chapter introduces the concept of **Multi-Agent Orchestration** using a **Host Agent**. It solves the problem: **How can we coordinate multiple, specialized AI agents to achieve a larger goal?**
 17: 
 18: ## What is a Host Agent? The Project Manager AI
 19: 
 20: Think of a big project, like building a house. You don't just talk to one person. You have a **project manager** (or general contractor). They:
 21: 
 22: 1.  Receive the high-level goal (build a house).
 23: 2.  Understand the different skills needed (plumbing, electrical, framing, etc.).
 24: 3.  Find and hire specialists (plumbers, electricians, carpenters).
 25: 4.  Assign specific tasks to each specialist.
 26: 5.  Coordinate their work and deadlines.
 27: 6.  Combine their contributions into the final house.
 28: 
 29: A **Host Agent** in the A2A world acts exactly like that project manager. It's an AI agent whose main job is *not* to perform tasks itself, but to **coordinate other agents**. Specifically, it acts as an **[A2A Client](05_a2a_client_implementation.md)** to *other* downstream A2A agents.
 30: 
 31: Here's the flow:
 32: 
 33: 1.  **Receives Request:** The Host Agent gets a request from a user or application (e.g., "Plan my London trip").
 34: 2.  **Finds Specialists:** It looks at its list of known downstream agents and their [Agent Cards](01_agent_card.md) to see who has the needed skills (e.g., "Flight Booker Agent", "Hotel Finder Agent").
 35: 3.  **Delegates Tasks:** It breaks down the request and sends specific [Tasks](02_task.md) to the chosen downstream agents using the standard [A2A Protocol & Core Types](03_a2a_protocol___core_types.md). For example:
 36:     *   Sends a task "Find NYC-London flights for next weekend" to the Flight Booker Agent.
 37:     *   Sends a task "Find hotels near British Museum" to the Hotel Finder Agent.
 38: 4.  **Gathers Results:** It receives the results (potentially via [Streaming Communication (SSE)](07_streaming_communication__sse_.md)) from the downstream agents.
 39: 5.  **Combines & Responds:** It might combine the flight info and hotel options into a single, coherent response for the original user.
 40: 
 41: The Host Agent is the central coordinator, making multiple agents appear as one unified, more capable agent.
 42: 
 43: ## How a Host Agent Works (Conceptual)
 44: 
 45: Let's imagine we're building a simple Host Agent. It knows about two other agents:
 46: 
 47: *   `Joke Teller Agent` (at `http://joke-agent.com`) - Skill: `tell_joke`
 48: *   `Summarizer Agent` (at `http://summary-agent.com`) - Skill: `summarize_text`
 49: 
 50: Our Host Agent receives the request: "Tell me a joke and summarize this article: [long article text]"
 51: 
 52: Here's how the Host Agent's internal logic might work:
 53: 
 54: 1.  **Analyze Request:** The Host Agent realizes the request has two parts: telling a joke and summarizing text.
 55: 2.  **Match Skills:**
 56:     *   It checks its known agents' [Agent Cards](01_agent_card.md).
 57:     *   It sees `Joke Teller Agent` has the `tell_joke` skill.
 58:     *   It sees `Summarizer Agent` has the `summarize_text` skill.
 59: 3.  **Delegate Task 1 (Joke):**
 60:     *   It acts as an [A2A Client](05_a2a_client_implementation.md).
 61:     *   It sends a `tasks/send` request to `http://joke-agent.com/a2a` with the message "Tell me a joke".
 62: 4.  **Delegate Task 2 (Summary):**
 63:     *   It acts as an [A2A Client](05_a2a_client_implementation.md) again.
 64:     *   It sends a `tasks/send` request to `http://summary-agent.com/a2a` with the message containing the article text.
 65: 5.  **Await Responses:** It waits for both downstream tasks to complete (using their Task IDs to track them). Let's say it gets:
 66:     *   From Joke Agent: "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"
 67:     *   From Summarizer Agent: "[Short summary of the article]"
 68: 6.  **Combine & Reply:** It combines these results into a single response for the original user: "Okay, here's a joke: Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything! \n\nAnd here's the summary: [Short summary of the article]"
 69: 
 70: ## Example Implementation Snippets (Conceptual Python)
 71: 
 72: Building a full Host Agent often involves frameworks like Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), as seen in `samples/python/hosts/multiagent/host_agent.py`. However, let's look at the core A2A concepts conceptually.
 73: 
 74: The Host Agent needs a way to manage connections to downstream agents. We might have a helper class like `RemoteAgentConnection` (inspired by `samples/python/hosts/multiagent/remote_agent_connection.py`) which internally uses an [A2A Client](05_a2a_client_implementation.md).
 75: 
 76: ```python
 77: # Conceptual Helper Class (Manages client for one downstream agent)
 78: from common.client import A2AClient
 79: from common.types import AgentCard, TaskSendParams, Task
 80: 
 81: class RemoteAgentConnection:
 82:     def __init__(self, agent_card: AgentCard):
 83:         # Store the downstream agent's card
 84:         self.card = agent_card
 85:         # Create an A2A client specifically for this agent
 86:         self.client = A2AClient(agent_card=agent_card)
 87:         print(f"Connection ready for agent: {self.card.name}")
 88: 
 89:     async def send_task_to_remote(self, params: TaskSendParams) -> Task:
 90:         print(f"Host sending task {params.id} to {self.card.name}...")
 91:         # Use the internal A2A client to send the task
 92:         # (Simplified: assumes non-streaming for clarity)
 93:         response = await self.client.send_task(params.model_dump())
 94:         print(f"Host received response for task {params.id} from {self.card.name}")
 95:         return response.result # Return the final Task object
 96: ```
 97: 
 98: **Explanation:**
 99: 
100: *   This class holds the [Agent Card](01_agent_card.md) of a downstream agent.
101: *   It creates and holds an [A2A Client](05_a2a_client_implementation.md) instance configured to talk to that specific agent's A2A server URL.
102: *   The `send_task_to_remote` method takes the task details (`TaskSendParams`) and uses the internal client to actually send the [Task](02_task.md) over A2A.
103: 
104: Now, the Host Agent's main logic might look something like this:
105: 
106: ```python
107: # Conceptual Host Agent Logic
108: import asyncio
109: from common.types import Message, TextPart, TaskSendParams

119:         self.remote_connections = {
120:             "Joke Agent": RemoteAgentConnection(joke_agent_card),
121:             "Summarizer Agent": RemoteAgentConnection(summary_agent_card),
122:         }

151:         print(f"Host dispatching {len(tasks_to_run)} tasks...")
152:         results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks_to_run)
153:         print("Host gathered results from downstream agents.")
154: 
155:         # Combine results (simplified)
156:         final_response = ""
157:         for task_result in results:
158:             if task_result.status.message and task_result.status.message.parts:
159:                 final_response += task_result.status.message.parts[0].text + "\n"
160: 
161:         print(f"Host final response: {final_response}")
162:         return final_response

173: 1.  **Initialization:** The `HostAgentLogic` creates `RemoteAgentConnection` instances for each downstream agent it knows.
174: 2.  **Request Handling:** When `handle_user_request` is called, it figures out which downstream agents are needed based on the request text (very basic keyword matching here).
175: 3.  **Prepare Tasks:** It prepares the `TaskSendParams` for each required downstream task.
176: 4.  **Concurrent Delegation:** It uses `asyncio.gather` to run the `send_task_to_remote` calls for all needed agents *concurrently*. This means it doesn't wait for the joke agent to finish before asking the summarizer agent to start.
177: 5.  **Combine Results:** After `asyncio.gather` finishes (meaning all downstream tasks have completed), it extracts the results from the returned `Task` objects and combines them into a final response.
178: 
179: This example shows the core idea: the Host Agent uses its knowledge of other agents' capabilities and acts as an A2A client to delegate work, potentially in parallel. Real host agents would have much more sophisticated logic for planning, delegation, and result synthesis, possibly using large language models themselves for coordination.
180: 
181: ## Under the Hood: Orchestration Flow
182: 
183: Let's trace the communication for our "Joke & Summarize" example:
184: 
185: ```mermaid
186: sequenceDiagram
187:     participant User
188:     participant Host as Host Agent (Server)
189:     participant HAClient as Host Agent (Internal A2A Client)
190:     participant Joke as Joke Agent (Server)
191:     participant Summary as Summarizer Agent (Server)
192: 
193:     User->>Host: Send Task T0: "Tell joke & summarize..."
194:     Note over Host: Analyzes request, needs Joke & Summarizer
195: 
196:     Host->>HAClient: Initiate A2A Task T1 to Joke Agent ("Tell joke")
197:     HAClient->>Joke: POST /a2a (tasks/send, id=T1, msg="Tell joke")
198:     Note right of Joke: Joke Agent starts processing T1
199: 
200:     Host->>HAClient: Initiate A2A Task T2 to Summarizer Agent ("Summarize text...")
201:     HAClient->>Summary: POST /a2a (tasks/send, id=T2, msg="...")
202:     Note right of Summary: Summarizer Agent starts processing T2
203: 
204:     Joke-->>HAClient: 200 OK (JSON-RPC result: Task T1 object, state=completed, result="Why..?")
205:     HAClient-->>Host: Received result for T1
206: 
207:     Summary-->>HAClient: 200 OK (JSON-RPC result: Task T2 object, state=completed, result="[Summary...]")
208:     HAClient-->>Host: Received result for T2
209: 
210:     Note over Host: Combines results from T1 and T2
211:     Host-->>User: Respond Task T0 (state=completed, result="Joke: ... Summary: ...")
212: ```
213: 
214: **Steps:**
215: 
216: 1.  User sends the initial request (Task T0) to the Host Agent.
217: 2.  The Host Agent's logic determines it needs both the Joke Agent and Summarizer Agent.
218: 3.  The Host Agent uses its internal A2A client capabilities (represented by `HAClient`) to send Task T1 to the Joke Agent's A2A server endpoint.
219: 4.  Concurrently (or sequentially), the Host Agent uses its client capabilities to send Task T2 to the Summarizer Agent's A2A server endpoint.
220: 5.  The downstream agents (Joke, Summary) process their respective tasks and send back A2A responses (containing the final Task object with results) to the Host Agent's client component.
221: 6.  The Host Agent logic receives the results for T1 and T2.
222: 7.  The Host Agent combines the results and sends the final response for the original Task T0 back to the user.
223: 
224: The key is that the Host Agent speaks A2A *both* as a server (to the original user) and as a client (to the downstream agents).
225: 
226: **Relevant Files:**
227: 
228: *   `samples/python/hosts/multiagent/host_agent.py`: Implements the host agent logic, deciding which tools (remote agents) to call.
229: *   `samples/python/hosts/multiagent/remote_agent_connection.py`: Wraps the `A2AClient` for easier use by the `HostAgent`. It handles sending the task via A2A (streaming or non-streaming).
230: *   `demo/ui/service/server/adk_host_manager.py`: Manages the lifecycle and state of the host agent within the demo application framework (using Google ADK). It shows how task callbacks from `RemoteAgentConnection` update the overall state.
231: 
232: ## Conclusion
233: 
234: Multi-Agent Orchestration allows us to combine the strengths of specialized AI agents to tackle complex problems that a single agent might struggle with.
235: 
236: The **Host Agent** acts as the "project manager" in this system. It:
237: 
238: *   Understands the overall goal.
239: *   Knows the capabilities of other available agents (via their [Agent Cards](01_agent_card.md)).
240: *   Delegates sub-tasks to appropriate downstream agents by acting as an [A2A Client](05_a2a_client_implementation.md).
241: *   Coordinates the process and potentially combines the results.
242: 
243: This pattern enables building sophisticated applications by composing modular, specialized agents that communicate using the standard A2A protocol.
244: 
245: Now that we've explored the core concepts and components of the A2A protocol, let's see how they all come together in a practical demonstration.

  8: # Chapter 9: Demo UI Application & Service
  9: 
 10: In the [previous chapter](08_multi_agent_orchestration__host_agent_.md), we explored how a **Host Agent** can act like a project manager, coordinating multiple specialized agents using the A2A protocol to achieve complex goals. We've learned about Agent Cards, Tasks, the protocol itself, servers, clients, task logic, streaming, and orchestration. That's a lot of building blocks!
 11: 
 12: But how do we see all these pieces working together in a real, interactive way? Just reading about protocols and servers is like reading the blueprints for a car. Wouldn't it be more helpful to actually *see* the car drive?
 13: 
 14: That's where the **Demo UI Application & Service** comes in. It solves the problem: **How can we visualize and interact with the A2A protocol and multi-agent systems in action?**
 15: 
 16: ## What is the Demo UI Application & Service? The Control Room
 17: 
 18: Imagine a space mission control room. You have:
 19: 
 20: *   **Big Screens (UI):** Showing the rocket's status, communication logs, astronaut locations, etc.
 21: *   **Flight Controllers (Backend Service):** People at consoles managing specific parts of the mission, talking to different teams, and updating the screens.
 22: *   **Astronauts & Ground Crew (A2A Agents):** The actual experts doing the work (flying, repairing, analyzing), communicating back via radio (A2A protocol).
 23: 
 24: The **Demo UI Application & Service** is like that control room for our A2A agents:
 25: 
 26: 1.  **Demo UI Application:** This is the web-based frontend, built using a Python framework called [Mesop](https://github.com/mesop-dev/mesop). It provides the "big screens" – a chat interface where you can talk to agents, see their responses (including special content like forms or images), view lists of available agents, and inspect the communication flow.
 27: 2.  **Backend Service (`ConversationServer`):** This is the "flight controller" software running behind the scenes. It's a backend web service (built using FastAPI in Python) that the UI application talks to. It's *not* the main [Host Agent](08_multi_agent_orchestration__host_agent_.md) itself, but rather an **intermediary**. It manages the user's conversations, receives events from the UI (like sending a message), communicates with the actual agent logic (like the Host Agent), and sends state updates back to the UI so the screens stay current.
 28: 
 29: Think of it as a user-friendly window into the world of A2A, letting you watch and participate as agents collaborate.
 30: 
 31: ## Key Components
 32: 
 33: Let's break down the two main parts:
 34: 
 35: ### 1. Frontend (Mesop UI Application)
 36: 
 37: This is what you see and interact with in your web browser. Mesop allows building UIs purely in Python. Key features include:
 38: 
 39: *   **Chat Interface:** Displays the conversation history between you and the agent system. (`demo/ui/components/conversation.py`)
 40: *   **Input Box:** Where you type your messages to the agent. (`demo/ui/components/conversation.py`)
 41: *   **Agent Management:** Allows adding new agents by providing their [Agent Card](01_agent_card.md) URL. (`demo/ui/pages/agent_list.py`)
 42: *   **Rich Content Rendering:** Can display not just text, but also interactive forms sent by agents (`demo/ui/components/form_render.py`), images, etc.
 43: *   **Task/Event Views:** Provides ways to inspect the underlying [Tasks](02_task.md) and communication events happening via A2A. (`demo/ui/pages/task_list.py`, `demo/ui/pages/event_list.py`)
 44: 
 45: ```python
 46: # File: demo/ui/components/conversation.py (Simplified Snippet)
 47: # ... imports ...
 48: 
 49: @me.component
 50: def conversation():
 51:     """Conversation component"""
 52:     page_state = me.state(PageState) # Local page state
 53:     app_state = me.state(AppState)   # Global application state
 54: 
 55:     # ... loop to display existing messages using chat_bubble component ...
 56:     for message in app_state.messages:
 57:         if is_form(message):
 58:           render_form(message, app_state) # Special handling for forms
 59:         # ... other message types ...
 60:         else:
 61:           chat_bubble(message, message.message_id) # Display regular chat message
 62: 
 63:     # --- Input area ---
 64:     with me.box(style=me.Style(display="flex", flex_direction="row", ...)):
 65:         me.input(
 66:             label="How can I help you?",
 67:             on_enter=send_message_enter, # Function to call when user presses Enter
 68:             # ... other attributes ...
 69:         )
 70:         with me.content_button(on_click=send_message_button): # Button handler
 71:             me.icon(icon="send")
 72: 
 73: async def send_message_enter(e: me.InputEnterEvent):
 74:     # ... (get state) ...
 75:     message_content = e.value
 76:     message_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
 77:     # Store something to indicate a background task is running
 78:     app_state = me.state(AppState)
 79:     app_state.background_tasks[message_id] = "Processing..."
 80:     yield # Update UI to show indicator
 81:     # Call the backend service to actually send the message
 82:     await send_message(message_content, message_id)
 83:     yield # Allow UI to potentially update again
 84: ```
 85: 
 86: **Explanation:**
 87: 
 88: *   This Mesop component defines the chat interface.
 89: *   It uses `app_state` (defined in `demo/ui/state/state.py`) to access the current list of messages and display them.
 90: *   It renders an `me.input` field. When the user presses Enter (`on_enter`), the `send_message_enter` function is called.
 91: *   `send_message_enter` gets the user's text, updates the state to show a "Processing..." indicator, and then calls `send_message` (defined in `demo/ui/state/host_agent_service.py`) which actually communicates with the backend `ConversationServer`.
 92: 
 93: ### 2. Backend (`ConversationServer`)
 94: 
 95: This FastAPI server acts as the bridge between the simple HTTP/JSON communication from the UI and the potentially more complex agent interactions (which might involve A2A or frameworks like Google ADK).
 96: 
 97: *   **API Endpoints:** Exposes simple HTTP endpoints (e.g., `/message/send`, `/conversation/list`) that the UI's client can call. (`demo/ui/service/server/server.py`)
 98: *   **Conversation Management:** Keeps track of different chat sessions.
 99: *   **State Management:** Holds the application state (messages, tasks, agents) that the UI needs to display.
100: *   **Agent Interaction Logic:** Contains the logic to forward requests from the UI to the actual agent system (e.g., the ADK [Host Agent](08_multi_agent_orchestration__host_agent_.md)). (`demo/ui/service/server/adk_host_manager.py`)
101: *   **Callback Handling:** Receives updates (like task status changes or new artifacts) from the agent system and updates its internal state.
102: 
103: ```python
104: # File: demo/ui/service/server/server.py (Simplified Snippet)
105: from fastapi import APIRouter, Request
106: from common.types import Message
107: from .adk_host_manager import ADKHostManager # Implements agent interaction logic
108: # ... other imports ...
109: 
110: class ConversationServer:
111:     def __init__(self, router: APIRouter):
112:         # Choose the manager (e.g., ADKHostManager uses the Host Agent)
113:         self.manager = ADKHostManager()
114: 
115:         # Define API route for sending messages
116:         router.add_api_route(
117:             "/message/send",
118:             self._send_message, # Maps URL to the _send_message method
119:             methods=["POST"])
120:         # ... other routes (/conversation/list, /task/list, etc.) ...
121: 
122:     async def _send_message(self, request: Request):
123:         message_data = await request.json()
124:         # Parse the message data sent by the UI client
125:         message = Message(**message_data['params'])
126:         # Add necessary metadata (IDs, etc.)
127:         message = self.manager.sanitize_message(message)
128:         # --- Crucial Part: Pass message to the agent logic ---
129:         # Run the actual agent processing in a background thread
130:         # so the API call returns quickly to the UI.
131:         thread = threading.Thread(
132:            target=lambda: asyncio.run(self.manager.process_message(message))
133:         )
134:         thread.start()
135:         # Return an immediate confirmation to the UI
136:         return SendMessageResponse(result=MessageInfo(
137:             message_id=message.metadata['message_id'],
138:             # ... other info ...
139:         ))
140: ```
141: 
142: **Explanation:**
143: 
144: *   The `ConversationServer` sets up API routes using FastAPI.
145: *   The `_send_message` method handles requests to the `/message/send` endpoint.
146: *   It parses the `Message` sent from the UI client.
147: *   It calls `self.manager.process_message(message)`. The `manager` (here, `ADKHostManager`) is responsible for actually interacting with the underlying agent system ([Host Agent](08_multi_agent_orchestration__host_agent_.md)).
148: *   Crucially, `process_message` is run in a separate thread so the API can respond quickly, acknowledging receipt, while the potentially long-running agent work happens in the background.
149: 
150: ## How It Works: The Flow of a Message
151: 
152: Let's trace what happens when you type "Hello" and press Enter in the Demo UI:
153: 
154: 1.  **UI (Mesop):** The `on_enter` event triggers `send_message_enter` in `conversation.py`.
155: 2.  **UI State:** `send_message_enter` updates the `AppState` to show a "Processing" indicator.
156: 3.  **UI Client (`host_agent_service.py`):** `send_message_enter` calls `SendMessage(message)`. This function uses the `ConversationClient` to make an HTTP POST request to the `ConversationServer`'s `/message/send` endpoint, sending the user's message as JSON.
157:     ```python
158:     # File: demo/ui/state/host_agent_service.py (Simplified Snippet)
159:     async def SendMessage(message: Message) -> str | None:
160:       client = ConversationClient(server_url) # Backend server URL
161:       try:
162:         # Make HTTP POST request to backend API
163:         response = await client.send_message(SendMessageRequest(params=message))
164:         return response.result # Contains confirmation IDs
165:       except Exception as e:
166:         print("Failed to send message: ", e)
167:     ```
168: 4.  **Backend Service (`server.py`):** The `_send_message` method on the `ConversationServer` receives the POST request.
169: 5.  **Backend Service Logic (`adk_host_manager.py`):** `_send_message` calls `self.manager.process_message(message)` (running in a background thread).
170:     ```python
171:     # File: demo/ui/service/server/adk_host_manager.py (Simplified Snippet)
172:     async def process_message(self, message: Message):
173:         # ... (Store message, add event) ...
174:         # Get conversation context
175:         conversation_id = message.metadata.get('conversation_id')
176:         # --- Interact with the actual agent (e.g., Google ADK Runner) ---
177:         async for event in self._host_runner.run_async(
178:             user_id=self.user_id,
179:             session_id=conversation_id,
180:             new_message=self.adk_content_from_message(message) # Convert to agent format
181:         ):
182:             # Process events coming *back* from the agent
183:             self.add_event(...) # Store for UI event log
184:             # ... potentially update task status via task_callback ...
185:         # ... (Store final response message) ...
186:         # Remove pending indicator
187:         self._pending_message_ids.remove(get_message_id(message))
188:     ```
189: 6.  **Agent Processing:** `process_message` uses the ADK `Runner` (`self._host_runner`) to send the message to the configured agent (our [Host Agent](08_multi_agent_orchestration__host_agent_.md)). The Host Agent might then use its own [A2A Client](05_a2a_client_implementation.md) logic to talk to downstream agents via A2A.
190: 7.  **Agent Response/Updates:** As the agent system works, it sends back events (potentially via [Streaming Communication (SSE)](07_streaming_communication__sse_.md) if using A2A, or via ADK callbacks). The `ADKHostManager`'s `task_callback` or the `run_async` loop processes these updates, storing new messages, updating task statuses, and storing artifacts.
191: 8.  **UI Polling (`page_scaffold.py`):** Meanwhile, the Mesop UI periodically polls the `ConversationServer` for state updates using an `async_poller` component. This poller triggers `UpdateAppState` in `host_agent_service.py`.
192:     ```python
193:     # File: demo/ui/components/page_scaffold.py (Simplified Snippet)
194:     async def refresh_app_state(e: mel.WebEvent): # Triggered by poller
195:         yield
196:         app_state = me.state(AppState)
197:         # Call backend service to get the latest state
198:         await UpdateAppState(app_state, app_state.current_conversation_id)
199:         yield
200:     # ... in page_scaffold component setup ...
201:     async_poller(action=..., trigger_event=refresh_app_state)
202:     ```
203: 9.  **Backend State Request (`host_agent_service.py`):** `UpdateAppState` calls various `ConversationServer` endpoints (like `/conversation/list`, `/message/list`, `/task/list`) to get the latest messages, tasks, etc.
204: 10. **Backend Response:** The `ConversationServer` returns the current state data from its `manager`.
205: 11. **UI Update:** `UpdateAppState` updates the global `AppState` in Mesop with the fresh data. Because Mesop automatically re-renders when state changes, the UI updates to show the agent's response, remove the "Processing" indicator, and update task lists.
206: 
207: ## Under the Hood: Sequence Diagram
208: 
209: This diagram shows the high-level flow for sending a message and getting a response, involving the UI, the Backend Service, and the Agent Logic (like the Host Agent).
210: 
211: ```mermaid

237:         BServer-->>BClient: 200 OK (JSON: state)
238:         BClient->>UI: Update Mesop AppState
239:         Note over UI: Mesop re-renders with new data (agent response)
240:     end
241: ```
242: 
243: ## Conclusion
244: 
245: The Demo UI Application and its associated `ConversationServer` backend provide a crucial, practical tool for the Google A2A project. They act as an interactive "control room" allowing you to:
246: 
247: *   **Visualize** conversations involving one or more A2A agents.
248: *   **Interact** with the system by sending messages.
249: *   **Observe** how components like the [Host Agent](08_multi_agent_orchestration__host_agent_.md) delegate tasks using the A2A protocol.
250: *   **Inspect** the state of [Tasks](02_task.md) and communication events.
251: *   **Experiment** by adding new agents via their [Agent Cards](01_agent_card.md).
252: 
253: It brings together all the concepts we've discussed – servers, clients, tasks, streaming, orchestration – into a tangible demonstration, making the abstract protocol concrete and easier to understand. This completes our journey through the core concepts of the Google A2A protocol and its demonstration application!

  8: # Chapter 1: Graph / StateGraph - The Blueprint of Your Application
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the LangGraph tutorial! We're excited to help you learn how to build powerful, stateful applications with Large Language Models (LLMs).
 11: 
 12: Imagine you're building an application, maybe a chatbot, an agent that performs tasks, or something that processes data in multiple steps. As these applications get more complex, just calling an LLM once isn't enough. You need a way to structure the flow – maybe call an LLM, then a tool, then another LLM based on the result. How do you manage this sequence of steps and the information passed between them?
 13: 
 14: That's where **Graphs** come in!
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Do Graphs Solve?
 17: 
 18: Think of a complex task like baking a cake. You don't just throw all the ingredients in the oven. There's a sequence: mix dry ingredients, mix wet ingredients, combine them, pour into a pan, bake, cool, frost. Each step depends on the previous one.
 19: 
 20: LangGraph helps you define these steps and the order they should happen in. It provides a way to create a **flowchart** or a **blueprint** for your application's logic.
 21: 
 22: The core idea is to break down your application into:
 23: 
 24: 1.  **Nodes:** These are the individual steps or actions (like "mix dry ingredients" or "call the LLM").
 25: 2.  **Edges:** These are the connections or transitions between the steps, defining the order (after mixing dry ingredients, mix wet ingredients).
 26: 
 27: LangGraph provides different types of graphs, but the most common and useful one for building stateful applications is the `StateGraph`.
 28: 
 29: ## Core Concepts: `Graph`, `StateGraph`, and `MessageGraph`
 30: 
 31: Let's look at the main types of graphs you'll encounter:
 32: 
 33: 1.  **`Graph` (The Basic Blueprint)**
 34:     *   This is the most fundamental type. You define nodes (steps) and edges (connections).
 35:     *   It's like a basic flowchart diagram.
 36:     *   You explicitly define how information passes from one node to the next.
 37:     *   While foundational, you'll often use the more specialized `StateGraph` for convenience.
 38: 
 39:     ```python
 40:     # This is a conceptual example - we usually use StateGraph
 41:     from langgraph.graph import Graph
 42: 
 43:     # Define simple functions or Runnables as nodes
 44:     def step_one(input_data):
 45:         print("Running Step 1")
 46:         return input_data * 2
 47: 
 48:     def step_two(processed_data):
 49:         print("Running Step 2")
 50:         return processed_data + 5
 51: 
 52:     # Create a basic graph
 53:     basic_graph_builder = Graph()
 54: 
 55:     # Add nodes
 56:     basic_graph_builder.add_node("A", step_one)
 57:     basic_graph_builder.add_node("B", step_two)
 58: 
 59:     # Add edges (connections)
 60:     basic_graph_builder.add_edge("A", "B") # Run B after A
 61:     basic_graph_builder.set_entry_point("A") # Start at A
 62:     # basic_graph_builder.set_finish_point("B") # Not needed for this simple Graph type
 63:     ```
 64: 
 65: 2.  **`StateGraph` (The Collaborative Whiteboard)**
 66:     *   This is the workhorse for most LangGraph applications. It's a specialized `Graph`.
 67:     *   **Key Idea:** Nodes communicate *implicitly* by reading from and writing to a shared **State** object.
 68:     *   **Analogy:** Imagine a central whiteboard (the State). Each node (person) can read what's on the whiteboard, do some work, and then update the whiteboard with new information or changes.
 69:     *   You define the *structure* of this shared state first (e.g., what keys it holds).
 70:     *   Each node receives the *current* state and returns a *dictionary* containing only the parts of the state it wants to *update*. LangGraph handles merging these updates into the main state.
 71: 
 72: 3.  **`MessageGraph` (The Chatbot Specialist)**
 73:     *   This is a further specialization of `StateGraph`, designed specifically for building chatbots or conversational agents.
 74:     *   It automatically manages a `messages` list within its state.
 75:     *   Nodes typically take the current list of messages and return new messages to be added.
 76:     *   It uses a special function (`add_messages`) to append messages while handling potential duplicates or updates based on message IDs. This makes building chat flows much simpler.
 77: 
 78: For the rest of this chapter, we'll focus on `StateGraph` as it introduces the core concepts most clearly.
 79: 
 80: ## Building a Simple `StateGraph`
 81: 
 82: Let's build a tiny application that takes a number, adds 1 to it, and then multiplies it by 2.
 83: 
 84: **Step 1: Define the State**
 85: 
 86: First, we define the "whiteboard" – the structure of the data our graph will work with. We use Python's `TypedDict` for this.
 87: 
 88: ```python
 89: from typing import TypedDict
 90: 
 91: class MyState(TypedDict):
 92:     # Our state will hold a single number called 'value'
 93:     value: int
 94: ```
 95: 
 96: This tells our `StateGraph` that the shared information will always contain an integer named `value`.
 97: 
 98: **Step 2: Define the Nodes**
 99: 
100: Nodes are functions (or LangChain Runnables) that perform the work. They take the current `State` as input and return a dictionary containing the *updates* to the state.
101: 
102: ```python
103: # Node 1: Adds 1 to the value
104: def add_one(state: MyState) -> dict:
105:     print("--- Running Adder Node ---")
106:     current_value = state['value']
107:     new_value = current_value + 1
108:     print(f"Input value: {current_value}, Output value: {new_value}")
109:     # Return *only* the key we want to update
110:     return {"value": new_value}
111: 
112: # Node 2: Multiplies the value by 2
113: def multiply_by_two(state: MyState) -> dict:
114:     print("--- Running Multiplier Node ---")
115:     current_value = state['value']
116:     new_value = current_value * 2
117:     print(f"Input value: {current_value}, Output value: {new_value}")
118:     # Return the update
119:     return {"value": new_value}
120: ```
121: 
122: Notice how each function takes `state` and returns a `dict` specifying which part of the state (`"value"`) should be updated and with what new value.
123: 
124: **Step 3: Create the Graph and Add Nodes/Edges**
125: 
126: Now we assemble our blueprint using `StateGraph`.
127: 
128: ```python
129: from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END, START
130: 
131: # Create a StateGraph instance linked to our state definition
132: workflow = StateGraph(MyState)
133: 
134: # Add the nodes to the graph
135: workflow.add_node("adder", add_one)
136: workflow.add_node("multiplier", multiply_by_two)
137: 
138: # Set the entry point --> where does the flow start?
139: workflow.set_entry_point("adder")
140: 
141: # Add edges --> how do the nodes connect?
142: workflow.add_edge("adder", "multiplier") # After adder, run multiplier
143: 
144: # Set the finish point --> where does the flow end?
145: # We use the special identifier END
146: workflow.add_edge("multiplier", END)
147: ```
148: 
149: *   `StateGraph(MyState)`: Creates the graph, telling it to use our `MyState` structure.
150: *   `add_node("name", function)`: Registers our functions as steps in the graph with unique names.
151: *   `set_entry_point("adder")`: Specifies that the `adder` node should run first. This implicitly creates an edge from a special `START` point to `adder`.
152: *   `add_edge("adder", "multiplier")`: Creates a connection. After `adder` finishes, `multiplier` will run.
153: *   `add_edge("multiplier", END)`: Specifies that after `multiplier` finishes, the graph execution should stop. `END` is a special marker for the graph's conclusion.
154: 
155: **Step 4: Compile the Graph**
156: 
157: Before we can run it, we need to `compile` the graph. This finalizes the structure and makes it executable.
158: 
159: ```python
160: # Compile the workflow into an executable object
161: app = workflow.compile()
162: ```
163: 
164: **Step 5: Run It!**
165: 
166: Now we can invoke our compiled graph (`app`) with some initial state.
167: 
168: ```python
169: # Define the initial state
170: initial_state = {"value": 5}
171: 
172: # Run the graph
173: final_state = app.invoke(initial_state)
174: 
175: # Print the final result
176: print("\n--- Final State ---")
177: print(final_state)
178: ```
179: 
180: **Expected Output:**
181: 
182: ```text
183: --- Running Adder Node ---
184: Input value: 5, Output value: 6
185: --- Running Multiplier Node ---
186: Input value: 6, Output value: 12
187: 
188: --- Final State ---
189: {'value': 12}
190: ```
191: 
192: As you can see, the graph executed the nodes in the defined order (`adder` then `multiplier`), automatically passing the updated state between them!
193: 
194: ## How Does `StateGraph` Work Under the Hood?
195: 
196: You defined the nodes and edges, but what actually happens when you call `invoke()`?
197: 
198: 1.  **Initialization:** LangGraph takes your initial input (`{"value": 5}`) and puts it onto the "whiteboard" (the internal state).
199: 2.  **Execution Engine:** A powerful internal component called the [Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md) takes over. It looks at the current state and the graph structure.
200: 3.  **Following Edges:** It starts at the `START` node and follows the edge to the entry point (`adder`).
201: 4.  **Node Execution:** It runs the `adder` function, passing it the current state (`{"value": 5}`).
202: 5.  **State Update:** The `adder` function returns `{"value": 6}`. The Pregel engine uses special mechanisms called [Channels](03_channels.md) to update the value associated with the `"value"` key on the "whiteboard". The state is now `{"value": 6}`.
203: 6.  **Next Step:** The engine sees the edge from `adder` to `multiplier`.
204: 7.  **Node Execution:** It runs the `multiplier` function, passing it the *updated* state (`{"value": 6}`).
205: 8.  **State Update:** `multiplier` returns `{"value": 12}`. The engine updates the state again via the [Channels](03_channels.md). The state is now `{"value": 12}`.
206: 9.  **Following Edges:** The engine sees the edge from `multiplier` to `END`.
207: 10. **Finish:** Reaching `END` signals the execution is complete. The final state (`{"value": 12}`) is returned.
208: 
209: Here's a simplified visual:
210: 
211: ```mermaid
212: sequenceDiagram
213:     participant User
214:     participant App (CompiledGraph)
215:     participant State
216:     participant AdderNode as adder
217:     participant MultiplierNode as multiplier
218: 
219:     User->>App: invoke({"value": 5})
220:     App->>State: Initialize state = {"value": 5}
221:     App->>AdderNode: Execute(state)
222:     AdderNode->>State: Read value (5)
223:     AdderNode-->>App: Return {"value": 6}
224:     App->>State: Update state = {"value": 6}
225:     App->>MultiplierNode: Execute(state)
226:     MultiplierNode->>State: Read value (6)
227:     MultiplierNode-->>App: Return {"value": 12}
228:     App->>State: Update state = {"value": 12}
229:     App->>User: Return final state {"value": 12}
230: ```
231: 
232: Don't worry too much about the details of Pregel or Channels yet – we'll cover them in later chapters. The key takeaway is that `StateGraph` manages the state and orchestrates the execution based on your defined nodes and edges.
233: 
234: ## A Peek at the Code (`graph/state.py`, `graph/graph.py`)
235: 
236: Let's briefly look at the code snippets provided to see how these concepts map to the implementation:
237: 
238: *   **`StateGraph.__init__` (`graph/state.py`)**:
239:     ```python
240:     # Simplified view
241:     class StateGraph(Graph):
242:         def __init__(self, state_schema: Optional[Type[Any]] = None, ...):
243:             super().__init__()
244:             # ... stores the state_schema ...
245:             self.schema = state_schema
246:             # ... analyzes the schema to understand state keys and how to update them ...
247:             self._add_schema(state_schema)
248:             # ... sets up internal dictionaries for channels, nodes etc. ...
249:     ```
250:     This code initializes the graph, crucially storing the `state_schema` you provide. It analyzes this schema to figure out the "keys" on your whiteboard (like `"value"`) and sets up the internal structures ([Channels](03_channels.md)) needed to manage updates to each key.
251: 
252: *   **`StateGraph.add_node` (`graph/state.py`)**:
253:     ```python
254:     # Simplified view
255:     def add_node(self, node: str, action: RunnableLike, ...):
256:         # ... basic checks for name conflicts, reserved names (START, END) ...
257:         if node in self.channels: # Cannot use a state key name as a node name
258:              raise ValueError(...)
259:         # ... wrap the provided action (function/runnable) ...
260:         runnable = coerce_to_runnable(action, ...)
261:         # ... store the node details (runnable, input type etc.) ...
262:         self.nodes[node] = StateNodeSpec(runnable, ..., input=input or self.schema, ...)
263:         return self
264:     ```
265:     When you add a node, it stores the associated function (`action`) and links it to the provided `node` name. It also figures out what input schema the node expects (usually the main graph state schema).
266: 
267: *   **`Graph.add_edge` (`graph/graph.py`)**:
268:     ```python
269:     # Simplified view from the base Graph class
270:     def add_edge(self, start_key: str, end_key: str):
271:         # ... checks for invalid edges (e.g., starting from END) ...
272:         # ... basic validation ...
273:         # Stores the connection as a simple pair
274:         self.edges.add((start_key, end_key))
275:         return self
276:     ```
277:     Adding an edge is relatively simple – it just records the `(start_key, end_key)` pair in a set, representing the connection.
278: 
279: *   **`StateGraph.compile` (`graph/state.py`)**:
280:     ```python
281:     # Simplified view
282:     def compile(self, ...):
283:         # ... validation checks ...
284:         self.validate(...)
285:         # ... create the CompiledStateGraph instance ...
286:         compiled = CompiledStateGraph(builder=self, ...)
287:         # ... add nodes, edges, branches to the compiled version ...
288:         for key, node in self.nodes.items():
289:             compiled.attach_node(key, node)
290:         for start, end in self.edges:
291:             compiled.attach_edge(start, end)
292:         # ... more setup for branches, entry/exit points ...
293:         # ... finalize and return the compiled graph ...
294:         return compiled.validate()
295:     ```
296:     Compilation takes your defined nodes and edges and builds the final, executable `CompiledStateGraph`. It sets up the internal machinery ([Pregel](05_pregel_execution_engine.md), [Channels](03_channels.md)) based on your blueprint.
297: 
298: ## Conclusion
299: 
300: You've learned the fundamental concept in LangGraph: the **Graph**.
301: 
302: *   Graphs define the structure and flow of your application using **Nodes** (steps) and **Edges** (connections).
303: *   **`StateGraph`** is the most common type, where nodes communicate implicitly by reading and updating a shared **State** object (like a whiteboard).
304: *   **`MessageGraph`** is a specialized `StateGraph` for easily building chatbots.
305: *   You define the state structure, write node functions that update parts of the state, connect them with edges, and `compile` the graph to make it runnable.
306: 
307: Now that you understand how to define the overall *structure* of your application using `StateGraph`, the next step is to dive deeper into what constitutes a **Node**.
308: 
309: Let's move on to [Chapter 2: Nodes (`PregelNode`)](02_nodes___pregelnode__.md) to explore how individual steps are defined and executed.

  8: # Chapter 2: Nodes (`PregelNode`) - The Workers of Your Graph
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: Graph / StateGraph](01_graph___stategraph.md), we learned how `StateGraph` acts as a blueprint or a flowchart for our application. It defines the overall structure and the shared "whiteboard" (the State) that holds information.
 11: 
 12: But who actually does the work? If the `StateGraph` is the assembly line blueprint, who are the workers on the line?
 13: 
 14: That's where **Nodes** come in!
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Do Nodes Solve?
 17: 
 18: Think back to our cake baking analogy from Chapter 1. We had steps like "mix dry ingredients," "mix wet ingredients," "combine," etc. Each of these distinct actions needs to be performed by someone or something.
 19: 
 20: In LangGraph, **Nodes** represent these individual units of work or computation steps within your graph.
 21: 
 22: *   **Analogy:** Imagine chefs in a kitchen (the graph). Each chef (node) has a specific task: one chops vegetables, another mixes the sauce, another cooks the main course. They all work with shared ingredients (the state) from the pantry and fridge, and they put their finished components back for others to use.
 23: 
 24: Nodes are the core building blocks that perform the actual logic of your application.
 25: 
 26: ## Key Concepts: What Makes a Node?
 27: 
 28: 1.  **The Action:** At its heart, a node is usually a Python function or a LangChain Runnable. This is the code that gets executed when the node runs.
 29: 2.  **Input:** A node typically reads data it needs from the shared graph **State**. It receives the *current* state when it's invoked. In our `StateGraph` example from Chapter 1, both `add_one` and `multiply_by_two` received the `state` dictionary containing the current `value`.
 30: 3.  **Execution:** The node runs its defined logic (the function or Runnable).
 31: 4.  **Output:** After executing, a node in a `StateGraph` returns a dictionary. This dictionary specifies *which parts* of the shared state the node wants to *update* and what the new values should be. LangGraph takes care of merging these updates back into the main state.
 32: 
 33: ## Adding Nodes to Your Graph (`add_node`)
 34: 
 35: How do we tell our `StateGraph` about these workers? We use the `add_node` method.
 36: 
 37: Let's revisit the code from Chapter 1:
 38: 
 39: **Step 1: Define the Node Functions**
 40: 
 41: These are our "workers". They take the state and return updates.
 42: 
 43: ```python
 44: from typing import TypedDict
 45: 
 46: # Define the state structure (the whiteboard)
 47: class MyState(TypedDict):
 48:     value: int
 49: 
 50: # Node 1: Adds 1 to the value
 51: def add_one(state: MyState) -> dict:
 52:     print("--- Running Adder Node ---")
 53:     current_value = state['value']
 54:     new_value = current_value + 1
 55:     print(f"Input value: {current_value}, Output value: {new_value}")
 56:     # Return *only* the key we want to update
 57:     return {"value": new_value}
 58: 
 59: # Node 2: Multiplies the value by 2
 60: def multiply_by_two(state: MyState) -> dict:
 61:     print("--- Running Multiplier Node ---")
 62:     current_value = state['value']
 63:     new_value = current_value * 2
 64:     print(f"Input value: {current_value}, Output value: {new_value}")
 65:     # Return the update
 66:     return {"value": new_value}
 67: ```
 68: 
 69: **Step 2: Create the Graph and Add Nodes**
 70: 
 71: Here's where we hire our workers and assign them names on the assembly line.
 72: 
 73: ```python
 74: from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
 75: 
 76: # Create the graph builder linked to our state
 77: workflow = StateGraph(MyState)
 78: 
 79: # Add the first node:
 80: # Give it the name "adder" and tell it to use the 'add_one' function
 81: workflow.add_node("adder", add_one)
 82: 
 83: # Add the second node:
 84: # Give it the name "multiplier" and tell it to use the 'multiply_by_two' function
 85: workflow.add_node("multiplier", multiply_by_two)
 86: 
 87: # (Edges like set_entry_point, add_edge, etc. define the flow *between* nodes)
 88: # ... add edges and compile ...
 89: ```
 90: 
 91: *   `workflow.add_node("adder", add_one)`: This line registers the `add_one` function as a node within the `workflow` graph. We give it the unique name `"adder"`. When the graph needs to execute the "adder" step, it will call our `add_one` function.
 92: *   `workflow.add_node("multiplier", multiply_by_two)`: Similarly, this registers the `multiply_by_two` function under the name `"multiplier"`.
 93: 
 94: It's that simple! You define what a step does (the function) and then register it with `add_node`, giving it a name so you can connect it using edges later.
 95: 
 96: ## How Do Nodes Actually Run? (Under the Hood)
 97: 
 98: You've defined the functions and added them as nodes. What happens internally when the graph executes?
 99: 
100: 1.  **Triggering:** The [Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md) (LangGraph's internal coordinator) determines which node should run next based on the graph's structure (edges) and the current state. For example, after the `START` point, it knows to run the entry point node ("adder" in our example).
101: 2.  **Reading State:** Before running the node's function (`add_one`), the engine reads the necessary information from the shared state. It knows what the function needs (the `MyState` dictionary). This reading happens via mechanisms called [Channels](03_channels.md), which manage the shared state.
102: 3.  **Invoking the Function:** The engine calls the node's function (e.g., `add_one`), passing the state it just read (`{'value': 5}`).
103: 4.  **Executing Logic:** Your function's code runs (e.g., `5 + 1`).
104: 5.  **Receiving Updates:** The engine receives the dictionary returned by the function (e.g., `{'value': 6}`).
105: 6.  **Writing State:** The engine uses [Channels](03_channels.md) again to update the shared state with the information from the returned dictionary. The state on the "whiteboard" is now modified (e.g., becomes `{'value': 6}`).
106: 7.  **Next Step:** The engine then looks for the next edge originating from the completed node ("adder") to determine what runs next ("multiplier").
107: 
108: Here's a simplified view of the "adder" node executing:
109: 
110: ```mermaid
111: sequenceDiagram
112:     participant Engine as Pregel Engine
113:     participant State (via Channels)
114:     participant AdderNode as adder (add_one func)
115: 
116:     Engine->>State (via Channels): Read 'value' (current state is {'value': 5})
117:     State (via Channels)-->>Engine: Returns {'value': 5}
118:     Engine->>AdderNode: Invoke add_one({'value': 5})
119:     Note over AdderNode: Function executes: 5 + 1 = 6
120:     AdderNode-->>Engine: Return {'value': 6}
121:     Engine->>State (via Channels): Write update: 'value' = 6
122:     State (via Channels)-->>Engine: Acknowledge (state is now {'value': 6})
123:     Engine->>Engine: Find next node based on edge from "adder"
124: ```
125: 
126: ## A Peek at the Code (`graph/state.py`, `pregel/read.py`)
127: 
128: Let's look at simplified snippets to see how this maps to the code:
129: 
130: *   **`StateGraph.add_node` (`graph/state.py`)**:
131:     ```python
132:     # Simplified view
133:     class StateGraph(Graph):
134:         # ... (other methods) ...
135:         def add_node(
136:             self,
137:             node: str,            # The name you give the node (e.g., "adder")
138:             action: RunnableLike, # The function or Runnable (e.g., add_one)
139:             *,
140:             # ... other optional parameters ...
141:             input: Optional[Type[Any]] = None, # Optional: specific input type for this node
142:         ) -> Self:
143:             # ... (checks for valid name, etc.) ...
144:             if node in self.channels: # Can't use a state key name as a node name
145:                 raise ValueError(...)
146: 
147:             # Converts your function into a standard LangChain Runnable if needed
148:             runnable = coerce_to_runnable(action, ...)
149: 
150:             # Stores the node's details, including the runnable and input schema
151:             self.nodes[node] = StateNodeSpec(
152:                 runnable=runnable,
153:                 metadata=None, # Optional metadata
154:                 input=input or self.schema, # Default to graph's main state schema
155:                 # ... other details ...
156:             )
157:             return self
158:     ```
159:     When you call `add_node`, LangGraph stores your function (`action`) under the given `node` name. It wraps your function into a standard `Runnable` object (`coerce_to_runnable`) and keeps track of what input schema it expects (usually the graph's main state schema). This stored information is a `StateNodeSpec`.
160: 
161: *   **`CompiledStateGraph.attach_node` (`graph/state.py`)**:
162:     ```python
163:     # Simplified view (during graph.compile())
164:     class CompiledStateGraph(CompiledGraph):
165:         # ... (other methods) ...
166:         def attach_node(self, key: str, node: Optional[StateNodeSpec]) -> None:
167:             # ... (handles START node specially) ...
168:             if node is not None:
169:                 # Determine what parts of the state this node needs to read
170:                 input_schema = node.input
171:                 input_values = list(self.builder.schemas[input_schema]) # Keys to read
172: 
173:                 # Create the internal representation: PregelNode
174:                 self.nodes[key] = PregelNode(
175:                     triggers=[f"branch:to:{key}"], # When should this node run? (Connected via Channels)
176:                     channels=input_values, # What state keys does it read?
177:                     mapper=_pick_mapper(...), # How to format the input state for the function
178:                     writers=[ChannelWrite(...)], # How to write the output back to state (via Channels)
179:                     bound=node.runnable, # The actual function/Runnable to execute!
180:                     # ... other internal details ...
181:                 )
182:             # ...
183:     ```
184:     During the `compile()` step, the information stored in `StateNodeSpec` is used to create the actual operational node object, which is internally called `PregelNode`. This `PregelNode` is the real "worker" managed by the execution engine.
185: 
186: *   **`PregelNode` (`pregel/read.py`)**:
187:     ```python
188:     # Simplified view
189:     class PregelNode(Runnable):
190:         channels: Union[list[str], Mapping[str, str]] # State keys to read as input
191:         triggers: list[str]                          # Channel updates that activate this node
192:         mapper: Optional[Callable[[Any], Any]]       # Function to format input state
193:         writers: list[Runnable]                      # Runnables to write output back to Channels
194:         bound: Runnable[Any, Any]                    # << THE ACTUAL FUNCTION/RUNNABLE YOU PROVIDED >>
195:         # ... other attributes like retry policy, tags, etc. ...
196: 
197:         def __init__(self, *, channels, triggers, writers, bound, ...) -> None:
198:             self.channels = channels
199:             self.triggers = list(triggers)
200:             self.writers = writers or []
201:             self.bound = bound # Your code lives here!
202:             # ... initialize other attributes ...
203: 
204:         # ... (methods for execution, handled by the Pregel engine) ...
205:     ```
206:     The `PregelNode` object encapsulates everything needed to run your node:
207:     *   `bound`: This holds the actual function or Runnable you passed to `add_node`.
208:     *   `channels`: Specifies which parts of the state (managed by [Channels](03_channels.md)) to read as input.
209:     *   `triggers`: Specifies which [Channels](03_channels.md) must be updated to make this node eligible to run.
210:     *   `writers`: Defines how the output of `bound` should be written back to the state using [Channels](03_channels.md).
211: 
212: Don't worry too much about `PregelNode` details right now. The key idea is that `add_node` registers your function, and `compile` turns it into an executable component (`PregelNode`) that the graph engine can manage, telling it when to run, what state to read, and how to write results back.
213: 
214: ## Conclusion
215: 
216: You've now learned about the "workers" in your LangGraph application: **Nodes**.
217: 
218: *   Nodes are the individual computational steps defined by Python functions or LangChain Runnables.
219: *   They read from the shared `StateGraph` state.
220: *   They execute their logic.
221: *   They return dictionaries specifying updates to the state.
222: *   You add them to your graph using `graph.add_node("node_name", your_function)`.
223: *   Internally, they are represented as `PregelNode` objects, managed by the execution engine.
224: 
225: We have the blueprint (`StateGraph`) and the workers (`Nodes`). But how exactly does information get passed around? How does the "adder" node's output (`{'value': 6}`) reliably get to the "multiplier" node? How is the state managed efficiently?
226: 
227: That's the role of [Chapter 3: Channels](03_channels.md), the communication system of the graph.

  8: # Chapter 3: Channels - The Communication System
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: Graph / StateGraph](01_graph___stategraph.md), we learned about the `StateGraph` as the blueprint for our application, holding the shared "whiteboard" or state. In [Chapter 2: Nodes (`PregelNode`)](02_nodes___pregelnode__.md), we met the "workers" or Nodes that perform tasks and read/write to this whiteboard.
 11: 
 12: But how does this "whiteboard" *actually* work? How does the information written by one node reliably get seen by the next? What happens if multiple nodes try to write to the *same part* of the whiteboard at roughly the same time?
 13: 
 14: This is where **Channels** come in. They are the fundamental mechanism for communication and state management within a `StateGraph`.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Do Channels Solve?
 17: 
 18: Imagine our simple graph from Chapter 1:
 19: 
 20: ```python
 21: # State: {'value': int}
 22: # Node 1: adder (reads 'value', returns {'value': value + 1})
 23: # Node 2: multiplier (reads 'value', returns {'value': value * 2})
 24: # Flow: START -> adder -> multiplier -> END
 25: ```
 26: 
 27: When `adder` runs with `{'value': 5}`, it returns `{'value': 6}`. How does this update the central state so that `multiplier` receives `{'value': 6}` and not the original `{'value': 5}`?
 28: 
 29: Furthermore, what if we had a more complex graph where two different nodes, say `node_A` and `node_B`, both finished their work and *both* wanted to update the `value` key in the same step? Should the final `value` be the one from `node_A`, the one from `node_B`, their sum, or something else?
 30: 
 31: **Channels** solve these problems by defining:
 32: 
 33: 1.  **Storage:** How the value for a specific key in the state is stored.
 34: 2.  **Update Logic:** How incoming updates for that key are combined or processed.
 35: 
 36: ## Channels: Mailboxes for Your State
 37: 
 38: Think of the shared state (our "whiteboard") not as one big surface, but as a collection of **mailboxes**.
 39: 
 40: *   **Each key in your state dictionary (`MyState`) gets its own dedicated mailbox.** In our example, there's a mailbox labeled `"value"`.
 41: *   When a Node finishes and returns a dictionary (like `{'value': 6}`), the [Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md) acts like a mail carrier. It takes the value `6` and puts it into the mailbox labeled `"value"`.
 42: *   When another Node needs to read the state, the engine goes to the relevant mailboxes (like `"value"`) and gets the current contents.
 43: 
 44: This mailbox concept ensures that updates intended for `"value"` only affect `"value"`, and updates for another key (say, `"messages"`) would go into *its* own separate mailbox.
 45: 
 46: **Crucially, each mailbox (Channel) has specific rules about how incoming mail (updates) is handled.** Does the new mail replace the old one? Is it added to a list? Is it mathematically combined with the previous value? These rules are defined by the **Channel Type**.
 47: 
 48: ## How Channels Work: The Update Cycle
 49: 
 50: Here's a step-by-step view of how channels manage state during graph execution:
 51: 
 52: 1.  **Node Returns Update:** A node (e.g., `adder`) finishes and returns a dictionary (e.g., `{'value': 6}`).
 53: 2.  **Engine Routes Update:** The [Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md) sees the key `"value"` and routes the update `6` to the Channel associated with `"value"`.
 54: 3.  **Channel Receives Update(s):** The `"value"` Channel receives `6`. If other nodes also returned updates for `"value"` in the same step, the Channel would receive all of them in a sequence (e.g., `[6, maybe_another_update]`).
 55: 4.  **Channel Applies Update Logic:** The Channel uses its specific rule (its type) to process the incoming update(s). For example, a `LastValue` channel would just keep the *last* update it received in the sequence. A `BinaryOperatorAggregate` channel might *sum* all the updates with its current value.
 56: 5.  **State is Updated:** The Channel now holds the new, processed value.
 57: 6.  **Node Reads State:** When the next node (e.g., `multiplier`) needs the state, the Engine queries the relevant Channels (e.g., the `"value"` Channel).
 58: 7.  **Channel Provides Value:** The Channel provides its current stored value (e.g., `6`) to the Engine, which passes it to the node.
 59: 
 60: This ensures that state updates are handled consistently according to predefined rules for each piece of state.
 61: 
 62: ## Common Channel Types: Defining the Rules
 63: 
 64: LangGraph provides several types of Channels, each with different update logic. You usually define which channel type to use for a state key when you define your state `TypedDict`, often using `typing.Annotated`.
 65: 
 66: Here are the most common ones:
 67: 
 68: 1.  **`LastValue[T]`** (The Default Overwriter)
 69:     *   **Rule:** Keeps only the **last** value it received. If multiple updates arrive in the same step, the final value is simply the last one in the sequence processed by the engine.
 70:     *   **Analogy:** Like a standard variable assignment (`my_variable = new_value`). The old value is discarded.
 71:     *   **When to Use:** This is the **default** for keys in your `TypedDict` state unless you specify otherwise with `Annotated`. It's perfect for state values that should be replaced entirely, like the current step's result or a user's latest query.
 72:     *   **Code:** `langgraph.channels.LastValue` (from `channels/last_value.py`)
 73: 
 74:     ```python
 75:     # channels/last_value.py (Simplified)
 76:     class LastValue(Generic[Value], BaseChannel[Value, Value, Value]):
 77:         # ... (initializer, etc.)
 78:         value: Any = MISSING # Stores the single, last value
 79: 
 80:         def update(self, values: Sequence[Value]) -> bool:
 81:             if len(values) == 0: # No updates this step
 82:                 return False
 83:             # If multiple updates in one step, only the last one matters!
 84:             # Example: if values = [update1, update2], self.value becomes update2
 85:             self.value = values[-1]
 86:             return True
 87: 
 88:         def get(self) -> Value:
 89:             if self.value is MISSING:
 90:                 raise EmptyChannelError()
 91:             return self.value # Return the currently stored last value
 92:     ```
 93:     *   **How to Use (Implicitly):**
 94:         ```python
 95:         from typing import TypedDict
 96: 
 97:         class MyState(TypedDict):
 98:              # Because we didn't use Annotated, LangGraph defaults to LastValue[int]
 99:              value: int
100:              user_query: str # Also defaults to LastValue[str]
101:         ```
102: 
103: 2.  **`BinaryOperatorAggregate[T]`** (The Combiner)
104:     *   **Rule:** Takes an initial "identity" value (like `0` for addition, `1` for multiplication) and a **binary operator** function (e.g., `+`, `*`, `operator.add`). When it receives updates, it applies the operator between its current value and each new update, accumulating the result.
105:     *   **Analogy:** Like a running total (`total += new_number`).
106:     *   **When to Use:** Useful for accumulating scores, counts, or combining numerical results.
107:     *   **Code:** `langgraph.channels.BinaryOperatorAggregate` (from `channels/binop.py`)
108: 
109:     ```python
110:     # channels/binop.py (Simplified)
111:     import operator
112:     from typing import Callable
113: 
114:     class BinaryOperatorAggregate(Generic[Value], BaseChannel[Value, Value, Value]):
115:         # ... (initializer stores the operator and identity value)
116:         value: Any = MISSING
117:         operator: Callable[[Value, Value], Value]
118: 
119:         def update(self, values: Sequence[Value]) -> bool:
120:             if not values:
121:                 return False
122:             # Start with the first value if the channel was empty
123:             if self.value is MISSING:
124:                 self.value = values[0]
125:                 values = values[1:]
126:             # Apply the operator for all subsequent values
127:             for val in values:
128:                 self.value = self.operator(self.value, val)
129:             return True
130: 
131:         def get(self) -> Value:
132:             # ... (return self.value, handling MISSING)
133:     ```
134:     *   **How to Use (Explicitly with `Annotated`):**
135:         ```python
136:         import operator
137:         from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
138:         from langgraph.channels import BinaryOperatorAggregate
139: 
140:         class AgentState(TypedDict):
141:             # Use Annotated to specify the channel type and operator
142:             total_score: Annotated[int, BinaryOperatorAggregate(int, operator.add)]
143:             # ^^^ state key 'total_score' will use BinaryOperatorAggregate with addition
144:         ```
145: 
146: 3.  **`Topic[T]`** (The Collector)
147:     *   **Rule:** Collects all updates it receives into a **list**. By default (`accumulate=False`), it clears the list after each step, so `get()` returns only the updates from the *immediately preceding* step. If `accumulate=True`, it keeps adding to the list across multiple steps.
148:     *   **Analogy:** Like appending to a log file or a list (`my_list.append(new_item)`).
149:     *   **When to Use:** Great for gathering messages in a conversation (`MessageGraph` uses this internally!), collecting events, or tracking a sequence of results.
150:     *   **Code:** `langgraph.channels.Topic` (from `channels/topic.py`)
151: 
152:     ```python
153:     # channels/topic.py (Simplified)
154:     from typing import Sequence, List, Union
155: 
156:     class Topic(Generic[Value], BaseChannel[Sequence[Value], Union[Value, list[Value]], list[Value]]):
157:         # ... (initializer sets accumulate flag)
158:         values: list[Value]
159:         accumulate: bool
160: 
161:         def update(self, updates: Sequence[Union[Value, list[Value]]]) -> bool:
162:             old_len = len(self.values)
163:             # Clear list if not accumulating
164:             if not self.accumulate:
165:                 self.values = []
166:             # Flatten and extend the list with new updates
167:             new_values = list(flatten(updates)) # flatten handles list-of-lists
168:             self.values.extend(new_values)
169:             return len(self.values) != old_len # Return True if list changed
170: 
171:         def get(self) -> Sequence[Value]:
172:             # ... (return list(self.values), handling empty)
173:     ```
174:     *   **How to Use (Explicitly with `Annotated`):**
175:         ```python
176:         from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List
177:         from langgraph.channels import Topic
178: 
179:         class ChatState(TypedDict):
180:             # Use Annotated to specify the Topic channel
181:             # The final type hint for the state is List[str]
182:             chat_history: Annotated[List[str], Topic(str, accumulate=True)]
183:             # ^^^ state key 'chat_history' will use Topic to accumulate strings
184:         ```
185: 
186: There are other specialized channels like `EphemeralValue` (clears after reading) and `Context` (allows passing values down without modifying state), but `LastValue`, `BinaryOperatorAggregate`, and `Topic` are the most fundamental.
187: 
188: ## Channels in Action: Our Simple Graph Revisited
189: 
190: Let's trace our `adder` -> `multiplier` graph again, focusing on the implicit `LastValue` channel for the `"value"` key:
191: 
192: ```python
193: from typing import TypedDict
194: from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END, START
195: 
196: # State uses implicit LastValue[int] for 'value'
197: class MyState(TypedDict):
198:     value: int
199: 
200: # Nodes (same as before)
201: def add_one(state: MyState) -> dict:
202:     return {"value": state['value'] + 1}
203: 
204: def multiply_by_two(state: MyState) -> dict:
205:     return {"value": state['value'] * 2}
206: 
207: # Graph setup (same as before)
208: workflow = StateGraph(MyState)
209: workflow.add_node("adder", add_one)
210: workflow.add_node("multiplier", multiply_by_two)
211: workflow.set_entry_point("adder")
212: workflow.add_edge("adder", "multiplier")
213: workflow.add_edge("multiplier", END)
214: app = workflow.compile()
215: 
216: # Execution with initial state {"value": 5}
217: initial_state = {"value": 5}
218: final_state = app.invoke(initial_state)
219: ```
220: 
221: Here's the flow with the Channel involved:
222: 
223: ```mermaid
224: sequenceDiagram
225:     participant User
226:     participant App as CompiledGraph
227:     participant Engine as Pregel Engine
228:     participant ValueChannel as "value" (LastValue)
229:     participant AdderNode as adder
230:     participant MultiplierNode as multiplier
231: 
232:     User->>App: invoke({"value": 5})
233:     App->>Engine: Start execution
234:     Engine->>ValueChannel: Initialize/Set state from input (value = 5)
235:     App->>Engine: Entry point is "adder"
236:     Engine->>ValueChannel: Read current value (5)
237:     ValueChannel-->>Engine: Returns 5
238:     Engine->>AdderNode: Execute(state={'value': 5})
239:     AdderNode-->>Engine: Return {"value": 6}
240:     Engine->>ValueChannel: Update with [6]
241:     Note over ValueChannel: LastValue rule: value becomes 6
242:     ValueChannel-->>Engine: Acknowledge update
243:     Engine->>Engine: Follow edge "adder" -> "multiplier"
244:     Engine->>ValueChannel: Read current value (6)
245:     ValueChannel-->>Engine: Returns 6
246:     Engine->>MultiplierNode: Execute(state={'value': 6})
247:     MultiplierNode-->>Engine: Return {"value": 12}
248:     Engine->>ValueChannel: Update with [12]
249:     Note over ValueChannel: LastValue rule: value becomes 12
250:     ValueChannel-->>Engine: Acknowledge update
251:     Engine->>Engine: Follow edge "multiplier" -> END
252:     Engine->>ValueChannel: Read final value (12)
253:     ValueChannel-->>Engine: Returns 12
254:     Engine->>App: Execution finished, final state {'value': 12}
255:     App->>User: Return final state {'value': 12}
256: ```
257: 
258: The `LastValue` channel ensures that the output of `adder` correctly overwrites the initial state before `multiplier` reads it.
259: 
260: ## Example: Using `BinaryOperatorAggregate` Explicitly
261: 
262: Let's modify the state to *sum* values instead of overwriting them.
263: 
264: ```python
265: import operator
266: from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
267: from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END, START
268: # Import the channel type
269: from langgraph.channels import BinaryOperatorAggregate
270: 
271: # Define state with an explicitly configured channel
272: class SummingState(TypedDict):
273:     # Use Annotated to specify the channel and its operator (addition)
274:     value: Annotated[int, BinaryOperatorAggregate(int, operator.add)]
275: 
276: # Node 1: Returns 5 to be ADDED to the current value
277: def add_five(state: SummingState) -> dict:
278:     print(f"--- Running Adder Node 1 (current value: {state.get('value', 0)}) ---")
279:     # Note: We return the *increment*, not the new total
280:     return {"value": 5}
281: 
282: # Node 2: Returns 10 to be ADDED to the current value
283: def add_ten(state: SummingState) -> dict:
284:     print(f"--- Running Adder Node 2 (current value: {state['value']}) ---")
285:      # Note: We return the *increment*, not the new total
286:     return {"value": 10}
287: 
288: # Create graph
289: workflow = StateGraph(SummingState)
290: workflow.add_node("adder1", add_five)
291: workflow.add_node("adder2", add_ten)
292: workflow.set_entry_point("adder1")
293: workflow.add_edge("adder1", "adder2")
294: workflow.add_edge("adder2", END)
295: 
296: app = workflow.compile()
297: 
298: # Run with initial state value = 0 (BinaryOperatorAggregate defaults int to 0)
299: print("Invoking graph...")
300: # You could also provide an initial value: app.invoke({"value": 100})
301: final_state = app.invoke({})
302: 
303: print("\n--- Final State ---")
304: print(final_state)
305: ```
306: 
307: **Expected Output:**
308: 
309: ```text
310: Invoking graph...
311: --- Running Adder Node 1 (current value: 0) ---
312: --- Running Adder Node 2 (current value: 5) ---
313: 
314: --- Final State ---
315: {'value': 15}
316: ```
317: 
318: Because we used `Annotated[int, BinaryOperatorAggregate(int, operator.add)]`, the `"value"` channel now *adds* incoming updates (`5` then `10`) to its current state, resulting in a final sum of `15`.
319: 
320: ## How `StateGraph` Finds the Right Channel
321: 
322: You might wonder how `StateGraph` knows whether to use `LastValue` or something else. When you initialize `StateGraph(MyState)`, it inspects your state schema (`MyState`).
323: 
324: *   It uses Python's `get_type_hints(MyState, include_extras=True)` to look at each field (like `value`).
325: *   If a field has `Annotated[SomeType, SomeChannelConfig]`, it uses `SomeChannelConfig` (e.g., `BinaryOperatorAggregate(...)`, `Topic(...)`) to create the channel for that key.
326: *   If a field is just `SomeType` (like `value: int`), it defaults to creating a `LastValue[SomeType]` channel for that key.
327: 
328: This logic is primarily handled within the `StateGraph._add_schema` method, which calls internal helpers like `_get_channels`.
329: 
330: ```python
331: # graph/state.py (Simplified view of channel detection)
332: 
333: def _get_channels(schema: Type[dict]) -> tuple[...]:
334:     # ... gets type hints including Annotated metadata ...
335:     type_hints = get_type_hints(schema, include_extras=True)
336:     all_keys = {}
337:     for name, typ in type_hints.items():
338:          # Checks if the annotation specifies a channel or binop
339:         if channel := _is_field_channel(typ) or _is_field_binop(typ):
340:              channel.key = name
341:              all_keys[name] = channel
342:         else:
343:              # Default case: Use LastValue
344:              fallback = LastValue(typ)
345:              fallback.key = name
346:              all_keys[name] = fallback
347:     # ... separate BaseChannel instances from ManagedValueSpec ...
348:     return channels, managed_values, type_hints
349: 
350: def _is_field_channel(typ: Type[Any]) -> Optional[BaseChannel]:
351:     # Checks if Annotated metadata contains a BaseChannel instance or class
352:     if hasattr(typ, "__metadata__"):
353:         meta = typ.__metadata__
354:         if len(meta) >= 1 and isinstance(meta[-1], BaseChannel):
355:             return meta[-1] # Return the channel instance directly
356:         # ... (handle channel classes too) ...
357:     return None
358: 
359: def _is_field_binop(typ: Type[Any]) -> Optional[BinaryOperatorAggregate]:
360:     # Checks if Annotated metadata contains a callable (the reducer function)
361:     if hasattr(typ, "__metadata__"):
362:         meta = typ.__metadata__
363:         if len(meta) >= 1 and callable(meta[-1]):
364:             # ... (validate function signature) ...
365:             return BinaryOperatorAggregate(typ, meta[-1]) # Create binop channel
366:     return None
367: 
368: # --- In StateGraph.__init__ ---
369: # self._add_schema(state_schema) # This calls _get_channels
370: ```
371: 
372: ## Under the Hood: `BaseChannel`
373: 
374: All channel types inherit from a base class called `BaseChannel`. This class defines the common interface that the [Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md) uses to interact with any channel.
375: 
376: ```python
377: # channels/base.py (Simplified Abstract Base Class)
378: from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
379: from typing import Generic, Sequence, TypeVar
380: 
381: Value = TypeVar("Value") # The type of the stored state
382: Update = TypeVar("Update") # The type of incoming updates
383: Checkpoint = TypeVar("Checkpoint") # The type of saved state
384: 
385: class BaseChannel(Generic[Value, Update, Checkpoint], ABC):
386:     # ... (init, type properties) ...
387: 
388:     @abstractmethod
389:     def update(self, values: Sequence[Update]) -> bool:
390:         """Combines the sequence of updates with the current channel value."""
391:         # Must be implemented by subclasses (like LastValue, Topic)
392:         pass
393: 
394:     @abstractmethod
395:     def get(self) -> Value:
396:         """Returns the current value of the channel."""
397:         # Must be implemented by subclasses
398:         pass
399: 
400:     @abstractmethod
401:     def checkpoint(self) -> Checkpoint:
402:         """Returns a serializable representation of the channel's state."""
403:         # Used by the Checkpointer
404:         pass
405: 
406:     @abstractmethod
407:     def from_checkpoint(self, checkpoint: Checkpoint) -> Self:
408:         """Creates a new channel instance from a saved checkpoint."""
409:         # Used by the Checkpointer
410:         pass
411: ```
412: 
413: The specific logic for `LastValue`, `Topic`, `BinaryOperatorAggregate`, etc., is implemented within their respective `update` and `get` methods, adhering to this common interface. The `checkpoint` and `from_checkpoint` methods are crucial for saving and loading the graph's state, which we'll explore more in [Chapter 6: Checkpointer (`BaseCheckpointSaver`)](06_checkpointer___basecheckpointsaver__.md).
414: 
415: ## Conclusion
416: 
417: You've learned about **Channels**, the crucial communication and state management system within LangGraph's `StateGraph`.
418: 
419: *   Channels act like **mailboxes** for each key in your graph's state.
420: *   They define **how updates are combined** when nodes write to the state.
421: *   The default channel is **`LastValue`**, which overwrites the previous value.
422: *   You can use `typing.Annotated` in your state definition to specify other channel types like **`BinaryOperatorAggregate`** (for combining values, e.g., summing) or **`Topic`** (for collecting updates into a list).
423: *   `StateGraph` automatically creates the correct channel for each state key based on your type hints.
424: 
425: Understanding channels helps you control precisely how information flows and accumulates in your stateful applications.
426: 
427: Now that we know how the state is managed (Channels) and how work gets done (Nodes), how do we control the *flow* of execution? What if we want to go to different nodes based on the current state? That's where conditional logic comes in.
428: 
429: Let's move on to [Chapter 4: Control Flow Primitives (`Branch`, `Send`, `Interrupt`)](04_control_flow_primitives___branch____send____interrupt__.md) to learn how to direct the traffic within our graph.

  8: # Chapter 4: Control Flow Primitives (`Branch`, `Send`, `Interrupt`)
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 3: Channels](03_channels.md), we saw how information is stored and updated in our graph's shared state using Channels. We have the blueprint ([`StateGraph`](01_graph___stategraph.md)), the workers ([`Nodes`](02_nodes___pregelnode__.md)), and the communication system ([Channels](03_channels.md)).
 11: 
 12: But what if we don't want our graph to follow a single, fixed path? What if we need it to make decisions? For example, imagine a chatbot: sometimes it needs to use a tool (like a search engine), and other times it can answer directly. How do we tell the graph *which* path to take based on the current situation?
 13: 
 14: This is where **Control Flow Primitives** come in. They are special mechanisms that allow you to dynamically direct the execution path of your graph, making it much more flexible and powerful.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Do Control Flow Primitives Solve?
 17: 
 18: Think of our graph like a train system. So far, we've only built tracks that go in a straight line from one station (node) to the next. Control flow primitives are like the **switches** and **signals** that allow the train (our execution flow) to:
 19: 
 20: 1.  **Choose a path:** Decide whether to go left or right at a junction based on some condition (like an "if" statement).
 21: 2.  **Dispatch specific trains:** Send a specific piece of cargo directly to a particular station, maybe even multiple pieces to the same station to be processed in parallel.
 22: 3.  **Wait for instructions:** Pause the train journey until an external signal (like human approval) is given.
 23: 
 24: LangGraph provides three main primitives for this:
 25: 
 26: *   **`Branch`**: Acts like a conditional router or switch ("if/else"). It directs the flow to different nodes based on the current state.
 27: *   **`Send`**: Allows a node to directly trigger another node with specific input, useful for parallel processing patterns like map-reduce.
 28: *   **`Interrupt`**: Pauses the graph execution, usually to wait for external input (like a human clicking "Approve") before continuing.
 29: 
 30: Let's explore each one.
 31: 
 32: ## 1. `Branch` - The Conditional Router
 33: 
 34: Imagine our chatbot needs to decide: "Should I use the search tool, or can I answer from my knowledge?" This decision depends on the conversation history or the user's specific question stored in the graph's state.
 35: 
 36: The `Branch` primitive allows us to implement this kind of conditional logic. You add it using the `graph.add_conditional_edges()` method.
 37: 
 38: **How it Works:**
 39: 
 40: 1.  You define a regular node (let's call it `should_i_search`).
 41: 2.  You define a separate **routing function**. This function takes the current state and decides *which node* should run next. It returns the name of the next node (or a list of names).
 42: 3.  You connect the `should_i_search` node to the routing function using `add_conditional_edges`. You tell it: "After `should_i_search` finishes, call this routing function to decide where to go next."
 43: 4.  You provide a mapping (a dictionary) that links the possible return values of your routing function to the actual node names in your graph.
 44: 
 45: **Example: Chatbot Deciding to Search**
 46: 
 47: Let's build a tiny graph that decides whether to go to a `search_tool` node or a `respond_directly` node.
 48: 
 49: **Step 1: Define State**
 50: 
 51: ```python
 52: from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List
 53: import operator
 54: 
 55: class ChatState(TypedDict):
 56:     user_query: str
 57:     # We'll store the decision here
 58:     next_action: str
 59:     # Keep track of intermediate results
 60:     search_result: Annotated[List[str], operator.add] # Use Topic or add if accumulating
 61:     final_response: str
 62: ```
 63: 
 64: Our state holds the user's query and a field `next_action` to store the decision.
 65: 
 66: **Step 2: Define Nodes**
 67: 
 68: ```python
 69: # Node that decides the next step
 70: def determine_action(state: ChatState) -> dict:
 71:     print("--- Determining Action ---")
 72:     query = state['user_query']
 73:     if "weather" in query.lower():
 74:         print("Decision: Need to use search tool for weather.")
 75:         return {"next_action": "USE_TOOL"}
 76:     else:
 77:         print("Decision: Can respond directly.")
 78:         return {"next_action": "RESPOND"}
 79: 
 80: # Node representing the search tool
 81: def run_search_tool(state: ChatState) -> dict:
 82:     print("--- Using Search Tool ---")
 83:     query = state['user_query']
 84:     # Simulate finding a result
 85:     result = f"Search result for '{query}': It's sunny!"
 86:     # We return the result to be ADDED to the state list
 87:     return {"search_result": [result]} # Return as list for operator.add
 88: 
 89: # Node that generates a final response
 90: def generate_response(state: ChatState) -> dict:
 91:     print("--- Generating Response ---")
 92:     if state.get("search_result"):
 93:         response = f"Based on my search: {state['search_result'][-1]}"
 94:     else:
 95:         response = f"Responding directly to: {state['user_query']}"
 96:     return {"final_response": response}
 97: ```
 98: 
 99: **Step 3: Define the Routing Function**
100: 
101: This function reads the `next_action` from the state and returns the *key* we'll use in our mapping.
102: 
103: ```python
104: def route_based_on_action(state: ChatState) -> str:
105:     print("--- Routing ---")
106:     action = state['next_action']
107:     print(f"Routing based on action: {action}")
108:     if action == "USE_TOOL":
109:         return "route_to_tool" # This key must match our path_map
110:     else:
111:         return "route_to_respond" # This key must match our path_map
112: ```
113: 
114: **Step 4: Build the Graph with Conditional Edges**
115: 
116: ```python
117: from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END, START
118: 
119: workflow = StateGraph(ChatState)
120: 
121: workflow.add_node("decider", determine_action)
122: workflow.add_node("search_tool", run_search_tool)
123: workflow.add_node("responder", generate_response)
124: 
125: workflow.set_entry_point("decider")
126: 
127: # After 'decider', call 'route_based_on_action' to choose the next step
128: workflow.add_conditional_edges(
129:     "decider", # Start node
130:     route_based_on_action, # The routing function
131:     {
132:         # Map the routing function's output to actual node names
133:         "route_to_tool": "search_tool",
134:         "route_to_respond": "responder"
135:     }
136: )
137: 
138: # Define what happens *after* the conditional paths
139: workflow.add_edge("search_tool", "responder") # After searching, generate response
140: workflow.add_edge("responder", END) # After responding, end
141: 
142: # Compile
143: app = workflow.compile()
144: ```
145: 
146: *   `add_conditional_edges("decider", route_based_on_action, ...)`: This is the key part. It tells LangGraph: after the "decider" node runs, execute the `route_based_on_action` function.
147: *   `path_map = {"route_to_tool": "search_tool", ...}`: This dictionary maps the string returned by `route_based_on_action` to the actual next node to execute.
148: 
149: **Step 5: Run It!**
150: 
151: ```python
152: # Scenario 1: Query needs the tool
153: print("--- Scenario 1: Weather Query ---")
154: input1 = {"user_query": "What's the weather like?"}
155: final_state1 = app.invoke(input1)
156: print("Final State 1:", final_state1)
157: 
158: print("\n--- Scenario 2: Direct Response ---")
159: # Scenario 2: Query doesn't need the tool
160: input2 = {"user_query": "Tell me a joke."}
161: final_state2 = app.invoke(input2)
162: print("Final State 2:", final_state2)
163: ```
164: 
165: **Expected Output:**
166: 
167: ```text
168: --- Scenario 1: Weather Query ---
169: --- Determining Action ---
170: Decision: Need to use search tool for weather.
171: --- Routing ---
172: Routing based on action: USE_TOOL
173: --- Using Search Tool ---
174: --- Generating Response ---
175: Final State 1: {'user_query': "What's the weather like?", 'next_action': 'USE_TOOL', 'search_result': ["Search result for 'What's the weather like?': It's sunny!"], 'final_response': "Based on my search: Search result for 'What's the weather like?': It's sunny!"}
176: 
177: --- Scenario 2: Direct Response ---
178: --- Determining Action ---
179: Decision: Can respond directly.
180: --- Routing ---
181: Routing based on action: RESPOND
182: --- Generating Response ---
183: Final State 2: {'user_query': 'Tell me a joke.', 'next_action': 'RESPOND', 'search_result': [], 'final_response': 'Responding directly to: Tell me a joke.'}
184: ```
185: 
186: See how the graph took different paths based on the `next_action` set by the `decider` node and interpreted by the `route_based_on_action` function!

188: **Visualizing the Branch:**
189: 
190: ```mermaid
191: graph TD
192:     Start[START] --> Decider(decider);
193:     Decider -- route_based_on_action --> Route{Routing Logic};
194:     Route -- "route_to_tool" --> Search(search_tool);
195:     Route -- "route_to_respond" --> Respond(responder);
196:     Search --> Respond;
197:     Respond --> End(END);
198: ```
199: 
200: **Internals (`graph/branch.py`)**
201: 
202: *   When you call `add_conditional_edges`, LangGraph stores a `Branch` object (`graph/branch.py`). This object holds your routing function (`path`) and the mapping (`path_map` / `ends`).
203: *   During execution, after the source node ("decider") finishes, the [Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md) runs the `Branch` object.
204: *   The `Branch.run()` method eventually calls your routing function (`_route` or `_aroute` internally) with the current state.
205: *   It takes the return value (e.g., "route_to_tool"), looks it up in the `ends` dictionary to get the actual node name ("search_tool"), and tells the engine to schedule that node next.
206: 
207: ```python
208: # graph/branch.py (Simplified view)
209: class Branch(NamedTuple):
210:     path: Runnable # Your routing function wrapped as a Runnable
211:     ends: Optional[dict[Hashable, str]] # Your path_map
212:     # ... other fields ...
213: 
214:     def _route(self, input: Any, config: RunnableConfig, ...) -> Runnable:
215:         # ... reads current state if needed ...
216:         value = ... # Get the state
217:         result = self.path.invoke(value, config) # Call your routing function
218:         # ... determines destination node(s) using self.ends mapping ...
219:         destinations = [self.ends[r] for r in result]
220:         # ... tells the engine (via writer) which node(s) to run next ...
221:         return writer(destinations, config) or input # writer is a callback to the engine

229:         # Create and store the Branch object
230:         self.branches[source][name] = Branch.from_path(runnable_path, path_map, ...)
231:         return self
232: ```
233: 
234: ## 2. `Send` - Directing Specific Traffic
235: 
236: Sometimes, you don't just want to choose *one* path, but you want to trigger a *specific* node with *specific* data, possibly multiple times. This is common in "map-reduce" patterns where you split a task into smaller pieces, process each piece independently, and then combine the results.
237: 
238: The `Send` primitive allows a node (or a conditional edge function) to directly "send" a piece of data to another node, telling the engine: "Run *this* node next, and give it *this* input."
239: 
240: **How it Works:**
241: 
242: 1.  You import `Send` from `langgraph.graph` (or `langgraph.types`).
243: 2.  In a node or a conditional edge function, instead of just returning a state update or a node name, you return `Send(target_node_name, data_for_that_node)`.
244: 3.  You can return a list of `Send` objects to trigger multiple node executions, potentially in parallel (depending on the executor).
245: 
246: **Example: Simple Map-Reduce**
247: 
248: Let's imagine we want to process a list of items. One node splits the list, another node processes each item individually (the "map" step), and a final node aggregates the results (the "reduce" step).
249: 
250: **Step 1: Define State**
251: 
252: ```python
253: from typing import TypedDict, List, Annotated
254: import operator
255: 
256: class MapReduceState(TypedDict):
257:     items_to_process: List[str]
258:     # Use Topic or operator.add to collect results from worker nodes
259:     processed_items: Annotated[List[str], operator.add]
260:     final_result: str
261: ```
262: 
263: **Step 2: Define Nodes**
264: 
265: ```python
266: # Node to prepare items (not really needed here, but shows the flow)
267: def prepare_items(state: MapReduceState) -> dict:
268:     print("--- Preparing Items (No change) ---")
269:     # In a real scenario, this might fetch or generate the items
270:     return {}
271: 
272: # Node to process a single item (Our "Worker")
273: def process_single_item(state: dict) -> dict:
274:     # Note: This node receives the dict passed via Send, NOT the full MapReduceState
275:     item = state['item']
276:     print(f"--- Processing Item: {item} ---")
277:     processed = f"Processed_{item.upper()}"
278:     # Return the processed item to be ADDED to the list in the main state
279:     return {"processed_items": [processed]} # Return list for operator.add
280: 
281: # Node to aggregate results
282: def aggregate_results(state: MapReduceState) -> dict:
283:     print("--- Aggregating Results ---")
284:     all_processed = state['processed_items']
285:     final = ", ".join(all_processed)
286:     return {"final_result": final}
287: ```
288: 
289: **Step 3: Define the Dispatching Function (using `Send`)**
290: 
291: This function will run after `prepare_items` and will use `Send` to trigger `process_single_item` for each item.
292: 
293: ```python
294: from langgraph.graph import Send # Import Send
295: 
296: def dispatch_work(state: MapReduceState) -> List[Send]:
297:     print("--- Dispatching Work ---")
298:     items = state['items_to_process']
299:     send_packets = []
300:     for item in items:
301:         print(f"Sending item '{item}' to worker node.")
302:         # Create a Send object for each item
303:         # Target node: "worker"
304:         # Data payload: a dictionary {'item': current_item}
305:         packet = Send("worker", {"item": item})
306:         send_packets.append(packet)
307:     return send_packets # Return a list of Send objects
308: ```
309: 
310: **Step 4: Build the Graph**
311: 
312: ```python
313: from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END, START
314: 
315: workflow = StateGraph(MapReduceState)
316: 
317: workflow.add_node("preparer", prepare_items)
318: workflow.add_node("worker", process_single_item) # The node targeted by Send
319: workflow.add_node("aggregator", aggregate_results)
320: 
321: workflow.set_entry_point("preparer")
322: 
323: # After 'preparer', call 'dispatch_work' which returns Send packets
324: workflow.add_conditional_edges("preparer", dispatch_work)
325: # NOTE: We don't need a path_map here because dispatch_work directly
326: #       returns Send objects specifying the target node.
327: 
328: # The 'worker' node outputs are aggregated implicitly by the 'processed_items' channel.
329: # We need an edge to tell the graph when to run the aggregator.
330: # Let's wait until ALL workers triggered by Send are done.
331: # We can achieve this implicitly if the aggregator reads state written by workers.
332: # A simple edge ensures aggregator runs *after* the step involving workers.
333: # (More complex aggregation might need explicit barrier channels)
334: workflow.add_edge("worker", "aggregator")
335: 
336: workflow.add_edge("aggregator", END)
337: 
338: # Compile
339: app = workflow.compile()
340: ```
341: 
342: **Step 5: Run It!**
343: 
344: ```python
345: input_state = {"items_to_process": ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]}
346: final_state = app.invoke(input_state)
347: print("\nFinal State:", final_state)
348: ```
349: 
350: **Expected Output (order of processing might vary):**
351: 
352: ```text
353: --- Preparing Items (No change) ---
354: --- Dispatching Work ---
355: Sending item 'apple' to worker node.
356: Sending item 'banana' to worker node.
357: Sending item 'cherry' to worker node.
358: --- Processing Item: apple ---
359: --- Processing Item: banana ---
360: --- Processing Item: cherry ---
361: --- Aggregating Results ---
362: 
363: Final State: {'items_to_process': ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], 'processed_items': ['Processed_APPLE', 'Processed_BANANA', 'Processed_CHERRY'], 'final_result': 'Processed_APPLE, Processed_BANANA, Processed_CHERRY'}
364: ```
365: 
366: The `dispatch_work` function returned three `Send` objects. The LangGraph engine then scheduled the "worker" node to run three times, each time with a different input dictionary (`{'item': 'apple'}`, `{'item': 'banana'}`, `{'item': 'cherry'}`). The results were automatically collected in `processed_items` thanks to the `operator.add` reducer on our `Annotated` state key. Finally, the `aggregator` ran.
367: 
368: **Internals (`types.py`, `constants.py`)**
369: 
370: *   `Send(node, arg)` is a simple data class defined in `langgraph/types.py`.
371: *   When a node or branch returns `Send` objects, the engine collects them. Internally, these are often associated with a special channel key like `TASKS` (defined in `langgraph/constants.py`).
372: *   The [Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md) processes these `TASKS`. For each `Send(node, arg)`, it schedules the target `node` to run in the *next* step, passing `arg` as its input.
373: *   This allows for dynamic, data-driven invocation of nodes outside the standard edge connections.
374: 
375: ```python
376: # types.py (Simplified view)
377: class Send:
378:     __slots__ = ("node", "arg")
379:     node: str # Target node name
380:     arg: Any  # Data payload for the node
381: 
382:     def __init__(self, /, node: str, arg: Any) -> None:
383:         self.node = node
384:         self.arg = arg
385:     # ... repr, eq, hash ...
386: 
387: # constants.py (Simplified view)
388: TASKS = sys.intern("__pregel_tasks") # Internal key for Send objects
389: 
390: # pregel/algo.py (Conceptual idea during task processing)
391: # if write is for TASKS channel:
392: #   packet = write_value # This is the Send object
393: #   # Schedule packet.node to run in the next step with packet.arg
394: #   schedule_task(node=packet.node, input=packet.arg, ...)
395: ```
396: 
397: ## 3. `Interrupt` - Pausing for Instructions
398: 
399: Sometimes, your graph needs to stop and wait for external input before proceeding. A common case is Human-in-the-Loop (HITL), where an AI agent proposes a plan or an action, and a human needs to approve it.
400: 
401: The `Interrupt` primitive allows a node to pause the graph's execution and wait. This requires a [Checkpointer](06_checkpointer___basecheckpointsaver__.md) to be configured, as the graph needs to save its state to be resumable later.
402: 
403: **How it Works:**
404: 
405: 1.  You import `interrupt` from `langgraph.types`.
406: 2.  Inside a node, you call `interrupt(value_to_send_to_client)`.
407: 3.  This immediately raises a special `GraphInterrupt` exception.
408: 4.  The LangGraph engine catches this, saves the current state using the checkpointer, and returns control to your calling code, often signaling that an interrupt occurred. The `value_to_send_to_client` is included in the information returned.
409: 5.  Later, you can resume the graph execution by providing a value. This is typically done by invoking the compiled graph again with a special `Command(resume=value_for_interrupt)` object (from `langgraph.types`) and the same configuration (including the thread ID for the checkpointer).
410: 6.  When resumed, the graph loads the saved state. The execution engine restarts the *interrupted node from the beginning*. When the code reaches the `interrupt()` call again, instead of raising an exception, it *returns* the `value_for_interrupt` that you provided when resuming. The node then continues executing from that point.
411: 
412: **Example: Human Approval Step**
413: 
414: Let's create a graph where a node plans an action, another node presents it for human approval (using `interrupt`), and a final node executes it if approved.
415: 
416: **Step 1: Define State**
417: 
418: ```python
419: from typing import TypedDict, Optional
420: 
421: class ApprovalState(TypedDict):
422:     plan: str
423:     # We'll use the resume value to implicitly know if approved
424:     feedback: Optional[str] # Store feedback/approval status
425: ```
426: 
427: **Step 2: Define Nodes (including interrupt)**
428: 
429: ```python
430: from langgraph.types import interrupt, Command # Import interrupt and Command
431: 
432: # Node that creates a plan
433: def create_plan(state: ApprovalState) -> dict:
434:     print("--- Creating Plan ---")
435:     plan = "Plan: Execute risky action X."
436:     return {"plan": plan}
437: 
438: # Node that requests human approval using interrupt
439: def request_approval(state: ApprovalState) -> dict:
440:     print("--- Requesting Human Approval ---")
441:     plan = state['plan']
442:     print(f"Proposed Plan: {plan}")
443:     # Call interrupt, passing the plan to the client
444:     # Execution STOPS here on the first run.
445:     feedback_or_approval = interrupt(plan)
446:     # --- Execution RESUMES here on the second run ---
447:     print(f"--- Resumed with feedback: {feedback_or_approval} ---")
448:     # Store the feedback received from the resume command
449:     return {"feedback": str(feedback_or_approval)} # Ensure it's a string
450: 
451: # Node that executes the plan (only if approved implicitly by resuming)
452: def execute_plan(state: ApprovalState) -> dict:
453:     print("--- Executing Plan ---")
454:     if state.get("feedback"): # Check if we got feedback (meaning we resumed)
455:         print(f"Executing '{state['plan']}' based on feedback: {state['feedback']}")
456:         return {} # No state change needed
457:     else:
458:         # This path shouldn't be hit if interrupt works correctly
459:         print("Execution skipped (no feedback received).")
460:         return{}
461: 
462: ```
463: 
464: **Step 3: Build the Graph (with Checkpointer!)**
465: 
466: ```python
467: from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END, START
468: # Need a checkpointer for interrupts!
469: from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
470: 
471: workflow = StateGraph(ApprovalState)
472: 
473: workflow.add_node("planner", create_plan)
474: workflow.add_node("approval_gate", request_approval)
475: workflow.add_node("executor", execute_plan)
476: 
477: workflow.set_entry_point("planner")
478: workflow.add_edge("planner", "approval_gate")
479: workflow.add_edge("approval_gate", "executor") # Runs after interrupt is resolved
480: workflow.add_edge("executor", END)
481: 
482: # Create checkpointer and compile
483: memory_saver = MemorySaver()
484: app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory_saver)
485: ```
486: 
487: **Step 4: Run and Resume**
488: 
489: ```python
490: import uuid
491: 
492: # Unique ID for this conversation thread is needed for the checkpointer
493: config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": str(uuid.uuid4())}}
494: 
495: print("--- Initial Invocation ---")
496: # Start the graph. It should interrupt at the approval node.
497: interrupt_info = None
498: for chunk in app.stream({"plan": ""}, config=config):
499:     print(chunk)
500:     # Check if the chunk contains interrupt information
501:     if "__interrupt__" in chunk:
502:         interrupt_info = chunk["__interrupt__"]
503:         print("\n!! Graph Interrupted !!")
504:         break # Stop processing stream after interrupt
505: 
506: # The client code inspects the interrupt value (the plan)
507: if interrupt_info:
508:     print(f"Interrupt Value (Plan): {interrupt_info[0].value}") # interrupt_info is a tuple
509: 
510:     # --- Simulate human interaction ---
511:     human_decision = "Approved, proceed with caution."
512:     print(f"\n--- Resuming with Decision: '{human_decision}' ---")
513: 
514:     # Resume execution with the human's feedback/approval
515:     # We pass the decision using Command(resume=...)
516:     for chunk in app.stream(Command(resume=human_decision), config=config):
517:          print(chunk)
518: 
519: else:
520:     print("Graph finished without interruption.")
521: ```
522: 
523: **Expected Output:**
524: 
525: ```text
526: --- Initial Invocation ---
527: {'planner': {'plan': 'Plan: Execute risky action X.'}}
528: {'approval_gate': None} # Node starts execution
529: --- Requesting Human Approval ---
530: Proposed Plan: Plan: Execute risky action X.
531: {'__interrupt__': (Interrupt(value='Plan: Execute risky action X.', resumable=True, ns=..., when='during'),)} # Interrupt occurs
532: 
533: !! Graph Interrupted !!
534: Interrupt Value (Plan): Plan: Execute risky action X.
535: 
536: --- Resuming with Decision: 'Approved, proceed with caution.' ---
537: {'approval_gate': {'feedback': 'Approved, proceed with caution.'}} # Node resumes and finishes
538: --- Resumed with feedback: Approved, proceed with caution. ---
539: {'executor': {}} # Executor node runs
540: --- Executing Plan ---
541: Executing 'Plan: Execute risky action X.' based on feedback: Approved, proceed with caution.
542: {'__end__': {'plan': 'Plan: Execute risky action X.', 'feedback': 'Approved, proceed with caution.'}} # Graph finishes
543: ```
544: 
545: The graph paused at `request_approval` after printing the plan. We then resumed it by sending `Command(resume="Approved, proceed with caution.")`. The `request_approval` node restarted, the `interrupt()` call returned our resume value, which was stored in the state, and finally, the `executor` node ran using that feedback.
546: 
547: **Internals (`types.py`, `errors.py`, Checkpointer)**
548: 
549: *   The `interrupt(value)` function (in `langgraph/types.py`) checks if a resume value is available for the current step within the node.
550: *   If no resume value exists (first run), it raises a `GraphInterrupt` exception (`langgraph/errors.py`) containing an `Interrupt` object (`langgraph/types.py`) which holds the `value`.
551: *   The [Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md) catches `GraphInterrupt`.
552: *   If a [Checkpointer](06_checkpointer___basecheckpointsaver__.md) is present, the engine saves the current state (including which node was interrupted) and passes the `Interrupt` object back to the caller.
553: *   When you resume with `Command(resume=resume_value)`, the engine loads the checkpoint.
554: *   It knows which node was interrupted and provides the `resume_value` to it (often via a special `RESUME` entry written to the state channels, managed internally via `PregelScratchpad` in `pregel/algo.py`).
555: *   The node restarts. When `interrupt()` is called again, it finds the `resume_value` (provided via the scratchpad or internal state) and returns it instead of raising an exception.

599: ## Conclusion
600: 
601: You've learned about the essential tools for controlling the flow of execution in your LangGraph applications:
602: 
603: *   **`Branch`** (`add_conditional_edges`): Used to create conditional paths, like `if/else` statements, directing the flow based on the current state. Requires a routing function and often a path map.
604: *   **`Send`**: Used to directly trigger a specific node with specific data, bypassing normal edges. Essential for patterns like map-reduce where you want to invoke the same worker node multiple times with different inputs.
605: *   **`Interrupt`** (`langgraph.types.interrupt`): Used to pause graph execution, typically for human-in-the-loop scenarios. Requires a checkpointer and is resumed using `Command(resume=...)`.
606: 
607: These primitives transform your graph from a simple linear sequence into a dynamic, decision-making process capable of handling complex, real-world workflows.
608: 
609: Now that we understand how nodes execute, how state is managed via channels, and how control flow directs traffic, let's look at the engine that orchestrates all of this behind the scenes.

  8: # Chapter 5: Pregel Execution Engine - The Engine Room
  9: 
 10: In the previous chapters, we learned how to build the blueprint of our application using [`StateGraph`](01_graph___stategraph.md), define the workers with [`Nodes`](02_nodes___pregelnode__.md), manage the shared state with [`Channels`](03_channels.md), and direct the traffic using [Control Flow Primitives](04_control_flow_primitives___branch____send____interrupt__.md).
 11: 
 12: But what actually takes all these pieces – the blueprint, the workers, the communication rules, the traffic signals – and makes them *run*? What ensures Node A runs, its output updates the state correctly via channels, and then Node B (or maybe Node C based on a Branch) runs with that updated state?
 13: 
 14: Meet the **Pregel Execution Engine**. This is the heart of LangGraph, the engine room that drives your graph forward.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Does Pregel Solve?
 17: 
 18: Imagine you've designed a complex assembly line (your `StateGraph`). You have different stations (Nodes) where specific tasks are done, conveyor belts (Channels) moving parts between stations, and switches (Branches) directing parts down different paths.
 19: 
 20: How do you ensure the line runs smoothly? You need a manager! Someone who:
 21: 
 22: 1.  Knows the overall plan (the graph structure).
 23: 2.  Knows which station should work next based on what just finished.
 24: 3.  Delivers the right parts (state) to the right station.
 25: 4.  Collects the finished work from a station.
 26: 5.  Updates the central inventory (the shared state via Channels).
 27: 6.  Deals with decisions (Branches) and special instructions (Sends, Interrupts).
 28: 7.  Handles multiple stations working at the same time if possible (parallelism).
 29: 8.  Keeps track of progress and can save the state (Checkpointing).
 30: 
 31: The **Pregel Execution Engine** is this assembly line manager for your LangGraph application. It takes your compiled graph definition and orchestrates its execution step-by-step.
 32: 
 33: ## Key Concepts: How Pregel Manages the Flow
 34: 
 35: Pregel is inspired by a system developed at Google for processing large graphs. LangGraph adapts these ideas for executing AI agents and multi-step workflows. Here's how it works conceptually:
 36: 
 37: 1.  **Step-by-Step Execution ("Supersteps"):** Pregel runs the graph in discrete steps, often called "supersteps." Think of it like turns in a board game.
 38: 2.  **Scheduling Nodes:** In each step, Pregel looks at the current state and the graph structure (edges, branches) to figure out which [Nodes (`PregelNode`)](02_nodes___pregelnode__.md) should run *in this turn*. This could be the entry point node at the start, nodes triggered by the previous step's output, or nodes activated by a `Send` command.
 39: 3.  **Executing Nodes:** It runs the scheduled nodes. If multiple nodes are scheduled for the same step and they don't directly depend on each other *within that step*, Pregel might run them in parallel using background threads or asyncio tasks.
 40: 4.  **Gathering Updates:** As each node finishes, it returns a dictionary of updates (like `{"value": 6}`). Pregel collects all these updates from all the nodes that ran in the current step.
 41: 5.  **Updating State via Channels:** Pregel takes the collected updates and applies them to the shared state using the appropriate [`Channels`](03_channels.md). For example, it sends `6` to the `"value"` channel, which might overwrite the old value (if it's `LastValue`) or add to it (if it's `BinaryOperatorAggregate`).
 42: 6.  **Looping:** After updating the state, Pregel checks if there are more nodes to run (e.g., nodes connected by edges from the ones that just finished) or if the graph has reached the `END`. If there's more work, it starts the next step (superstep).
 43: 7.  **Handling Control Flow:** It seamlessly integrates [Control Flow Primitives](04_control_flow_primitives___branch____send____interrupt__.md). When a `Branch` needs to run, Pregel executes the routing function and schedules the next node accordingly. When `Send` is used, Pregel schedules the target node with the specific data. When `Interrupt` occurs, Pregel pauses execution (and relies on a [Checkpointer](06_checkpointer___basecheckpointsaver__.md) to save state).
 44: 8.  **Checkpointing:** At configurable points (often after each step), Pregel interacts with the [Checkpointer (`BaseCheckpointSaver`)](06_checkpointer___basecheckpointsaver__.md) to save the current state of all channels. This allows the graph to be paused and resumed later.
 45: 
 46: Essentially, Pregel is the **orchestrator** that manages the entire lifecycle of a graph's execution.
 47: 
 48: ## How Pregel Executes Our Simple Graph
 49: 
 50: Let's revisit the simple `adder -> multiplier` graph from [Chapter 1: Graph / StateGraph](01_graph___stategraph.md) and see how Pregel runs it when you call `app.invoke({"value": 5})`.
 51: 
 52: **Graph:**
 53: 
 54: *   State: `{'value': int}` (uses `LastValue` channel by default)
 55: *   Nodes: `adder` (value+1), `multiplier` (value*2)
 56: *   Edges: `START -> adder`, `adder -> multiplier`, `multiplier -> END`
 57: 
 58: **Execution Flow:**
 59: 
 60: 1.  **Start:** `app.invoke({"value": 5})` is called. The Pregel engine inside the compiled `app` takes over.
 61: 2.  **Initialization:** Pregel sets the initial state in the `"value"` [Channel](03_channels.md) to `5`. `step = 0`.
 62: 3.  **Step 1 Begins:**
 63:     *   **Scheduling:** Pregel sees the edge from `START` to `adder`. It schedules the `adder` node to run in this step.
 64:     *   **Execution:** Pregel retrieves the current state (`{'value': 5}`) from the [Channel](03_channels.md) and runs the `add_one` function associated with the `adder` node.
 65:     *   **Gathering Updates:** The `add_one` function returns `{"value": 6}`. Pregel gathers this write.
 66:     *   **Applying Updates:** Pregel sends the update `6` to the `"value"` [Channel](03_channels.md). Since it's a `LastValue` channel, its state becomes `6`.
 67:     *   **(Checkpointing):** If a checkpointer is configured (and enabled for this step), Pregel saves the state (`{'value': 6}`).
 68:     *   `step` increments to `1`.
 69: 4.  **Step 2 Begins:**
 70:     *   **Scheduling:** Pregel looks at edges originating from nodes that completed in Step 1 (`adder`). It finds the edge `adder -> multiplier`. It schedules the `multiplier` node.
 71:     *   **Execution:** Pregel retrieves the current state (`{'value': 6}`) from the `"value"` [Channel](03_channels.md) and runs the `multiply_by_two` function.
 72:     *   **Gathering Updates:** The `multiply_by_two` function returns `{"value": 12}`. Pregel gathers this write.
 73:     *   **Applying Updates:** Pregel sends the update `12` to the `"value"` [Channel](03_channels.md). The channel's state becomes `12`.
 74:     *   **(Checkpointing):** Pregel saves the state (`{'value': 12}`).
 75:     *   `step` increments to `2`.
 76: 5.  **Step 3 Begins:**
 77:     *   **Scheduling:** Pregel looks at edges from `multiplier`. It finds the edge `multiplier -> END`. Reaching `END` means no more application nodes are scheduled.
 78:     *   **(Execution, Gathering, Applying):** No application nodes run.
 79:     *   **(Checkpointing):** Pregel saves the final state (`{'value': 12}`).
 80: 6.  **Finish:** Pregel detects the `END` state. Execution halts.
 81: 7.  **Return:** The final state (`{'value': 12}`) is read from the channels and returned by `app.invoke()`.
 82: 
 83: **Visualizing the Flow:**

116:     App->>User: Return {'value': 12}
117: ```
118: 
119: Pregel acts as the hidden conductor ensuring each part plays at the right time with the right information.
120: 
121: ## Internal Implementation: A Glimpse Under the Hood
122: 
123: You don't typically interact with the Pregel engine directly; it's encapsulated within the compiled graph object you get from `graph.compile()`. However, understanding its core components helps clarify how LangGraph works. The main logic resides in the `langgraph/pregel/` directory.
124: 
125: 1.  **Compilation:** When you call `graph.compile()`, LangGraph analyzes your nodes, edges, branches, and state schema. It translates your high-level graph definition into an internal representation suitable for the Pregel engine. This includes creating the actual [`PregelNode`](02_nodes___pregelnode__.md) objects which contain information about which channels to read, which function to run, and how to write outputs back.
126: 2.  **The Loop (`pregel/loop.py`):** The core execution happens within a loop (managed by classes like `SyncPregelLoop` or `AsyncPregelLoop`). Each iteration of this loop represents one "superstep".
127: 3.  **Task Preparation (`pregel/algo.py::prepare_next_tasks`):** At the start of each step, this function determines which tasks (nodes) are ready to run. It checks:
128:     *   Which [Channels](03_channels.md) were updated in the previous step.
129:     *   Which nodes are triggered by those updated channels (based on edges and branches).
130:     *   Are there any pending `Send` messages ([Control Flow Primitives](04_control_flow_primitives___branch____send____interrupt__.md)) targeting specific nodes?
131:     *   It uses internal versioning on channels to avoid re-running nodes unnecessarily if their inputs haven't changed.
132: 4.  **Task Execution (`pregel/runner.py::PregelRunner`):** This component takes the list of tasks scheduled for the current step and executes them.
133:     *   It uses an executor (like Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for sync code or `asyncio` for async code) to potentially run independent tasks in parallel.
134:     *   For each task, it reads the required state from the [Channels](03_channels.md), executes the node's function/Runnable, and collects the returned writes (the update dictionary).
135:     *   It handles retries if configured for a node.
136: 5.  **Applying Writes (`pregel/algo.py::apply_writes`):** After tasks in a step complete (or fail), this function gathers all the writes returned by those tasks.
137:     *   It groups writes by channel name.
138:     *   It calls the `.update()` method on each corresponding [Channel](03_channels.md) object, passing the collected updates for that channel. The channel itself enforces its update logic (e.g., `LastValue` overwrites, `Topic` appends).
139:     *   It updates the internal checkpoint state with new channel versions.
140: 6.  **Checkpointing (`pregel/loop.py`, `checkpoint/base.py`):** The loop interacts with the configured [Checkpointer (`BaseCheckpointSaver`)](06_checkpointer___basecheckpointsaver__.md) to save the graph's state (the values and versions of all channels) at appropriate times (e.g., after each step).
141: 7.  **Interrupt Handling (`pregel/loop.py`, `types.py::interrupt`):** If a node calls `interrupt()`, the `PregelRunner` catches the `GraphInterrupt` exception. The `PregelLoop` then coordinates with the [Checkpointer](06_checkpointer___basecheckpointsaver__.md) to save state and pause execution, returning control to the user. Resuming involves loading the checkpoint and providing the resume value back to the waiting `interrupt()` call.
142: 
143: **Simplified Code Snippets:**
144: 
145: *   **Task Preparation (Conceptual):**
146:     ```python
147:     # pregel/algo.py (Simplified Concept)
148:     def prepare_next_tasks(checkpoint, processes, channels, config, step, ...):
149:         tasks = {}
150:         # Check PUSH tasks (from Send)
151:         for packet in checkpoint["pending_sends"]:
152:             # ... create task if node exists ...
153:             task = create_task_for_send(packet, ...)
154:             tasks[task.id] = task
155: 
156:         # Check PULL tasks (from edges/triggers)
157:         for name, proc in processes.items():
158:             # Check if any trigger channel for 'proc' was updated since last seen
159:             if _triggers(channels, checkpoint["channel_versions"], proc):
160:                 # ... read input for the node ...
161:                 task = create_task_for_pull(name, proc, ...)
162:                 tasks[task.id] = task
163:         return tasks
164:     ```
165:     This function checks both explicit `Send` commands and regular node triggers based on updated channels to build the list of tasks for the next step.
166: 
167: *   **Applying Writes (Conceptual):**
168:     ```python
169:     # pregel/algo.py (Simplified Concept)
170:     def apply_writes(checkpoint, channels, tasks: list[PregelExecutableTask], get_next_version):
171:         # ... (sort tasks for determinism, update seen versions) ...
172:         pending_writes_by_channel = defaultdict(list)
173:         for task in tasks:
174:             for chan, val in task.writes: # task.writes is the dict returned by the node
175:                 if chan in channels:
176:                     pending_writes_by_channel[chan].append(val)
177:                 # ... (handle TASKS, PUSH, managed values etc.) ...
178: 
179:         updated_channels = set()
180:         # Apply writes to channels
181:         for chan_name, values_to_update in pending_writes_by_channel.items():
182:             channel_obj = channels[chan_name]
183:             if channel_obj.update(values_to_update): # Channel applies its logic here!
184:                 # If updated, bump the version in the checkpoint
185:                 checkpoint["channel_versions"][chan_name] = get_next_version(...)
186:                 updated_channels.add(chan_name)
187: 
188:         # ... (handle channels that weren't written to but need bumping) ...
189:         return updated_channels
190:     ```
191:     This function takes the results from all nodes in a step and uses the `channel.update()` method to modify the state according to each channel's rules.
192: 
193: *   **The Main Loop (Conceptual):**
194:     ```python
195:     # pregel/loop.py (Simplified Concept - SyncPregelLoop/AsyncPregelLoop)
196:     class PregelLoop:
197:         def run(self): # Simplified invoke/stream logic
198:             with self: # Enters context (loads checkpoint, sets up channels)
199:                 while self.tick(): # tick executes one step
200:                     # Start tasks for the current step using PregelRunner
201:                     runner = PregelRunner(...)
202:                     for _ in runner.tick(self.tasks):
203:                          # Yield control back, allowing writes/outputs to be streamed
204:                          pass # (actual stream logic happens via callbacks)
205:             return self.output # Return final result
206:     ```
207:     The loop repeatedly calls `tick()`. Inside `tick()`, it prepares tasks, runs them using `PregelRunner`, applies the resulting writes, handles checkpoints/interrupts, and determines if another step is needed.
208: 
209: You don't need to know the deep implementation details, but understanding this step-by-step process managed by Pregel helps visualize how your graph comes alive.
210: 
211: ## Conclusion
212: 
213: The **Pregel Execution Engine** is the powerful, yet hidden, coordinator that runs your LangGraph graphs.
214: 
215: *   It executes the graph **step-by-step** (supersteps).
216: *   In each step, it **schedules** which nodes run based on the graph structure and current state.
217: *   It **runs** the nodes (potentially in parallel).
218: *   It **gathers** node outputs and **updates** the shared state using [`Channels`](03_channels.md).
219: *   It seamlessly integrates [`Control Flow Primitives`](04_control_flow_primitives___branch____send____interrupt__.md) like `Branch`, `Send`, and `Interrupt`.
220: *   It works with a [`Checkpointer`](06_checkpointer___basecheckpointsaver__.md) to save and resume state.
221: 
222: Think of it as the engine ensuring your application's logic flows correctly, state is managed reliably, and complex operations are orchestrated smoothly.
223: 
224: We've mentioned checkpointing several times – the ability to save and load the graph's state. This is crucial for long-running processes, human-in-the-loop workflows, and resilience. How does that work?
225: 
226: Let's dive into [Chapter 6: Checkpointer (`BaseCheckpointSaver`)](06_checkpointer___basecheckpointsaver__.md) to understand how LangGraph persists and resumes state.

  8: # Chapter 6: Checkpointer (`BaseCheckpointSaver`) - Saving Your Progress
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 5: Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md), we saw how the engine runs our graph step-by-step. But what happens if a graph takes hours to run, or if it needs to pause and wait for a human? If the program crashes or we need to stop it, do we lose all the progress?
 11: 
 12: That's where **Checkpointers** come to the rescue!
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Do Checkpointers Solve?
 15: 
 16: Imagine you're playing a long video game. You wouldn't want to start from the very beginning every time you stop playing, right? Games have save points or checkpoints that record your progress.
 17: 
 18: LangGraph's **Checkpointer** does the same thing for your graph execution. It automatically saves the graph's state at certain points, usually after each step completed by the [Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md).
 19: 
 20: This is incredibly useful for:
 21: 
 22: 1.  **Long-Running Processes:** If your graph involves many steps or calls to slow tools/LLMs, you can stop it and resume later without losing work.
 23: 2.  **Resilience:** If your program crashes unexpectedly, you can restart it from the last saved checkpoint.
 24: 3.  **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** As we saw with `Interrupt` in [Chapter 4: Control Flow Primitives](04_control_flow_primitives___branch____send____interrupt__.md), pausing the graph requires saving its state so it can be perfectly restored when the human provides input. Checkpointers are essential for this.
 25: 
 26: **Analogy:** Think of a checkpointer as an automatic "Save" button for your graph's progress. It takes snapshots of the shared "whiteboard" ([Channels](03_channels.md)) so you can always pick up where you left off.
 27: 
 28: ## Key Concepts
 29: 
 30: 1.  **What is Saved?** The checkpointer saves the current value and version of every [Channel](03_channels.md) in your graph's state. It also keeps track of which step the graph was on and any pending tasks (like those created by `Send`).
 31: 2.  **When is it Saved?** The [Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md) typically triggers the checkpointer to save after each "superstep" (a round of node executions and state updates).
 32: 3.  **Where is it Saved?** This depends on the specific checkpointer implementation you choose. LangGraph provides several:
 33:     *   `MemorySaver`: Stores checkpoints in your computer's RAM. Simple for testing, but **lost when your script ends**.
 34:     *   `SqliteSaver`: Stores checkpoints in a local SQLite database file, making them persistent across script runs.
 35:     *   Other savers might store checkpoints in cloud databases or other persistent storage.
 36: 4.  **`thread_id` (The Save Slot Name):** To save and load progress correctly, you need a way to identify *which* specific run of the graph you want to work with. Think of this like naming your save file in a game. In LangGraph, this identifier is called the `thread_id`. You provide it in the `config` when you run the graph. Each unique `thread_id` represents an independent "conversation" or execution history.

 38: ## How to Use a Checkpointer
 39: 
 40: Using a checkpointer is straightforward. You just need to tell LangGraph *which* checkpointer to use when you compile your graph.
 41: 
 42: **Step 1: Import a Checkpointer**
 43: 
 44: Let's start with the simplest one, `MemorySaver`.
 45: 
 46: ```python
 47: # Import the simplest checkpointer
 48: from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
 49: ```
 50: 
 51: **Step 2: Instantiate the Checkpointer**
 52: 
 53: ```python
 54: # Create an instance of the memory checkpointer
 55: memory_saver = MemorySaver()
 56: ```
 57: 
 58: **Step 3: Compile Your Graph with the Checkpointer**
 59: 
 60: Let's reuse our simple `adder -> multiplier` graph. The graph definition itself doesn't change.
 61: 
 62: ```python
 63: # --- Define State and Nodes (same as Chapter 1) ---
 64: from typing import TypedDict
 65: from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END, START
 66: 
 67: class MyState(TypedDict):
 68:     value: int
 69: 
 70: def add_one(state: MyState) -> dict:
 71:     print(f"Adder: Adding 1 to {state['value']}")
 72:     return {"value": state['value'] + 1}
 73: 
 74: def multiply_by_two(state: MyState) -> dict:
 75:     print(f"Multiplier: Doubling {state['value']}")
 76:     return {"value": state['value'] * 2}
 77: 
 78: # --- Build the Graph (same as Chapter 1) ---
 79: workflow = StateGraph(MyState)
 80: workflow.add_node("adder", add_one)
 81: workflow.add_node("multiplier", multiply_by_two)
 82: workflow.set_entry_point("adder")
 83: workflow.add_edge("adder", "multiplier")
 84: workflow.add_edge("multiplier", END)
 85: 
 86: # --- Compile WITH the checkpointer ---
 87: # Pass the checkpointer instance to the compile method
 88: app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory_saver)
 89: ```
 90: 
 91: That's it! By passing `checkpointer=memory_saver` to `compile()`, you've enabled automatic checkpointing for this graph.
 92: 
 93: **Step 4: Run with a `thread_id`**
 94: 
 95: To use the checkpointer, you need to provide a configuration dictionary (`config`) containing a unique identifier for this specific execution thread.
 96: 
 97: ```python
 98: import uuid
 99: 
100: # Create a unique ID for this run
101: thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
102: config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": thread_id}}
103: 
104: # Define the initial state
105: initial_state = {"value": 5}
106: 
107: print("--- Running Graph (First Time) ---")
108: # Run the graph with the config
109: final_state = app.invoke(initial_state, config=config)
110: 
111: print("\n--- Final State (First Run) ---")
112: print(final_state)
113: ```
114: 
115: **Expected Output (First Run):**
116: 
117: ```text
118: --- Running Graph (First Time) ---
119: Adder: Adding 1 to 5
120: Multiplier: Doubling 6
121: 
122: --- Final State (First Run) ---
123: {'value': 12}
124: ```
125: 
126: Behind the scenes, `MemorySaver` saved the state after the `adder` step and after the `multiplier` step, associating it with the `thread_id` you provided.
127: 
128: **Step 5: Resume the Graph**
129: 
130: Now, let's imagine we stopped the process. If we run the *same graph* with the *same `thread_id`*, the checkpointer allows the [Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md) to load the last saved state and continue. Since the first run finished completely, running `invoke` again will just load the final state.
131: 
132: ```python
133: print("\n--- Running Graph Again with SAME thread_id ---")
134: # Use the SAME config (containing the same thread_id)
135: # Provide NO initial state, as it will be loaded from the checkpoint
136: resumed_state = app.invoke(None, config=config)
137: 
138: print("\n--- Final State (Resumed Run) ---")
139: print(resumed_state)
140: 
141: # Let's check the saved states using the checkpointer directly
142: print("\n--- Checkpoints Saved ---")
143: for checkpoint in memory_saver.list(config):
144:     print(checkpoint)
145: ```
146: 
147: **Expected Output (Second Run):**
148: 
149: ```text
150: --- Running Graph Again with SAME thread_id ---
151: # Notice: No node printouts because the graph already finished!
152: # It just loads the final saved state.
153: 
154: --- Final State (Resumed Run) ---
155: {'value': 12}
156: 
157: --- Checkpoints Saved ---
158: # You'll see checkpoint objects representing saved states
159: CheckpointTuple(config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '...'}}, checkpoint={'v': 1, 'ts': '...', 'id': '...', 'channel_values': {'value': 6}, 'channel_versions': {'adder': 1}, 'versions_seen': {'adder': {}}}, metadata={'source': 'loop', 'step': 1, ...}, ...)
160: CheckpointTuple(config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '...'}}, checkpoint={'v': 1, 'ts': '...', 'id': '...', 'channel_values': {'value': 12}, 'channel_versions': {'adder': 1, 'multiplier': 2}, 'versions_seen': {'adder': {}, 'multiplier': {'adder': 1}}}, metadata={'source': 'loop', 'step': 2, ...}, ...)
161: CheckpointTuple(config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '...'}}, checkpoint={'v': 1, 'ts': '...', 'id': '...', 'channel_values': {'value': 12}, 'channel_versions': {'adder': 1, 'multiplier': 2}, 'versions_seen': {'adder': {}, 'multiplier': {'adder': 1}}}, metadata={'source': 'loop', 'step': 3, ...}, ...)
162: ```
163: 
164: The checkpointer successfully loaded the final state (`{'value': 12}`) associated with that `thread_id`.
165: 
166: **Checkpointers and `Interrupt` (Human-in-the-Loop)**
167: 
168: Remember the `Interrupt` example from [Chapter 4](04_control_flow_primitives___branch____send____interrupt__.md)?
169: 
170: ```python
171: # (Simplified HITL example from Chapter 4)
172: from langgraph.types import interrupt, Command
173: # ... (State, Nodes: create_plan, request_approval, execute_plan) ...
174: 
175: # Compile WITH checkpointer (REQUIRED for interrupt)
176: memory_saver_hitl = MemorySaver()
177: app_hitl = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory_saver_hitl)
178: 
179: # Run, get interrupted
180: config_hitl = {"configurable": {"thread_id": str(uuid.uuid4())}}
181: for chunk in app_hitl.stream({"plan": ""}, config=config_hitl):
182:     # ... (detect interrupt) ...
183:     print("Graph interrupted!")
184:     break
185: 
186: # Resume after human decision
187: human_decision = "Approved"
188: for chunk in app_hitl.stream(Command(resume=human_decision), config=config_hitl):
189:      # ... (process remaining steps) ...
190:      print("Graph resumed and finished!")
191: ```
192: 
193: When `interrupt()` was called inside the `request_approval` node, the [Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md) automatically used the `memory_saver_hitl` checkpointer to save the *exact state* of the graph at that moment (including the plan). When we called `stream` again with `Command(resume=...)` and the *same* `config_hitl`, the engine loaded that saved state using the checkpointer, allowing the graph to continue exactly where it left off, now with the human's feedback.
194: 
195: **Without a checkpointer, `Interrupt` cannot work.**
196: 
197: ## How Checkpointing Works Internally
198: 
199: What happens behind the scenes when a checkpointer is configured?
200: 
201: **Saving:**
202: 
203: 1.  **Step Complete:** The [Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md) finishes a step (e.g., after running the `adder` node and updating the state).
204: 2.  **Signal Checkpointer:** The engine tells the configured checkpointer (`MemorySaver` in our example) that it's time to save.
205: 3.  **Gather State:** The checkpointer (or the engine on its behalf) accesses all the active [Channels](03_channels.md).
206: 4.  **Serialize State:** For each channel, it calls the channel's internal `checkpoint()` method to get a serializable representation of its current value (e.g., the number `6` for the `"value"` channel).
207: 5.  **Store Checkpoint:** The checkpointer bundles the serialized channel values, their versions, the current step number, and other metadata into a `Checkpoint` object. It then stores this `Checkpoint` associated with the current `thread_id` provided in the `config`. `MemorySaver` stores it in a dictionary in RAM; `SqliteSaver` writes it to a database table.
208: 
209: **Loading (Resuming):**
210: 
211: 1.  **Invoke with `thread_id`:** You call `app.invoke(None, config=config)` where `config` contains a `thread_id` that has been previously saved.
212: 2.  **Request Checkpoint:** The [Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md) asks the checkpointer to load the latest checkpoint for the given `thread_id`.
213: 3.  **Retrieve Checkpoint:** The checkpointer retrieves the saved `Checkpoint` object (e.g., from its memory dictionary or the database).
214: 4.  **Restore State:** The engine takes the saved channel values from the checkpoint. For each channel, it calls the channel's `from_checkpoint()` method (or similar internal logic) to restore its state. The "whiteboard" ([Channels](03_channels.md)) is now exactly as it was when the checkpoint was saved.
215: 5.  **Continue Execution:** The engine looks at the saved step number and metadata to figure out where to resume execution, typically by preparing the tasks for the *next* step.
216:

247: 
248: ## A Peek at the Code (`checkpoint/base.py`, `checkpoint/memory.py`, `pregel/loop.py`)
249: 
250: Let's look at the core components:
251: 
252: *   **`BaseCheckpointSaver` (`checkpoint/base.py`)**: This is the abstract base class (like a template) that all checkpointers must implement. It defines the essential methods the engine needs.
253: 
254:     ```python
255:     # checkpoint/base.py (Highly Simplified)
256:     from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
257:     from typing import Any, Mapping, Optional, Sequence, Tuple, TypedDict
258: 
259:     # Represents a saved checkpoint
260:     class Checkpoint(TypedDict):
261:         channel_values: Mapping[str, Any] # Saved state of channels
262:         channel_versions: Mapping[str, int] # Internal versions
263:         versions_seen: Mapping[str, Mapping[str, int]] # Tracking for node execution
264:         # ... other metadata like v, ts, id, pending_sends ...
265: 
266:     # Represents the checkpoint tuple retrieved from storage
267:     class CheckpointTuple(NamedTuple):
268:         config: dict # The config used (includes thread_id)
269:         checkpoint: Checkpoint
270:         metadata: dict
271:         # ... other fields like parent_config, pending_writes ...
272: 
273:     class BaseCheckpointSaver(ABC):
274:         # --- Sync Methods ---
275:         @abstractmethod
276:         def get_tuple(self, config: dict) -> Optional[CheckpointTuple]:
277:             """Load the checkpoint tuple for the given config."""
278:             ...
279: 
280:         @abstractmethod
281:         def put(self, config: dict, checkpoint: Checkpoint, metadata: dict) -> dict:
282:             """Save a checkpoint."""
283:             ...
284: 
285:         # --- Async Methods (similar structure) ---
286:         @abstractmethod
287:         async def aget_tuple(self, config: dict) -> Optional[CheckpointTuple]:
288:             """Async load the checkpoint tuple."""
289:             ...
290: 
291:         @abstractmethod
292:         async def aput(self, config: dict, checkpoint: Checkpoint, metadata: dict) -> dict:
293:             """Async save a checkpoint."""
294:             ...
295: 
296:         # --- Other methods (list, put_writes) omitted for brevity ---
297:     ```
298:     The key methods are `get_tuple` (to load) and `put` (to save), along with their async counterparts (`aget_tuple`, `aput`). Any specific checkpointer (like `MemorySaver`, `SqliteSaver`) must provide concrete implementations for these methods.
299: 
300: *   **`MemorySaver` (`checkpoint/memory.py`)**: A simple implementation that uses an in-memory dictionary.
301: 
302:     ```python
303:     # checkpoint/memory.py (Highly Simplified)
304:     import threading
305:     from collections import defaultdict
306: 
307:     class MemorySaver(BaseCheckpointSaver):
308:         def __init__(self):
309:             # Use a dictionary to store checkpoints in RAM
310:             # Key: thread_id, Value: List of CheckpointTuples
311:             self._checkpoints: defaultdict[str, list[CheckpointTuple]] = defaultdict(list)
312:             self._lock = threading.RLock() # To handle multiple threads safely
313: 
314:         def get_tuple(self, config: dict) -> Optional[CheckpointTuple]:
315:             thread_id = config["configurable"]["thread_id"]
316:             with self._lock:
317:                 if checkpoints := self._checkpoints.get(thread_id):
318:                     # Return the latest checkpoint for this thread_id
319:                     return checkpoints[-1]
320:                 return None
321: 
322:         def put(self, config: dict, checkpoint: Checkpoint, metadata: dict) -> dict:
323:             thread_id = config["configurable"]["thread_id"]
324:             with self._lock:
325:                 # Append the new checkpoint to the list for this thread_id
326:                 self._checkpoints[thread_id].append(
327:                     CheckpointTuple(config, checkpoint, metadata)
328:                 )
329:             return {"configurable": {"thread_id": thread_id}}
330: 
331:         # ... async methods (aget_tuple, aput) are similar using the same dict ...
332:         # ... list method iterates through the dictionary ...
333:     ```
334:     As you can see, `MemorySaver` just uses a standard Python dictionary (`self._checkpoints`) to store the `CheckpointTuple` for each `thread_id`. This is simple but not persistent.
335: 
336: *   **Integration (`pregel/loop.py`)**: The [Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md) (`PregelLoop` classes) interacts with the checkpointer during its execution cycle.
337: 
338:     ```python
339:     # pregel/loop.py (Conceptual Snippets)
340: 
341:     class PregelLoop: # Base class for Sync/Async loops
342:         def __init__(self, ..., checkpointer: Optional[BaseCheckpointSaver], ...):
343:             self.checkpointer = checkpointer
344:             # ... other init ...
345: 
346:         def _put_checkpoint(self, metadata: CheckpointMetadata) -> None:
347:             # Called by the loop after a step or input processing
348:             if self.checkpointer:
349:                 # 1. Create the Checkpoint object from current channels/state
350:                 checkpoint_data = create_checkpoint(self.checkpoint, self.channels, ...)
351: 
352:                 # 2. Call the checkpointer's put method (sync or async)
353:                 #    (Uses self.submit to potentially run in background)
354:                 self.submit(self.checkpointer.put, self.checkpoint_config, checkpoint_data, metadata)
355: 
356:                 # 3. Update internal config with the new checkpoint ID
357:                 self.checkpoint_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": ..., "checkpoint_id": checkpoint_data["id"]}}
358: 
359:         def __enter__(self): # Or __aenter__ for async
360:             # Called when the loop starts
361:             if self.checkpointer:
362:                 # 1. Try to load an existing checkpoint tuple
363:                 saved = self.checkpointer.get_tuple(self.checkpoint_config)
364:             else:
365:                 saved = None
366: 
367:             if saved:
368:                 # 2. Restore state from the loaded checkpoint
369:                 self.checkpoint = saved.checkpoint
370:                 self.checkpoint_config = saved.config
371:                 # ... restore channels from saved.checkpoint['channel_values'] ...
372:             else:
373:                 # Initialize with an empty checkpoint
374:                 self.checkpoint = empty_checkpoint()
375: 
376:             # ... setup channels based on restored or empty checkpoint ...
377:             return self
378:     ```
379:     The `PregelLoop` uses the checkpointer's `get_tuple` method when it starts (in `__enter__` or `__aenter__`) to load any existing state. It uses the `put` method (inside `_put_checkpoint`) during execution to save progress.
380: 
381: ## Conclusion
382: 
383: You've learned about **Checkpointers (`BaseCheckpointSaver`)**, the mechanism that gives your LangGraph applications memory and resilience.
384: 
385: *   Checkpointers **save** the state of your graph's [Channels](03_channels.md) periodically.
386: *   They **load** saved states to resume execution.
387: *   This is crucial for **long-running graphs**, **human-in-the-loop** workflows (using `Interrupt`), and **recovering from failures**.
388: *   You enable checkpointing by passing a `checkpointer` instance (like `MemorySaver` or `SqliteSaver`) to `graph.compile()`.
389: *   You manage different execution histories using a unique `thread_id` in the `config`.
390: *   `MemorySaver` is simple for testing but lost when the script ends; use database savers (like `SqliteSaver`) for true persistence.
391: 
392: This chapter concludes our tour of the core concepts in LangGraph! You now understand the fundamental building blocks: the blueprint ([`StateGraph`](01_graph___stategraph.md)), the workers ([`Nodes`](02_nodes___pregelnode__.md)), the communication system ([`Channels`](03_channels.md)), the traffic signals ([Control Flow Primitives](04_control_flow_primitives___branch____send____interrupt__.md)), the engine room ([Pregel Execution Engine](05_pregel_execution_engine.md)), and the save system ([Checkpointer](06_checkpointer___basecheckpointsaver__.md)).
393: 
394: With these concepts, you're well-equipped to start building your own sophisticated, stateful applications with LangGraph! Explore the documentation for more examples, advanced patterns, and different checkpointer implementations. Happy building!

  8: # Chapter 1: Table / SSTable & TableCache
  9: 
 10: Welcome to your LevelDB journey! This is the first chapter where we'll start exploring the fundamental building blocks of LevelDB.
 11: 
 12: Imagine you're building a system to store a massive amount of data, like user profiles or product information. You need a way to save this data permanently (so it doesn't disappear when the computer turns off) and retrieve it quickly. How does LevelDB handle this?
 13: 
 14: The core idea we'll explore in this chapter is how LevelDB stores the bulk of its data on disk in special files and how it accesses them efficiently.
 15: 
 16: ## What's the Problem? Storing Lots of Data Permanently
 17: 
 18: Databases need to store key-value pairs (like `user_id` -> `user_data`) persistently. This means writing the data to disk. However, disks are much slower than computer memory (RAM). If we just wrote every tiny change directly to a file, it would be very slow. Also, how do we organize the data on disk so we can find a specific key quickly without reading *everything*?
 19: 
 20: LevelDB's solution involves files called **SSTables** (Sorted String Tables), often just called **Tables** in the code.
 21: 
 22: ## SSTable: The Sorted, Immutable Book on the Shelf
 23: 
 24: Think of an SSTable as a **permanently bound book** in a library.
 25: 
 26: 1.  **Stores Key-Value Pairs:** Just like a dictionary or an encyclopedia volume, an SSTable contains data entries, specifically key-value pairs.
 27: 2.  **Sorted:** The keys inside an SSTable file are always stored in sorted order (like words in a dictionary). This is crucial for finding data quickly later on. If you're looking for the key "zebra", you know you don't need to look in the "A" section.
 28: 3.  **Immutable:** Once an SSTable file is written to disk, LevelDB **never changes it**. It's like a printed book – you can't erase or rewrite a page. If you need to update or delete data, LevelDB writes *new* information in *newer* SSTables. (We'll see how this works in later chapters like [Compaction](08_compaction.md)). This immutability makes many things simpler and safer.
 29: 4.  **It's a File:** At the end of the day, an SSTable is just a file on your computer's disk. LevelDB gives these files names like `000005.ldb` or `000010.sst`.
 30: 
 31: Here's how LevelDB determines the filename for an SSTable:
 32: 
 33: ```c++
 34: // --- File: filename.cc ---
 35: 
 36: // Creates a filename like "dbname/000005.ldb"
 37: std::string TableFileName(const std::string& dbname, uint64_t number) {
 38:   assert(number > 0);
 39:   // Uses a helper to format the number with leading zeros
 40:   // and adds the '.ldb' or '.sst' suffix.
 41:   return MakeFileName(dbname, number, "ldb"); // or "sst"
 42: }
 43: ```
 44: 
 45: This simple function takes the database name (e.g., `/path/to/my/db`) and a unique number and creates the actual filename used on disk. The `.ldb` or `.sst` extension helps identify it as a LevelDB table file.
 46: 
 47: ## Creating SSTables: `BuildTable`
 48: 
 49: How do these sorted, immutable files get created? This happens during processes like "flushing" data from memory or during "compaction" (which we'll cover in later chapters: [MemTable](02_memtable.md) and [Compaction](08_compaction.md)).
 50: 
 51: The function responsible for writing a new SSTable file is `BuildTable`. Think of `BuildTable` as the **printing press and binding machine** for our book analogy. It takes data (often from memory, represented by an `Iterator`) and writes it out to a new, sorted SSTable file on disk.
 52: 
 53: Let's look at a simplified view of `BuildTable`:
 54: 
 55: ```c++
 56: // --- File: builder.cc ---
 57: 
 58: // Builds an SSTable file from the key/value pairs provided by 'iter'.
 59: Status BuildTable(const std::string& dbname, Env* env, const Options& options,
 60:                   TableCache* table_cache, Iterator* iter, FileMetaData* meta) {
 61:   Status s;
 62:   // ... setup: determine filename, open the file for writing ...
 63:   std::string fname = TableFileName(dbname, meta->number);
 64:   WritableFile* file;
 65:   s = env->NewWritableFile(fname, &file);
 66:   // ... handle potential errors ...
 67: 
 68:   // TableBuilder does the heavy lifting of formatting the file
 69:   TableBuilder* builder = new TableBuilder(options, file);
 70: 
 71:   // Find the first key to store as the smallest key in metadata
 72:   iter->SeekToFirst();
 73:   meta->smallest.DecodeFrom(iter->key());
 74: 
 75:   // Loop through all key-value pairs from the input iterator
 76:   Slice key;
 77:   for (; iter->Valid(); iter->Next()) {
 78:     key = iter->key();
 79:     // Add the key and value to the table being built
 80:     builder->Add(key, iter->value());
 81:   }
 82:   // Store the last key as the largest key in metadata
 83:   if (!key.empty()) {
 84:     meta->largest.DecodeFrom(key);
 85:   }
 86: 
 87:   // Finish writing the file (adds index blocks, etc.)
 88:   s = builder->Finish();
 89:   // ... more steps: update metadata, sync file to disk, close file ...
 90:   if (s.ok()) {
 91:       meta->file_size = builder->FileSize();
 92:       s = file->Sync(); // Ensure data is physically written
 93:   }
 94:   if (s.ok()) {
 95:       s = file->Close();
 96:   }
 97:   // ... cleanup: delete builder, file; handle errors ...
 98: 
 99:   return s;
100: }
101: ```
102: 
103: **Explanation:**
104: 
105: 1.  **Input:** `BuildTable` receives data via an `Iterator`. An iterator is like a cursor that lets you go through key-value pairs one by one, already in sorted order. It also gets other necessary info like the database name (`dbname`), environment (`env`), options, the `TableCache` (we'll see this next!), and a `FileMetaData` object to store information *about* the new file (like its number, size, smallest key, and largest key).
106: 2.  **File Creation:** It creates a new, empty file using `env->NewWritableFile`.
107: 3.  **TableBuilder:** It uses a helper object called `TableBuilder` to handle the complex details of formatting the SSTable file structure (data blocks, index blocks, etc.).
108: 4.  **Iteration & Adding:** It loops through the `Iterator`. For each key-value pair, it calls `builder->Add()`. Because the input `Iterator` provides keys in sorted order, the `TableBuilder` can write them sequentially to the file.
109: 5.  **Metadata:** It records the very first key (`meta->smallest`) and the very last key (`meta->largest`) it processes. This is useful later for quickly knowing the range of keys stored in this file without opening it.
110: 6.  **Finishing Up:** It calls `builder->Finish()` to write out the final pieces of the SSTable (like the index). Then it `Sync`s the file to ensure the data is safely on disk and `Close`s it.
111: 7.  **Output:** If successful, a new `.ldb` file exists on disk containing the sorted key-value pairs, and the `meta` object is filled with details about this file.
112: 
113: ## Accessing SSTables Efficiently: `TableCache`
114: 
115: Okay, so we have these SSTable files on disk. But reading from disk is slow. If we need to read from the same SSTable file multiple times (which is common), opening and closing it repeatedly, or re-reading its internal index structure, would be inefficient.
116: 
117: This is where the `TableCache` comes in. Think of the `TableCache` as a **smart librarian**.
118: 
119: 1.  **Keeps Files Open:** The librarian might keep the most popular books near the front desk instead of running to the far shelves every time someone asks for them. Similarly, the `TableCache` keeps recently used SSTable files open.
120: 2.  **Caches Structures:** Just opening the file isn't enough. LevelDB needs to read some index information *within* the SSTable file to find keys quickly. The `TableCache` also keeps this parsed information in memory (RAM). It uses a specific caching strategy called LRU (Least Recently Used) to decide which table information to keep in memory if the cache gets full.
121: 3.  **Provides Access:** When LevelDB needs to read data from a specific SSTable (identified by its file number), it asks the `TableCache`. The cache checks if it already has that table open and ready in memory. If yes (a "cache hit"), it returns access quickly. If no (a "cache miss"), it opens the actual file from disk, reads the necessary index info, stores it in the cache for next time, and then returns access.
122: 
123: Let's see how the `TableCache` finds a table:
124: 
125: ```c++
126: // --- File: table_cache.cc ---
127: 
128: // Tries to find the Table structure for a given file number.
129: // If not in cache, opens the file and loads it.
130: Status TableCache::FindTable(uint64_t file_number, uint64_t file_size,
131:                              Cache::Handle** handle) {
132:   Status s;
133:   // Create a key for the cache lookup (based on file number)
134:   char buf[sizeof(file_number)];
135:   EncodeFixed64(buf, file_number);
136:   Slice key(buf, sizeof(buf));
137: 
138:   // 1. Try looking up the table in the cache
139:   *handle = cache_->Lookup(key);
140: 
141:   if (*handle == nullptr) { // Cache Miss!
142:     // 2. If not found, open the actual file from disk
143:     std::string fname = TableFileName(dbname_, file_number);
144:     RandomAccessFile* file = nullptr;
145:     Table* table = nullptr;
146:     s = env_->NewRandomAccessFile(fname, &file); // Open the file
147:     // ... handle errors, potentially check for old .sst filename ...
148: 
149:     if (s.ok()) {
150:       // 3. Parse the Table structure (index etc.) from the file
151:       s = Table::Open(options_, file, file_size, &table);
152:     }
153: 
154:     if (s.ok()) {
155:       // 4. Store the opened file and parsed Table in the cache
156:       TableAndFile* tf = new TableAndFile;
157:       tf->file = file;
158:       tf->table = table;
159:       *handle = cache_->Insert(key, tf, 1 /*charge*/, &DeleteEntry);
160:     } else {
161:       // Error occurred, cleanup
162:       delete file;
163:       // Note: Errors are NOT cached. We'll retry opening next time.
164:     }
165:   } // else: Cache Hit! *handle is already valid.
166:   return s;
167: }
168: ```
169: 
170: **Explanation:**
171: 
172: 1.  **Lookup:** It first tries `cache_->Lookup` using the `file_number`.
173: 2.  **Cache Miss:** If `Lookup` returns `nullptr`, it means the table isn't in the cache. It then proceeds to open the file (`env_->NewRandomAccessFile`).
174: 3.  **Table::Open:** It calls `Table::Open`, which reads the file's footer, parses the index block, and sets up a `Table` object ready for lookups.
175: 4.  **Insert:** If opening and parsing succeed, it creates a `TableAndFile` struct (holding both the file handle and the `Table` object) and inserts it into the cache using `cache_->Insert`. Now, the next time `FindTable` is called for this `file_number`, it will be a cache hit.
176: 5.  **Cache Hit:** If `Lookup` initially returned a valid handle, `FindTable` simply returns `Status::OK()`, and the caller can use the handle to get the `Table` object.
177: 
178: When LevelDB needs to read data, it often gets an `Iterator` for a specific SSTable via the `TableCache`:
179: 
180: ```c++
181: // --- File: table_cache.cc ---
182: 
183: // Returns an iterator for reading the specified SSTable file.
184: Iterator* TableCache::NewIterator(const ReadOptions& options,
185:                                   uint64_t file_number, uint64_t file_size,
186:                                   Table** tableptr) {
187:   // ... setup ...
188:   Cache::Handle* handle = nullptr;
189:   // Use FindTable to get the Table object (from cache or by opening file)
190:   Status s = FindTable(file_number, file_size, &handle);
191:   if (!s.ok()) {
192:     return NewErrorIterator(s); // Return an iterator that yields the error
193:   }
194: 
195:   // Get the Table object from the cache handle
196:   Table* table = reinterpret_cast<TableAndFile*>(cache_->Value(handle))->table;
197:   // Ask the Table object to create a new iterator for its data
198:   Iterator* result = table->NewIterator(options);
199: 
200:   // Important: Register cleanup to release the cache handle when iterator is done
201:   result->RegisterCleanup(&UnrefEntry, cache_, handle);
202: 
203:   // Optionally return the Table object itself
204:   if (tableptr != nullptr) {
205:     *tableptr = table;
206:   }
207:   return result;
208: }
209: ```
210: 
211: This function uses `FindTable` to get the `Table` object (either from the cache or by loading it from disk) and then asks that `Table` object to provide an `Iterator` to step through its key-value pairs. It also cleverly registers a cleanup function (`UnrefEntry`) so that when the iterator is no longer needed, the cache handle is released, allowing the cache to potentially evict the table later if needed.
212: 
213: Here's a diagram showing how a read might use the `TableCache`:

241:     end
242: ```
243: 
244: ## Conclusion
245: 
246: In this chapter, we learned about two fundamental concepts in LevelDB:
247: 
248: 1.  **SSTable (Table):** These are the immutable, sorted files on disk where LevelDB stores the bulk of its key-value data. Think of them as sorted, bound books. They are created using `BuildTable`.
249: 2.  **TableCache:** This acts like an efficient librarian for SSTables. It keeps recently used tables open and their index structures cached in memory (RAM) to speed up access, avoiding slow disk reads whenever possible. It provides access to table data, often via iterators.
250: 
251: These two components work together to provide persistent storage and relatively fast access to the data within those files.
252: 
253: But where does the data *come from* before it gets written into an SSTable? Often, it lives in memory first. In the next chapter, we'll look at the in-memory structure where recent writes are held before being flushed to an SSTable.
254:

  8: # Chapter 2: MemTable
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: Table / SSTable & TableCache](01_table___sstable___tablecache.md), we learned how LevelDB stores the bulk of its data permanently on disk in sorted, immutable files called SSTables. We also saw how the `TableCache` helps access these files efficiently.
 11: 
 12: But imagine you're updating your data frequently – adding new users, changing scores, deleting temporary items. Writing every tiny change directly to a new SSTable file on disk would be incredibly slow, like carving every single note onto a stone tablet! We need a faster way to handle recent changes.
 13: 
 14: ## What's the Problem? Slow Disk Writes for Every Change
 15: 
 16: Disk drives (even fast SSDs) are much slower than your computer's main memory (RAM). If LevelDB wrote every `Put` or `Delete` operation straight to an SSTable file, your application would constantly be waiting for the disk, making it feel sluggish.
 17: 
 18: How can we accept new writes quickly but still eventually store them permanently on disk?
 19: 
 20: ## MemTable: The Fast In-Memory Notepad
 21: 
 22: LevelDB's solution is the **MemTable**. Think of it as a **temporary notepad** or a **scratchpad** that lives entirely in your computer's fast RAM.
 23: 
 24: 1.  **In-Memory:** It's stored in RAM, making reads and writes extremely fast.
 25: 2.  **Holds Recent Writes:** When you `Put` a new key-value pair or `Delete` a key, the change goes into the MemTable first.
 26: 3.  **Sorted:** Just like SSTables, the data inside the MemTable is kept sorted by key. This is important for efficiency later.
 27: 4.  **Temporary:** It's only a temporary holding area. Eventually, its contents get written out to a permanent SSTable file on disk.
 28: 
 29: So, when you write data:
 30: 
 31: *Your Application* -> `Put("user123", "data")` -> **MemTable** (Fast RAM write!)
 32: 
 33: This makes write operations feel almost instantaneous to your application.
 34: 
 35: ## How Reads Use the MemTable
 36: 
 37: When you try to read data using `Get(key)`, LevelDB is smart. It knows the most recent data might still be on the "notepad" (MemTable). So, it checks there *first*:
 38: 
 39: 1.  **Check MemTable:** Look for the key in the current MemTable.
 40:     *   If the key is found, return the value immediately (super fast!).
 41:     *   If a "deletion marker" for the key is found, stop and report "Not Found" (the key was recently deleted).
 42: 2.  **Check Older MemTable (Immutable):** If there's an older MemTable being flushed (we'll cover this next), check that too.
 43: 3.  **Check SSTables:** If the key wasn't found in memory (or wasn't deleted there), *then* LevelDB looks for it in the SSTable files on disk, using the [Table / SSTable & TableCache](01_table___sstable___tablecache.md) we learned about in Chapter 1.
 44: 
 45: This "check memory first" strategy ensures that you always read the most up-to-date value, even if it hasn't hit the disk yet.

 81: ## What Happens When the Notepad Fills Up?
 82: 
 83: The MemTable lives in RAM, which is limited. We can't just keep adding data to it forever. LevelDB has a configured size limit for the MemTable ( `options.write_buffer_size`, often a few megabytes).
 84: 
 85: When the MemTable gets close to this size:
 86: 
 87: 1.  **Freeze!** LevelDB declares the current MemTable "immutable" (meaning read-only). No new writes go into this specific MemTable anymore. Let's call it `imm_` (Immutable MemTable).
 88: 2.  **New Notepad:** LevelDB immediately creates a *new*, empty MemTable (`mem_`) to accept incoming writes. Your application doesn't pause; new writes just start going to the fresh MemTable.
 89: 3.  **Flush to Disk:** A background task starts working on the frozen `imm_`. It reads all the sorted key-value pairs from `imm_` and uses the `BuildTable` process (from [Chapter 1](01_table___sstable___tablecache.md)) to write them into a brand new SSTable file on disk. This new file becomes part of "Level-0" (we'll learn more about levels in [Chapter 8: Compaction](08_compaction.md)).
 90: 4.  **Discard:** Once the `imm_` is successfully written to the SSTable file, the in-memory `imm_` is discarded, freeing up RAM.
 91: 
 92: This process ensures that writes are always fast (going to the *new* `mem_`) while the *old* data is efficiently flushed to disk in the background.

116: ## Under the Hood: Keeping it Sorted with a SkipList
117: 
118: We mentioned that the MemTable keeps keys sorted. Why?
119: 
120: 1.  **Efficient Flushing:** When flushing the MemTable to an SSTable, the data needs to be written in sorted order. If the MemTable is already sorted, this is very efficient – we just read through it sequentially.
121: 2.  **Efficient Reads:** Keeping it sorted allows for faster lookups within the MemTable itself.
122: 
123: How does LevelDB keep the MemTable sorted while allowing fast inserts? It uses a clever data structure called a **SkipList**.
124: 
125: Imagine a sorted linked list. To find an element, you might have to traverse many nodes. Now, imagine adding some "express lanes" (higher-level links) that skip over several nodes at a time. You can use these express lanes to quickly get close to your target, then drop down to the detailed level (the base list) to find the exact spot. This is the core idea of a SkipList!
126: 
127: *   **Fast Inserts:** Adding a new item is generally fast.
128: *   **Fast Lookups:** Finding an item is much faster than a simple linked list, often close to the speed of more complex balanced trees.
129: *   **Efficient Iteration:** Reading all items in sorted order (needed for flushing) is straightforward.
130: 
131: The MemTable essentially wraps a SkipList provided by `skiplist.h`.
132: 
133: ```c++
134: // --- File: db/memtable.h ---
135: 
136: #include "db/skiplist.h" // The SkipList data structure
137: #include "util/arena.h"   // Memory allocator
138: 
139: class MemTable {
140:  private:
141:   // The core data structure: a SkipList.
142:   // The Key is 'const char*' pointing into the Arena.
143:   // KeyComparator helps compare keys correctly (we'll see this later).
144:   typedef SkipList<const char*, KeyComparator> Table;
145: 
146:   Arena arena_;   // Allocates memory for nodes efficiently
147:   Table table_;   // The actual SkipList instance
148:   int refs_;      // Reference count for managing lifetime
149:   // ... other members like KeyComparator ...
150: 
151:  public:
152:   // Add an entry (Put or Delete marker)
153:   void Add(SequenceNumber seq, ValueType type, const Slice& key,
154:            const Slice& value);
155: 
156:   // Look up a key
157:   bool Get(const LookupKey& key, std::string* value, Status* s);
158: 
159:   // Create an iterator to scan the MemTable's contents
160:   Iterator* NewIterator();
161: 
162:   // Estimate memory usage
163:   size_t ApproximateMemoryUsage();
164: 
165:   // Constructor, Ref/Unref omitted for brevity...
166: };
167: ```
168: 
169: This header shows the `MemTable` class uses an `Arena` for memory management and a `Table` (which is a `SkipList`) to store the data.
170: 
171: ## Adding and Getting Data (Code View)
172: 
173: Let's look at simplified versions of `Add` and `Get`.
174: 
175: **Adding an Entry:**
176: 
177: When you call `db->Put(key, value)` or `db->Delete(key)`, it eventually calls `MemTable::Add`.
178: 
179: ```c++
180: // --- File: db/memtable.cc ---
181: 
182: void MemTable::Add(SequenceNumber s, ValueType type, const Slice& key,
183:                    const Slice& value) {
184:   // Calculate size needed for the entry in the skiplist.
185:   // Format includes key size, key, sequence number + type tag, value size, value.
186:   size_t key_size = key.size();
187:   size_t val_size = value.size();
188:   size_t internal_key_size = key_size + 8; // 8 bytes for seq + type
189:   const size_t encoded_len = VarintLength(internal_key_size) +
190:                              internal_key_size + VarintLength(val_size) +
191:                              val_size;
192: 
193:   // Allocate memory from the Arena
194:   char* buf = arena_.Allocate(encoded_len);
195: 
196:   // Encode the entry into the buffer 'buf' (details omitted)
197:   // Format: [key_len][key_bytes][seq_num|type][value_len][value_bytes]
198:   // ... encoding logic ...
199: 
200:   // Insert the buffer pointer into the SkipList. The SkipList uses the
201:   // KeyComparator to know how to sort based on the encoded format.
202:   table_.Insert(buf);
203: }
204: ```
205: 
206: **Explanation:**
207: 
208: 1.  **Calculate Size:** Determines how much memory is needed to store the key, value, sequence number, and type. (We'll cover sequence numbers and internal keys in [Chapter 9](09_internalkey___dbformat.md)).
209: 2.  **Allocate:** Gets a chunk of memory from the `Arena`. Arenas are efficient allocators for many small objects with similar lifetimes.
210: 3.  **Encode:** Copies the key, value, and metadata into the allocated buffer (`buf`).
211: 4.  **Insert:** Calls `table_.Insert(buf)`, where `table_` is the SkipList. The SkipList takes care of finding the correct sorted position and linking the new entry.
212: 
213: **Getting an Entry:**
214: 
215: When you call `db->Get(key)`, it checks the MemTable first using `MemTable::Get`.
216: 
217: ```c++
218: // --- File: db/memtable.cc ---
219: 
220: bool MemTable::Get(const LookupKey& lkey, std::string* value, Status* s) {
221:   // Get the specially formatted key to search for in the MemTable.
222:   Slice memkey = lkey.memtable_key();
223: 
224:   // Create an iterator for the SkipList.
225:   Table::Iterator iter(&table_);
226: 
227:   // Seek to the first entry >= the key we are looking for.
228:   iter.Seek(memkey.data());
229: 
230:   if (iter.Valid()) { // Did we find something at or after our key?
231:     // Decode the key found in the SkipList
232:     const char* entry = iter.key();
233:     // ... decode logic to get user_key, sequence, type ...
234:     Slice found_user_key = /* decoded user key */;
235:     ValueType found_type = /* decoded type */;
236: 
237:     // Check if the user key matches exactly
238:     if (comparator_.comparator.user_comparator()->Compare(
239:             found_user_key, lkey.user_key()) == 0) {
240:       // It's the right key! Check the type.
241:       if (found_type == kTypeValue) { // Is it a Put record?
242:         // Decode the value and return it
243:         Slice v = /* decoded value */;
244:         value->assign(v.data(), v.size());
245:         return true; // Found the value!
246:       } else { // Must be kTypeDeletion
247:         // Found a deletion marker for this key. Report "NotFound".
248:         *s = Status::NotFound(Slice());
249:         return true; // Found a deletion!
250:       }
251:     }
252:   }
253:   // Key not found in this MemTable
254:   return false;
255: }
256: ```
257: 
258: **Explanation:**
259: 
260: 1.  **Get Search Key:** Prepares the key in the format used internally by the MemTable (`LookupKey`).
261: 2.  **Create Iterator:** Gets a `SkipList::Iterator`.
262: 3.  **Seek:** Uses the iterator's `Seek` method to efficiently find the first entry in the SkipList whose key is greater than or equal to the search key.
263: 4.  **Check Found Entry:** If `Seek` finds an entry (`iter.Valid()`):
264:     *   It decodes the entry found in the SkipList.
265:     *   It compares the *user* part of the key to ensure it's an exact match (not just the next key in sorted order).
266:     *   If the keys match, it checks the `type`:
267:         *   If it's `kTypeValue`, it decodes the value and returns `true`.
268:         *   If it's `kTypeDeletion`, it sets the status to `NotFound` and returns `true` (indicating we found definitive information about the key – it's deleted).
269: 5.  **Not Found:** If no matching key is found, it returns `false`.
270: 
271: ## Conclusion
272: 
273: The **MemTable** is LevelDB's crucial in-memory cache for recent writes. It acts like a fast notepad:
274: 
275: *   Accepts new `Put` and `Delete` operations quickly in RAM.
276: *   Keeps entries sorted using an efficient **SkipList**.
277: *   Allows recent data to be read quickly without touching the disk.
278: *   When full, it's frozen, flushed to a new Level-0 **SSTable** file on disk in the background, and then discarded.
279: 
280: This design allows LevelDB to provide very fast write performance while still ensuring data is eventually persisted safely to disk.
281: 
282: However, what happens if the power goes out *after* data is written to the MemTable but *before* it's flushed to an SSTable? Isn't the data in RAM lost? To solve this, LevelDB uses another component alongside the MemTable: the Write-Ahead Log (WAL).

  8: # Chapter 3: Write-Ahead Log (WAL) & LogWriter/LogReader
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 2: MemTable](02_memtable.md), we saw how LevelDB uses an in-memory `MemTable` (like a fast notepad) to quickly accept new writes (`Put` or `Delete`) before they are eventually flushed to an [SSTable](01_table___sstable___tablecache.md) file on disk.
 11: 
 12: This is great for speed! But what if the unthinkable happens? Imagine you've just written some important data. It's sitting safely in the `MemTable` in RAM, but *before* LevelDB gets a chance to write it to a permanent SSTable file, the power cord gets kicked out, or the server crashes!
 13: 
 14: Uh oh. Since RAM is volatile, anything in the `MemTable` that hadn't been saved to disk is **gone** forever when the power goes out. That's not very reliable for a database!
 15: 
 16: ## What's the Problem? Losing Data on Crashes
 17: 
 18: How can LevelDB make sure that once your write operation *returns successfully*, the data is safe, even if the system crashes immediately afterwards? Relying only on the `MemTable` isn't enough because it lives in volatile RAM. We need a way to make writes durable (permanent) much sooner.
 19: 
 20: ## Write-Ahead Log (WAL): The Database's Safety Journal
 21: 
 22: LevelDB's solution is the **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**, often just called the **log**.
 23: 
 24: Think of the WAL as a **ship's logbook** or a **court reporter's transcript**.
 25: 
 26: 1.  **Write First:** Before the captain takes any significant action (like changing course), they write it down in the logbook *first*. Similarly, before LevelDB modifies the `MemTable` (which is in RAM), it **first appends** a description of the change (e.g., "Put key 'user1' with value 'dataA'") to a special file on disk – the WAL file.
 27: 2.  **Append-Only:** Like a logbook, entries are just added sequentially to the end. LevelDB doesn't go back and modify old entries in the current WAL file. This makes writing very fast – it's just adding to the end of a file.
 28: 3.  **On Disk:** Crucially, this WAL file lives on the persistent disk (HDD or SSD), not just in volatile RAM.
 29: 4.  **Durability:** By writing to the WAL *before* acknowledging a write to the user, LevelDB ensures that even if the server crashes immediately after, the record of the operation is safely stored on disk in the log.
 30: 
 31: So, the write process looks like this:
 32: 
 33: *Your Application* -> `Put("user123", "data")` -> **1. Append to WAL file (Disk)** -> **2. Add to MemTable (RAM)** -> *Return Success*
 34: 
 35: ```mermaid
 36: sequenceDiagram
 37:     participant App as Application
 38:     participant LevelDB
 39:     participant WAL as WAL File (Disk)
 40:     participant MemTable as MemTable (RAM)
 41: 
 42:     App->>LevelDB: Put("key", "value")
 43:     LevelDB->>WAL: Append Put("key", "value") Record
 44:     Note right of WAL: Physical disk write
 45:     WAL-->>LevelDB: Append successful
 46:     LevelDB->>MemTable: Add("key", "value")
 47:     MemTable-->>LevelDB: Add successful
 48:     LevelDB-->>App: Write successful
 49: ```
 50: 
 51: This "write-ahead" step ensures durability.
 52: 
 53: ## What Happens During Recovery? Replaying the Logbook
 54: 
 55: Now, let's say the server crashes and restarts. LevelDB needs to recover its state. How does the WAL help?
 56: 
 57: 1.  **Check for Log:** When LevelDB starts up, it looks for a WAL file.
 58: 2.  **Read the Log:** If a WAL file exists, it means the database might not have shut down cleanly, and the last `MemTable`'s contents (which were only in RAM) were lost. LevelDB creates a `LogReader` to read through the WAL file from beginning to end.
 59: 3.  **Rebuild MemTable:** For each operation record found in the WAL (like "Put key 'user1' value 'dataA'", "Delete key 'user2'"), LevelDB re-applies that operation to a *new*, empty `MemTable` in memory. It's like rereading the ship's logbook to reconstruct what happened right before the incident.
 60: 4.  **Recovery Complete:** Once the entire WAL is replayed, the `MemTable` is back to the state it was in right before the crash. LevelDB can now continue operating normally, accepting new reads and writes. The data from the WAL is now safely in the new `MemTable`, ready to be flushed to an SSTable later.
 61: 
 62: The WAL file essentially acts as a temporary backup for the `MemTable` until the `MemTable`'s contents are permanently stored in an SSTable. Once a `MemTable` is successfully flushed to an SSTable, the corresponding WAL file is no longer needed and can be deleted.
 63: 
 64: ## LogWriter: Appending to the Log
 65: 
 66: The component responsible for writing records to the WAL file is `log::Writer`. Think of it as the dedicated writer making entries in our ship's logbook.
 67: 
 68: When LevelDB processes a write operation (often coming from a [WriteBatch](05_writebatch.md), which we'll see later), it serializes the batch of changes into a single chunk of data (a `Slice`) and asks the `log::Writer` to add it to the current log file.
 69: 
 70: ```c++
 71: // --- Simplified from db/db_impl.cc ---
 72: // Inside DBImpl::Write(...) after preparing the batch:
 73: 
 74: Status status = log_->AddRecord(WriteBatchInternal::Contents(write_batch));
 75: // ... check status ...
 76: if (status.ok() && options.sync) {
 77:   // Optionally ensure the data hits the physical disk
 78:   status = logfile_->Sync();
 79: }
 80: if (status.ok()) {
 81:   // Only if WAL write succeeded, apply to MemTable
 82:   status = WriteBatchInternal::InsertInto(write_batch, mem_);
 83: }
 84: // ... handle status ...
 85: ```
 86: 
 87: **Explanation:**
 88: 
 89: 1.  `WriteBatchInternal::Contents(write_batch)`: Gets the serialized representation of the write operations (like one or more Puts/Deletes).
 90: 2.  `log_->AddRecord(...)`: Calls the `log::Writer` instance (`log_`) to append this serialized data as a single record to the current WAL file (`logfile_`).
 91: 3.  `logfile_->Sync()`: If the `sync` option is set (which is the default for ensuring durability), this command tells the operating system to *really* make sure the data written to the log file has reached the physical disk platters/flash, not just sitting in some OS buffer. This is crucial for surviving power loss.
 92: 4.  `WriteBatchInternal::InsertInto(write_batch, mem_)`: Only *after* the log write is confirmed (and synced, if requested) does LevelDB apply the changes to the in-memory `MemTable`.
 93: 
 94: The `log::Writer` itself handles the details of how records are actually formatted within the log file. Log files are composed of fixed-size blocks (e.g., 32KB). A single record from `AddRecord` might be small enough to fit entirely within the remaining space in the current block, or it might be large and need to be split (fragmented) across multiple physical records spanning block boundaries.
 95: 
 96: ```c++
 97: // --- Simplified from db/log_writer.cc ---
 98: 
 99: Status Writer::AddRecord(const Slice& slice) {
100:   const char* ptr = slice.data();
101:   size_t left = slice.size(); // How much data is left to write?
102:   Status s;
103:   bool begin = true; // Is this the first fragment of this record?
104: 
105:   do {
106:     const int leftover = kBlockSize - block_offset_; // Space left in current block
107:     // ... if leftover < kHeaderSize, fill trailer and start new block ...
108: 
109:     // Calculate how much of the data can fit in this block
110:     const size_t avail = kBlockSize - block_offset_ - kHeaderSize;
111:     const size_t fragment_length = (left < avail) ? left : avail;
112: 
113:     // Determine the type of this physical record (fragment)
114:     RecordType type;
115:     const bool end = (left == fragment_length); // Is this the last fragment?
116:     if (begin && end) {
117:       type = kFullType;     // Fits entirely in one piece
118:     } else if (begin) {
119:       type = kFirstType;    // First piece of a multi-piece record
120:     } else if (end) {
121:       type = kLastType;     // Last piece of a multi-piece record
122:     } else {
123:       type = kMiddleType;   // Middle piece of a multi-piece record
124:     }
125: 
126:     // Write this physical record (header + data fragment) to the file
127:     s = EmitPhysicalRecord(type, ptr, fragment_length);
128: 
129:     // Advance pointers and update remaining size
130:     ptr += fragment_length;
131:     left -= fragment_length;
132:     begin = false; // Subsequent fragments are not the 'begin' fragment
133: 
134:   } while (s.ok() && left > 0); // Loop until all data is written or error
135:   return s;
136: }
137: 
138: // Simplified - Writes header (checksum, length, type) and payload
139: Status Writer::EmitPhysicalRecord(RecordType t, const char* ptr, size_t length) {
140:   // ... format header (buf) with checksum, length, type ...
141:   // ... compute checksum ...
142:   // ... Encode checksum into header ...
143: 
144:   // Write header and payload fragment
145:   Status s = dest_->Append(Slice(buf, kHeaderSize));
146:   if (s.ok()) {
147:     s = dest_->Append(Slice(ptr, length));
148:     // LevelDB might Flush() here or let the caller Sync() later
149:   }
150:   block_offset_ += kHeaderSize + length; // Update position in current block
151:   return s;
152: }
153: ```
154: 
155: **Explanation:**
156: 
157: *   The `AddRecord` method takes the user's data (`slice`) and potentially breaks it into smaller `fragment_length` chunks.
158: *   Each chunk is written as a "physical record" using `EmitPhysicalRecord`.
159: *   `EmitPhysicalRecord` prepends a small header (`kHeaderSize`, 7 bytes) containing a checksum (for detecting corruption), the length of this fragment, and the `RecordType` (`kFullType`, `kFirstType`, `kMiddleType`, or `kLastType`).
160: *   The `RecordType` tells the `LogReader` later how to reassemble these fragments back into the original complete record.
161: 
162: ## LogReader: Reading the Log for Recovery
163: 
164: The counterpart to `LogWriter` is `log::Reader`. This is the component used during database startup (recovery) to read the records back from a WAL file. Think of it as the person carefully reading the ship's logbook after an incident.
165: 
166: The `log::Reader` reads the log file sequentially, block by block. It parses the physical record headers, verifies checksums, and pieces together the fragments (`kFirstType`, `kMiddleType`, `kLastType`) to reconstruct the original data records that were passed to `AddRecord`.
167: 
168: ```c++
169: // --- Simplified from db/db_impl.cc ---
170: // Inside DBImpl::RecoverLogFile(...)
171: 
172: // Create the log reader for the specific log file number
173: std::string fname = LogFileName(dbname_, log_number);
174: SequentialFile* file;
175: Status status = env_->NewSequentialFile(fname, &file);
176: // ... check status ...
177: 
178: // Set up reporter for corruption errors
179: log::Reader::Reporter reporter;
180: // ... initialize reporter ...
181: log::Reader reader(file, &reporter, true /*checksum*/, 0 /*initial_offset*/);

216: delete file; // Close the log file
217: // ... handle final MemTable (mem) if not null ...
218: ```
219: 
220: **Explanation:**
221: 
222: 1.  A `log::Reader` is created, pointing to the WAL file (`.log`) that needs recovery.
223: 2.  The code loops using `reader.ReadRecord(&record, &scratch)`.
224:     *   `record`: This `Slice` will point to the reassembled data of the next complete logical record found in the log.
225:     *   `scratch`: A temporary string buffer the reader might use if a record spans multiple blocks.
226: 3.  Inside the loop:
227:     *   The `record` (which contains a serialized `WriteBatch`) is parsed back into a `WriteBatch` object.
228:     *   `WriteBatchInternal::InsertInto(&batch, mem)` applies the operations (Puts/Deletes) from the recovered batch to the in-memory `MemTable` (`mem`).
229:     *   The code keeps track of the latest sequence number encountered.
230:     *   Optionally, if the `MemTable` fills up *during* recovery, it can be flushed to an SSTable just like during normal operation.
231: 4.  This continues until `ReadRecord` returns `false` (end of log file) or an error occurs.
232: 
233: The `log::Reader::ReadRecord` implementation handles the details of reading blocks, finding headers, checking checksums, and combining `kFirstType`, `kMiddleType`, `kLastType` fragments.
234: 
235: ```c++
236: // --- Simplified from db/log_reader.cc ---
237: 
238: // Reads the next complete logical record. Returns true if successful.
239: bool Reader::ReadRecord(Slice* record, std::string* scratch) {
240:   // ... skip records before initial_offset if necessary ...
241: 
242:   scratch->clear();
243:   record->clear();
244:   bool in_fragmented_record = false;
245: 
246:   Slice fragment; // To hold data from one physical record
247:   while (true) {
248:     // Reads the next physical record (header + data fragment) from the file blocks.
249:     // Handles reading across block boundaries internally.
250:     const unsigned int record_type = ReadPhysicalRecord(&fragment);
251: 
252:     // ... handle resyncing logic after seeking ...
253: 
254:     switch (record_type) {
255:       case kFullType:
256:         // ... sanity check for unexpected fragments ...
257:         *record = fragment; // Got a complete record in one piece
258:         return true;
259: 
260:       case kFirstType:
261:         // ... sanity check for unexpected fragments ...
262:         scratch->assign(fragment.data(), fragment.size()); // Start of a new fragmented record
263:         in_fragmented_record = true;
264:         break;
265: 
266:       case kMiddleType:
267:         if (!in_fragmented_record) { /* Report corruption */ }
268:         else { scratch->append(fragment.data(), fragment.size()); } // Append middle piece
269:         break;
270: 
271:       case kLastType:
272:         if (!in_fragmented_record) { /* Report corruption */ }
273:         else {
274:           scratch->append(fragment.data(), fragment.size()); // Append final piece
275:           *record = Slice(*scratch); // Reassembled record is complete
276:           return true;
277:         }
278:         break;
279: 
280:       case kEof:
281:         return false; // End of log file
282: 
283:       case kBadRecord:
284:         // ... report corruption, clear state ...
285:         in_fragmented_record = false;
286:         scratch->clear();
287:         break; // Try to find the next valid record
288: 
289:       default:
290:         // ... report corruption ...
291:         in_fragmented_record = false;
292:         scratch->clear();
293:         break; // Try to find the next valid record
294:     }
295:   }
296: }
297: ```
298: 
299: **Explanation:**
300: 
301: *   `ReadRecord` calls `ReadPhysicalRecord` repeatedly in a loop.
302: *   `ReadPhysicalRecord` (internal helper, not shown in full) reads from the file, parses the 7-byte header, checks the CRC, and returns the type and the data fragment (`result`). It handles skipping block trailers and reading new blocks as needed.
303: *   Based on the `record_type`, `ReadRecord` either returns the complete record (`kFullType`), starts assembling fragments (`kFirstType`), appends fragments (`kMiddleType`), or finishes assembling and returns the record (`kLastType`).
304: *   It manages the `scratch` buffer to hold the fragments being assembled.

342: 
343: ## Conclusion
344: 
345: The **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** is a critical component for ensuring **durability** in LevelDB. By writing every operation to an append-only log file on disk *before* applying it to the in-memory `MemTable` and acknowledging the write, LevelDB guarantees that no acknowledged data is lost even if the server crashes.
346: 
347: *   The `log::Writer` handles appending records to the current WAL file, dealing with block formatting and fragmentation.
348: *   The `log::Reader` handles reading records back from the WAL file during recovery, verifying checksums and reassembling fragmented records.
349: *   This recovery process replays the logged operations to rebuild the `MemTable` state that was lost in the crash.
350: 
351: The WAL, MemTable, and SSTables work together: WAL provides fast durability for recent writes, MemTable provides fast access to those recent writes in memory, and SSTables provide persistent, sorted storage for the bulk of the data.
352: 
353: Now that we understand the core storage structures (SSTables, MemTable, WAL), we can start looking at how they are managed and coordinated.

  8: # Chapter 4: DBImpl - The Database General Manager
  9: 
 10: In the previous chapters, we've explored some key ingredients of LevelDB:
 11: *   [SSTables](01_table___sstable___tablecache.md) for storing data permanently on disk.
 12: *   The [MemTable](02_memtable.md) for quickly handling recent writes in memory.
 13: *   The [Write-Ahead Log (WAL)](03_write_ahead_log__wal____logwriter_logreader.md) for ensuring durability even if the system crashes.
 14: 
 15: But how do all these pieces work together? Who tells LevelDB to write to the WAL first, *then* the MemTable? Who decides when the MemTable is full and needs to be flushed to an SSTable? Who coordinates reading data from both memory *and* disk files?
 16: 
 17: ## What's the Problem? Orchestrating Everything
 18: 
 19: Imagine a large library. You have librarians putting books on shelves (SSTables), a front desk clerk taking newly returned books (MemTable), and a security guard logging everyone who enters (WAL). But someone needs to be in charge of the whole operation – the **General Manager**.
 20: 
 21: This manager doesn't shelve every book themselves, but they direct the staff, manage the budget, decide when to rearrange sections (compaction), and handle emergencies (recovery). Without a manager, it would be chaos!
 22: 
 23: LevelDB needs a similar central coordinator to manage all its different parts and ensure they work together smoothly and correctly.
 24: 
 25: ## DBImpl: The General Manager of LevelDB
 26: 
 27: The `DBImpl` class is the heart of LevelDB's implementation. It's the **General Manager** of our database library. It doesn't *contain* the data itself (that's in MemTables and SSTables), but it **orchestrates** almost every operation.
 28: 
 29: *   It takes requests from your application (like `Put`, `Get`, `Delete`).
 30: *   It directs these requests to the right components (WAL, MemTable, TableCache).
 31: *   It manages the state of the database (like which MemTable is active, which files exist).
 32: *   It initiates and manages background tasks like flushing the MemTable and running compactions.
 33: *   It handles the recovery process when the database starts up.
 34: 
 35: Almost every interaction you have with a LevelDB database object ultimately goes through `DBImpl`.
 36: 
 37: ## Key Responsibilities of DBImpl
 38: 
 39: Think of the `DBImpl` general manager juggling several key tasks:
 40: 
 41: 1.  **Handling Writes (`Put`, `Delete`, `Write`):** Ensuring data is safely written to the WAL and then the MemTable. Managing the process when the MemTable fills up.
 42: 2.  **Handling Reads (`Get`, `NewIterator`):** Figuring out where to find the requested data – checking the active MemTable, the soon-to-be-flushed immutable MemTable, and finally the various SSTable files on disk (using helpers like [Version & VersionSet](06_version___versionset.md) and [Table / SSTable & TableCache](01_table___sstable___tablecache.md)).
 43: 3.  **Background Maintenance ([Compaction](08_compaction.md)):** Deciding when and how to run compactions to clean up old data, merge SSTables, and keep reads efficient. It schedules and oversees this background work.
 44: 4.  **Startup and Recovery:** When the database opens, `DBImpl` manages locking the database directory, reading the manifest file ([Version & VersionSet](06_version___versionset.md)), and replaying the [WAL](03_write_ahead_log__wal____logwriter_logreader.md) to recover any data that wasn't flushed before the last shutdown or crash.
 45: 5.  **Snapshot Management:** Handling requests to create and release snapshots, which provide a consistent view of the database at a specific point in time.
 46: 
 47: `DBImpl` uses other components extensively to perform these tasks. It holds references to the active MemTable (`mem_`), the immutable MemTable (`imm_`), the WAL (`log_`), the `TableCache`, and the `VersionSet` (which tracks all the SSTable files).
 48: 
 49: ## How DBImpl Handles Writes
 50: 
 51: Let's trace a simple `Put` operation:
 52: 
 53: 1.  **Request:** Your application calls `db->Put("mykey", "myvalue")`.
 54: 2.  **DBImpl Entry:** This call enters the `DBImpl::Put` method (which typically wraps the operation in a [WriteBatch](05_writebatch.md) and calls `DBImpl::Write`).
 55: 3.  **Queueing (Optional):** `DBImpl` manages a queue of writers to ensure writes happen in order. It might group multiple concurrent writes together for efficiency (`BuildBatchGroup`).
 56: 4.  **Making Room:** Before writing, `DBImpl` checks if there's space in the current `MemTable` (`mem_`). If not (`MakeRoomForWrite`), it might:
 57:     *   Pause briefly if Level-0 SSTable count is high (slowdown trigger).
 58:     *   Wait if the *immutable* MemTable (`imm_`) is still being flushed.
 59:     *   Wait if Level-0 SSTable count is too high (stop trigger).
 60:     *   **Trigger a MemTable switch:**
 61:         *   Mark the current `mem_` as read-only (`imm_`).
 62:         *   Create a new empty `mem_`.
 63:         *   Create a new WAL file (`logfile_`).
 64:         *   Schedule a background task (`MaybeScheduleCompaction`) to flush the old `imm_` to an SSTable.
 65: 5.  **Write to WAL:** `DBImpl` writes the operation(s) to the current WAL file (`log_->AddRecord(...)`). If requested (`options.sync`), it ensures the WAL data is physically on disk (`logfile_->Sync()`).
 66: 6.  **Write to MemTable:** Only after the WAL write succeeds, `DBImpl` inserts the data into the active `MemTable` (`mem_->Add(...)` via `WriteBatchInternal::InsertInto`).
 67: 7.  **Return:** Control returns to your application.
 68: 
 69: Here's a highly simplified view of the `Write` method:
 70: 
 71: ```c++
 72: // --- Simplified from db/db_impl.cc ---
 73: 
 74: Status DBImpl::Write(const WriteOptions& options, WriteBatch* updates) {
 75:   // ... acquire mutex, manage writer queue (omitted) ...
 76: 
 77:   // Step 4: Make sure there's space. This might trigger a MemTable switch
 78:   // and schedule background work. May wait if MemTable is full or
 79:   // too many L0 files exist.
 80:   Status status = MakeRoomForWrite(updates == nullptr /* force compact? */);
 81: 
 82:   if (status.ok() && updates != nullptr) {
 83:     // ... potentially group multiple concurrent writes (BuildBatchGroup) ...
 84: 
 85:     // Step 5: Add the batch to the Write-Ahead Log
 86:     status = log_->AddRecord(WriteBatchInternal::Contents(updates));
 87:     if (status.ok() && options.sync) {
 88:       // Ensure log entry is on disk if requested
 89:       status = logfile_->Sync();
 90:       // ... handle sync error by recording background error ...
 91:     }
 92: 
 93:     // Step 6: Insert the batch into the active MemTable (only if WAL ok)
 94:     if (status.ok()) {
 95:       status = WriteBatchInternal::InsertInto(updates, mem_);
 96:     }
 97:   }
 98: 
 99:   // ... update sequence number, manage writer queue, release mutex ...
100:   return status; // Step 7: Return status to caller
101: }
102: ```
103: 
104: **Explanation:** This code shows the core sequence: check/make room (`MakeRoomForWrite`), write to the log (`log_->AddRecord`), potentially sync the log (`logfile_->Sync`), and finally insert into the MemTable (`InsertInto(..., mem_)`). Error handling and writer coordination are omitted for clarity.

134:     end
135: ```
136: 
137: ## How DBImpl Handles Reads
138: 
139: Reading data involves checking different places in a specific order to ensure the most recent value is found:
140: 
141: 1.  **Request:** Your application calls `db->Get("mykey")`.
142: 2.  **DBImpl Entry:** The call enters `DBImpl::Get`.
143: 3.  **Snapshot:** `DBImpl` determines the sequence number to read up to (either from the provided `ReadOptions::snapshot` or the current latest sequence number).
144: 4.  **Check MemTable:** It first checks the active `MemTable` (`mem_`). If the key is found (either a value or a deletion marker), the search stops, and the result is returned.
145: 5.  **Check Immutable MemTable:** If not found in `mem_`, and if an immutable MemTable (`imm_`) exists (one that's waiting to be flushed), it checks `imm_`. If found, the search stops.
146: 6.  **Check SSTables:** If the key wasn't found in memory, `DBImpl` asks the current `Version` (managed by `VersionSet`) to find the key in the SSTable files (`current->Get(...)`). The `Version` object knows which files might contain the key and uses the `TableCache` to access them efficiently.
147: 7.  **Update Stats (Optional):** If the read involved checking SSTables, `DBImpl` might update internal statistics about file access (`current->UpdateStats`). If a file is read frequently, this might trigger a future compaction (`MaybeScheduleCompaction`).
148: 8.  **Return:** The value found (or a "Not Found" status) is returned to the application.
149: 
150: A simplified view of `Get`:
151: 
152: ```c++
153: // --- Simplified from db/db_impl.cc ---
154: 
155: Status DBImpl::Get(const ReadOptions& options, const Slice& key,
156:                    std::string* value) {
157:   Status s;
158:   SequenceNumber snapshot;
159:   // ... (Step 3) Determine snapshot sequence number ...
160:   mutex_.Lock(); // Need lock to access mem_, imm_, current version
161:   MemTable* mem = mem_;
162:   MemTable* imm = imm_;
163:   Version* current = versions_->current();
164:   mem->Ref(); // Increase reference counts
165:   if (imm != nullptr) imm->Ref();
166:   current->Ref();
167:   mutex_.Unlock(); // Unlock for potentially slow lookups
168: 
169:   LookupKey lkey(key, snapshot); // Internal key format for lookup
170: 
171:   // Step 4: Check active MemTable
172:   if (mem->Get(lkey, value, &s)) {
173:     // Found in mem_ (value or deletion marker)
174:   }
175:   // Step 5: Check immutable MemTable (if it exists)
176:   else if (imm != nullptr && imm->Get(lkey, value, &s)) {
177:     // Found in imm_
178:   }
179:   // Step 6: Check SSTables via current Version
180:   else {
181:     Version::GetStats stats; // To record file access stats
182:     s = current->Get(options, lkey, value, &stats);
183:     // Step 7: Maybe update stats and schedule compaction
184:     if (current->UpdateStats(stats)) {
185:        mutex_.Lock();
186:        MaybeScheduleCompaction(); // Needs lock
187:        mutex_.Unlock();
188:     }
189:   }
190: 
191:   // Decrease reference counts
192:   mutex_.Lock();
193:   mem->Unref();
194:   if (imm != nullptr) imm->Unref();
195:   current->Unref();
196:   mutex_.Unlock();
197: 
198:   return s; // Step 8: Return status
199: }
200: ```
201: 
202: **Explanation:** This shows the order of checking: `mem->Get`, `imm->Get`, and finally `current->Get` (which searches SSTables). It also highlights the reference counting (`Ref`/`Unref`) needed because these components might be changed or deleted by background threads while the read is in progress. The lock is held only when accessing shared pointers, not during the actual data lookup.

234: 
235: ## Managing Background Work (Compaction)
236: 
237: `DBImpl` is responsible for kicking off background work. It doesn't *do* the compaction itself (that logic is largely within [Compaction](08_compaction.md) and [VersionSet](06_version___versionset.md)), but it manages the *triggering* and the background thread.
238: 
239: *   **When is work needed?** `DBImpl` checks if work is needed in a few places:
240:     *   After a MemTable switch (`MakeRoomForWrite` schedules flush of `imm_`).
241:     *   After a read operation updates file stats (`Get` might call `MaybeScheduleCompaction`).
242:     *   After a background compaction finishes (it checks if *more* compaction is needed).
243:     *   When explicitly requested (`CompactRange`).
244: *   **Scheduling:** If work is needed and a background task isn't already running, `DBImpl::MaybeScheduleCompaction` sets a flag (`background_compaction_scheduled_`) and asks the `Env` (Environment object, handles OS interactions) to schedule a function (`DBImpl::BGWork`) to run on a background thread.
245: *   **Performing Work:** The background thread eventually calls `DBImpl::BackgroundCall`, which locks the mutex and calls `DBImpl::BackgroundCompaction`. This method decides *what* work to do:
246:     *   If `imm_` exists, it calls `CompactMemTable` (which uses `WriteLevel0Table` -> `BuildTable`) to flush it.
247:     *   Otherwise, it asks the `VersionSet` to pick an appropriate SSTable compaction (`versions_->PickCompaction()`).
248:     *   It then calls `DoCompactionWork` to perform the actual SSTable compaction (releasing the main lock during the heavy lifting).
249: *   **Signaling:** Once background work finishes, it signals (`background_work_finished_signal_.SignalAll()`) any foreground threads that might be waiting (e.g., a write operation waiting for `imm_` to be flushed).
250: 
251: Here's the simplified scheduling logic:
252: 
253: ```c++
254: // --- Simplified from db/db_impl.cc ---
255: 
256: void DBImpl::MaybeScheduleCompaction() {
257:   mutex_.AssertHeld(); // Must hold lock to check/change state
258: 
259:   if (background_compaction_scheduled_) {
260:     // Already scheduled
261:   } else if (shutting_down_.load(std::memory_order_acquire)) {
262:     // DB is closing
263:   } else if (!bg_error_.ok()) {
264:     // Background error stopped activity
265:   } else if (imm_ == nullptr && // No MemTable flush needed AND
266:              manual_compaction_ == nullptr && // No manual request AND
267:              !versions_->NeedsCompaction()) { // VersionSet says no work needed
268:     // No work to be done
269:   } else {
270:     // Work needs to be done! Schedule it.
271:     background_compaction_scheduled_ = true;
272:     env_->Schedule(&DBImpl::BGWork, this); // Ask Env to run BGWork later
273:   }
274: }
275: ```
276: 
277: **Explanation:** This function checks several conditions under a lock. If there's an immutable MemTable to flush (`imm_ != nullptr`) or the `VersionSet` indicates compaction is needed (`versions_->NeedsCompaction()`) and no background task is already scheduled, it marks one as scheduled and tells the environment (`env_`) to run the `BGWork` function in the background.

297: ## Recovery on Startup
298: 
299: When you open a database, `DBImpl::Open` orchestrates the recovery process:
300: 
301: 1.  **Lock:** It locks the database directory (`env_->LockFile`) to prevent other processes from using it.
302: 2.  **Recover VersionSet:** It calls `versions_->Recover()`, which reads the `MANIFEST` file to understand the state of SSTables from the last clean run.
303: 3.  **Find Logs:** It scans the database directory for any `.log` files (WAL files) that are newer than the ones recorded in the `MANIFEST`. These logs represent writes that might not have been flushed to SSTables before the last shutdown/crash.
304: 4.  **Replay Logs:** For each relevant log file found, it calls `DBImpl::RecoverLogFile`.
305:     *   Inside `RecoverLogFile`, it creates a `log::Reader`.
306:     *   It reads records (which are serialized `WriteBatch`es) from the log file one by one.
307:     *   For each record, it applies the operations (`WriteBatchInternal::InsertInto`) to a temporary in-memory `MemTable`.
308:     *   This effectively rebuilds the state of the MemTable(s) as they were just before the crash/shutdown.
309: 5.  **Finalize State:** Once all logs are replayed, the recovered MemTable becomes the active `mem_`. If the recovery process itself filled the MemTable, `RecoverLogFile` might even flush it to a Level-0 SSTable (`WriteLevel0Table`). `DBImpl` updates the `VersionSet` with the recovered sequence number and potentially writes a new `MANIFEST`.
310: 6.  **Ready:** The database is now recovered and ready for new operations.
311: 
312: Here's a conceptual snippet from the recovery logic:
313: 
314: ```c++
315: // --- Conceptual, simplified from DBImpl::RecoverLogFile ---
316: 
317: // Inside loop processing a single log file during recovery:
318: while (reader.ReadRecord(&record, &scratch) && status.ok()) {
319:   // Check if record looks like a valid WriteBatch
320:   if (record.size() < 12) { /* report corruption */ continue; }
321: 
322:   // Parse the raw log record back into a WriteBatch object
323:   WriteBatchInternal::SetContents(&batch, record);
324: 
325:   // Create a MemTable if we don't have one yet for this log
326:   if (mem == nullptr) {
327:     mem = new MemTable(internal_comparator_);
328:     mem->Ref();
329:   }
330: 
331:   // Apply the operations from the batch TO THE MEMTABLE
332:   status = WriteBatchInternal::InsertInto(&batch, mem);
333:   // ... handle error ...
334: 
335:   // Keep track of the latest sequence number seen
336:   const SequenceNumber last_seq = /* ... get sequence from batch ... */;
337:   if (last_seq > *max_sequence) {
338:     *max_sequence = last_seq;
339:   }
340: 
341:   // If the MemTable gets full *during recovery*, flush it!
342:   if (mem->ApproximateMemoryUsage() > options_.write_buffer_size) {
343:     status = WriteLevel0Table(mem, edit, nullptr); // Flush to L0 SSTable
344:     mem->Unref();
345:     mem = nullptr; // Will create a new one if needed
346:     // ... handle error ...
347:   }
348: }
349: // After loop, handle the final state of 'mem'
350: ```
351: 
352: **Explanation:** This loop reads each record (a `WriteBatch`) from the log file using `reader.ReadRecord`. It then applies the batch's changes directly to an in-memory `MemTable` (`InsertInto(&batch, mem)`), effectively replaying the lost writes. It even handles flushing this MemTable if it fills up during the recovery process.
353: 
354: ## The DBImpl Class (Code Glimpse)
355: 
356: The definition of `DBImpl` in `db_impl.h` shows the key components it manages:
357: 
358: ```c++

429:   // Compaction statistics
430:   CompactionStats stats_[config::kNumLevels] GUARDED_BY(mutex_);
431: };
432: ```
433: 
434: **Explanation:** This header shows `DBImpl` inheriting from the public `DB` interface. It contains references to essential components like the `Env`, `Options`, `TableCache`, `MemTable` (`mem_` and `imm_`), WAL (`log_`, `logfile_`), and `VersionSet`. Crucially, it also has a `mutex_` to protect shared state accessed by multiple threads (foreground application threads and background compaction threads) and condition variables (`background_work_finished_signal_`) to allow threads to wait for background work.
435: 
436: ## Conclusion
437: 
438: `DBImpl` is the central nervous system of LevelDB. It doesn't store the data itself, but it acts as the **General Manager**, receiving requests and coordinating the actions of all the other specialized components like the MemTable, WAL, VersionSet, and TableCache. It handles the intricate dance between fast in-memory writes, durable logging, persistent disk storage, background maintenance, and safe recovery. Understanding `DBImpl`'s role is key to seeing how all the pieces of LevelDB fit together to create a functional database.
439: 
440: One tool `DBImpl` uses to make writes efficient and atomic is the `WriteBatch`. Let's see how that works next.

  8: # Chapter 5: WriteBatch - Grouping Changes Together
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 4: DBImpl](04_dbimpl.md), we saw how `DBImpl` acts as the general manager, coordinating writes, reads, and background tasks. We learned that when you call `Put` or `Delete`, `DBImpl` handles writing to the [Write-Ahead Log (WAL)](03_write_ahead_log__wal____logwriter_logreader.md) and then updating the [MemTable](02_memtable.md).
 11: 
 12: But what if you need to make *multiple* changes that should happen *together*?
 13: 
 14: ## What's the Problem? Making Multiple Changes Atomically
 15: 
 16: Imagine you're managing game scores. When Player A beats Player B, you need to do two things: increase Player A's score and decrease Player B's score.
 17: 
 18: ```
 19: // Goal: Increase playerA score, decrease playerB score
 20: db->Put(options, "score_playerA", "101");
 21: db->Put(options, "score_playerB", "49");
 22: ```
 23: 
 24: What happens if the system crashes right *after* the first `Put` but *before* the second `Put`? Player A gets a point, but Player B *doesn't* lose one. The scores are now inconsistent! This isn't good.
 25: 
 26: We need a way to tell LevelDB: "Please perform these *multiple* operations (like updating both scores) as a single, indivisible unit. Either *all* of them should succeed, or *none* of them should." This property is called **atomicity**.
 27: 
 28: ## WriteBatch: The Atomic To-Do List
 29: 
 30: LevelDB provides the `WriteBatch` class to solve this exact problem.
 31: 
 32: Think of a `WriteBatch` like making a **shopping list** before you go to the store, or giving a librarian a list of multiple transactions to perform all at once (check out book A, return book B).
 33: 
 34: 1.  **Collect Changes:** You create an empty `WriteBatch` object. Then, instead of calling `db->Put` or `db->Delete` directly, you call `batch.Put` and `batch.Delete` to add your desired changes to the batch object. This just adds items to your "to-do list" in memory; it doesn't modify the database yet.
 35: 2.  **Apply Atomically:** Once your list is complete, you hand the entire `WriteBatch` to the database using a single `db->Write(options, &batch)` call.
 36: 3.  **All or Nothing:** LevelDB guarantees that all the operations (`Put`s and `Delete`s) listed in the `WriteBatch` will be applied **atomically**. They will either *all* succeed and become durable together, or if something goes wrong (like a crash during the process), *none* of them will appear to have happened after recovery.
 37: 
 38: Using `WriteBatch` for our score update:
 39: 
 40: ```c++
 41: #include "leveldb/write_batch.h"
 42: #include "leveldb/db.h"
 43: 
 44: // ... assume db is an open LevelDB database ...
 45: leveldb::WriteOptions write_options;
 46: write_options.sync = true; // Ensure durability
 47: 
 48: // 1. Create an empty WriteBatch
 49: leveldb::WriteBatch batch;
 50: 
 51: // 2. Add changes to the batch (in memory)
 52: batch.Put("score_playerA", "101"); // Add 'Put playerA' to the list
 53: batch.Delete("old_temp_key");       // Add 'Delete old_temp_key' to the list
 54: batch.Put("score_playerB", "49");  // Add 'Put playerB' to the list
 55: 
 56: // 3. Apply the entire batch atomically
 57: leveldb::Status status = db->Write(write_options, &batch);
 58: 
 59: if (status.ok()) {
 60:   // Success! Both score_playerA and score_playerB are updated,
 61:   // and old_temp_key is deleted.
 62: } else {
 63:   // Failure! The database state is unchanged. Neither score was updated,
 64:   // and old_temp_key was not deleted.
 65: }
 66: ```
 67: 
 68: **Explanation:**
 69: 
 70: 1.  We create a `WriteBatch` called `batch`.
 71: 2.  We call `batch.Put` and `batch.Delete`. These methods modify the `batch` object itself, not the database. They are very fast as they just record the desired operations internally.
 72: 3.  We call `db->Write` with the completed `batch`. LevelDB now takes this list and applies it atomically. Thanks to the [WAL](03_write_ahead_log__wal____logwriter_logreader.md), even if the system crashes *during* the `db->Write` call, recovery will ensure either all changes from the batch are applied or none are.
 73: 
 74: ## Performance Benefit Too!
 75: 
 76: Besides atomicity, `WriteBatch` also often improves performance when making multiple changes:
 77: 
 78: *   **Single Log Write:** LevelDB can write the *entire batch* as a single record to the WAL file on disk. This is usually much faster than writing separate log records for each individual `Put` or `Delete`, reducing disk I/O.
 79: *   **Single Lock Acquisition:** The `DBImpl` only needs to acquire its internal lock once for the entire `Write` call, rather than once per operation.
 80: 
 81: So, even if you don't strictly *need* atomicity, using `WriteBatch` for bulk updates can be faster.
 82: 
 83: ## Under the Hood: How WriteBatch Works
 84: 
 85: What happens inside LevelDB when you call `db->Write(options, &batch)`?
 86: 
 87: 1.  **Serialization:** The `WriteBatch` object holds a simple, serialized representation of all the `Put` and `Delete` operations you added. It's basically a byte string (`rep_` internally) containing the sequence of operations and their arguments.
 88: 2.  **DBImpl Coordination:** The `DBImpl::Write` method receives the `WriteBatch`.
 89: 3.  **WAL Write:** `DBImpl` takes the entire serialized content of the `WriteBatch` (from `WriteBatchInternal::Contents`) and writes it as **one single record** to the [Write-Ahead Log (WAL)](03_write_ahead_log__wal____logwriter_logreader.md) using `log_->AddRecord()`.
 90: 4.  **MemTable Update:** If the WAL write is successful (and synced to disk if `options.sync` is true), `DBImpl` then iterates through the operations *within* the `WriteBatch`. For each operation, it applies the change to the in-memory [MemTable](02_memtable.md) (`WriteBatchInternal::InsertInto(batch, mem_)`).
 91: 
 92: This two-step process (WAL first, then MemTable) ensures both durability and atomicity. If a crash occurs after the WAL write but before the MemTable update finishes, the recovery process will read the *entire batch* from the WAL and re-apply it to the MemTable, ensuring all changes are present.

124: ## WriteBatch Internals (Code View)
125: 
126: Let's peek at the code.
127: 
128: **Adding to the Batch:**
129: 
130: When you call `batch.Put("key", "val")` or `batch.Delete("key")`, the `WriteBatch` simply appends a representation of that operation to its internal string buffer (`rep_`).
131: 
132: ```c++
133: // --- File: leveldb/write_batch.cc ---
134: 
135: // Simplified serialization format:
136: // rep_ :=
137: //    sequence: fixed64 (8 bytes, initially 0)
138: //    count:    fixed32 (4 bytes, number of records)
139: //    data:     record[count]
140: // record :=
141: //    kTypeValue  varstring varstring |
142: //    kTypeDeletion varstring
143: // varstring :=
144: //    len: varint32
145: //    data: uint8[len]
146:

179:   return Slice(batch->rep_);
180: }
181: ```
182: 
183: **Explanation:**
184: 
185: *   Each `Put` or `Delete` increments a counter stored in the first 12 bytes (`kHeader`) of the internal string `rep_`.
186: *   It then appends a 1-byte type marker (`kTypeValue` or `kTypeDeletion`).
187: *   Finally, it appends the key (and value for `Put`) using `PutLengthPrefixedSlice`, which writes the length of the slice followed by its data. This makes it easy to parse the operations back later.
188: 
189: **Applying the Batch to MemTable:**
190: 
191: When `DBImpl::Write` calls `WriteBatchInternal::InsertInto(batch, mem_)`, this helper function iterates through the serialized `rep_` string and applies each operation to the MemTable.
192: 
193: ```c++
194: // --- File: leveldb/write_batch.cc ---
195: // Helper class used by InsertInto
196: namespace {
197: class MemTableInserter : public WriteBatch::Handler {
198:  public:
199:   SequenceNumber sequence_; // Starting sequence number for the batch
200:   MemTable* mem_;           // MemTable to insert into
201: 
202:   void Put(const Slice& key, const Slice& value) override {
203:     // Add the Put operation to the MemTable
204:     mem_->Add(sequence_, kTypeValue, key, value);
205:     sequence_++; // Increment sequence number for the next operation
206:   }
207:   void Delete(const Slice& key) override {
208:     // Add the Delete operation (as a deletion marker) to the MemTable
209:     mem_->Add(sequence_, kTypeDeletion, key, Slice()); // Value is ignored
210:     sequence_++; // Increment sequence number for the next operation
211:   }
212: };
213: } // namespace
214: 
215: // Applies the batch operations to the MemTable
216: Status WriteBatchInternal::InsertInto(const WriteBatch* b, MemTable* memtable) {
217:   MemTableInserter inserter;
218:   // Get the starting sequence number assigned by DBImpl::Write
219:   inserter.sequence_ = WriteBatchInternal::Sequence(b);
220:   inserter.mem_ = memtable;
221:   // Iterate() parses rep_ and calls handler.Put/handler.Delete
222:   return b->Iterate(&inserter);
223: }
224: 
225: // Helper to get/set the 8-byte sequence number from header (bytes 0-7)
226: SequenceNumber WriteBatchInternal::Sequence(const WriteBatch* b) {
227:   return SequenceNumber(DecodeFixed64(b->rep_.data()));
228: }
229: void WriteBatchInternal::SetSequence(WriteBatch* b, SequenceNumber seq) {
230:   EncodeFixed64(&b->rep_[0], seq);
231: }
232: ```
233: 
234: **Explanation:**
235: 
236: 1.  `InsertInto` creates a helper object `MemTableInserter`.
237: 2.  It gets the starting `SequenceNumber` for this batch (which was assigned by `DBImpl::Write` and stored in the batch's header).
238: 3.  It calls `b->Iterate(&inserter)`. The `Iterate` method (code not shown, but it reverses the serialization process) parses the `rep_` string. For each operation it finds, it calls the appropriate method on the `inserter` object (`Put` or `Delete`).
239: 4.  The `inserter.Put` and `inserter.Delete` methods simply call `mem_->Add`, passing along the correct sequence number (which increments for each operation within the batch) and the type (`kTypeValue` or `kTypeDeletion`).
240: 
241: ## Conclusion
242: 
243: The `WriteBatch` is a simple yet powerful tool in LevelDB. It allows you to:
244: 
245: 1.  **Group Multiple Changes:** Collect several `Put` and `Delete` operations together.
246: 2.  **Ensure Atomicity:** Apply these changes as a single, all-or-nothing unit using `db->Write`. This prevents inconsistent states if errors or crashes occur mid-operation.
247: 3.  **Improve Performance:** Often makes bulk updates faster by reducing the number of WAL writes and lock acquisitions.
248: 
249: It works by serializing the list of operations into a byte string, which LevelDB writes to the WAL as a single record and then replays into the MemTable.
250: 
251: Now that we understand how individual changes and batches of changes are safely written and stored temporarily in the MemTable and WAL, how does LevelDB manage the overall state of the database, including all the SSTable files on disk? How does it know which files contain the data for a particular key?

  8: # Chapter 6: Version & VersionSet - The Database Catalog
  9: 
 10: In the previous chapter, [Chapter 5: WriteBatch](05_writebatch.md), we learned how LevelDB groups multiple `Put` and `Delete` operations together to apply them atomically and efficiently. We saw that writes go first to the [Write-Ahead Log (WAL)](03_write_ahead_log__wal____logwriter_logreader.md) for durability, and then to the in-memory [MemTable](02_memtable.md).
 11: 
 12: Eventually, the MemTable gets full and is flushed to an [SSTable](01_table___sstable___tablecache.md) file on disk. Over time, LevelDB also runs compactions, which read data from existing SSTables and write new ones, deleting the old ones afterwards. This means the set of SSTable files that represent the database's current state is constantly changing!
 13: 
 14: ## What's the Problem? Tracking a Changing Set of Files
 15: 
 16: Imagine our library again. Books (SSTables) are constantly being added (from MemTable flushes), removed (after compaction), and sometimes even moved between sections (levels during compaction). How does the librarian know *which* books are currently part of the official collection and where they are located? If a reader asks for information, the librarian can't just guess which books to look in – they need an accurate, up-to-date catalog.
 17: 
 18: Similarly, LevelDB needs a system to track:
 19: 
 20: 1.  Which SSTable files exist and are currently "live" (contain valid data)?
 21: 2.  Which "level" each live SSTable file belongs to? (Levels are important for compaction, see [Chapter 8: Compaction](08_compaction.md)).
 22: 3.  What's the overall state of the database, like the next available file number or the sequence number of the last operation?
 23: 4.  How can reads see a consistent snapshot of the database, even while background tasks are adding and removing files?
 24: 
 25: ## The Solution: Versions, VersionEdits, and the VersionSet
 26: 
 27: LevelDB uses a trio of concepts to manage this state:
 28: 
 29: 1.  **Version:** Think of a `Version` object as **one specific edition of the library's catalog**. It represents a complete, consistent snapshot of the database state at a single point in time. Specifically, it contains lists of all the live SSTable files for *each* level. Once created, a `Version` object is **immutable** – it never changes, just like a printed catalog edition. Reads (`Get` operations or [Iterators](07_iterator.md)) use a specific `Version` to know which files to consult.
 30: 
 31: 2.  **VersionEdit:** This is like a **list of corrections and updates** to get from one catalog edition to the next. It describes the *changes* between two versions. A `VersionEdit` might say:
 32:     *   "Add file number 15 to Level-0." (Because a MemTable was flushed).
 33:     *   "Remove files 8 and 9 from Level-1." (Because they were compacted).
 34:     *   "Add file number 25 to Level-2." (The result of the compaction).
 35:     *   "Update the next available file number to 26."
 36:     *   "Update the last sequence number."
 37:     These edits are small descriptions of changes. They are stored persistently in a special file called the `MANIFEST`.
 38: 
 39: 3.  **VersionSet:** This is the **chief librarian** or the **cataloguing department**. It's the central manager for all database state related to the set of live files. The `VersionSet` performs several critical tasks:
 40:     *   Keeps track of the single `current` Version (the latest catalog edition).
 41:     *   Reads the `MANIFEST` file during startup to reconstruct the database state.
 42:     *   Applies `VersionEdit`s to the `current` Version to create *new* `Version`s.
 43:     *   Manages essential metadata like the `next_file_number_`, `log_number_`, and `last_sequence_`.
 44:     *   Decides which compactions are needed ([Chapter 8: Compaction](08_compaction.md)).
 45:     *   Manages the lifecycle of `Version` objects (using reference counting) so that old versions needed by iterators or snapshots aren't deleted prematurely.
 46: 
 47: **In short:** `VersionSet` uses `VersionEdit`s (from the `MANIFEST`) to create a sequence of immutable `Version`s, each representing the database state at a point in time. The `current` `Version` tells LevelDB which files to read from.
 48: 
 49: ## How Reads Use Versions
 50: 
 51: When you perform a `Get(key)` operation, the [DBImpl](04_dbimpl.md) needs to know which SSTables to check (after checking the MemTables). It does this by consulting the `current` `Version` held by the `VersionSet`.
 52: 
 53: ```c++
 54: // --- Simplified from db/db_impl.cc Get() ---
 55: 
 56: Status DBImpl::Get(const ReadOptions& options, const Slice& key,
 57:                    std::string* value) {
 58:   // ... check MemTable, Immutable MemTable first ...
 59: 
 60:   // If not found in memory, check SSTables:
 61:   else {
 62:     MutexLock l(&mutex_); // Need lock to get current Version pointer safely
 63:     Version* current = versions_->current(); // Ask VersionSet for current Version
 64:     current->Ref();       // Increment ref count (important!)
 65:     mutex_.Unlock();      // Unlock for potentially slow disk I/O
 66: 
 67:     LookupKey lkey(key, snapshot_sequence_number); // Key to search for
 68:     Version::GetStats stats;
 69:     // Ask the Version object to perform the lookup in its files
 70:     Status s = current->Get(options, lkey, value, &stats);
 71: 
 72:     mutex_.Lock();        // Re-acquire lock for cleanup
 73:     current->Unref();     // Decrement ref count
 74:     // ... maybe trigger compaction based on stats ...
 75:     mutex_.Unlock();
 76:     return s;
 77:   }
 78:   // ...
 79: }
 80: ```
 81: 
 82: The key step is `versions_->current()->Get(...)`. The `DBImpl` asks the `VersionSet` (`versions_`) for the pointer to the `current` `Version`. It then calls the `Get` method *on that `Version` object*.
 83: 
 84: How does `Version::Get` work?
 85: 
 86: ```c++
 87: // --- Simplified from db/version_set.cc ---
 88: 
 89: Status Version::Get(const ReadOptions& options, const LookupKey& k,
 90:                     std::string* value, GetStats* stats) {
 91:   Slice ikey = k.internal_key();
 92:   Slice user_key = k.user_key();
 93: 
 94:   // We search level-by-level
 95:   for (int level = 0; level < config::kNumLevels; level++) {
 96:     const std::vector<FileMetaData*>& files = files_[level]; // Get list for this level
 97:     if (files.empty()) continue; // Skip empty levels
 98: 
 99:     if (level == 0) {
100:       // Level-0 files might overlap, search newest-first
101:       std::vector<FileMetaData*> tmp;
102:       // Find potentially overlapping files in level 0
103:       // ... logic to find relevant files ...
104:       // Sort them newest-first
105:       std::sort(tmp.begin(), tmp.end(), NewestFirst);
106:       // Search each relevant file
107:       for (uint32_t i = 0; i < tmp.size(); i++) {
108:         FileMetaData* f = tmp[i];
109:         // Use TableCache to search the actual SSTable file
110:         Status s = vset_->table_cache_->Get(options, f->number, f->file_size,
111:                                            ikey, /* saver state */, SaveValue);
112:         // ... check if found/deleted/error and update stats ...
113:         if (/* found or deleted */) return s;
114:       }
115:     } else {
116:       // Levels > 0 files are sorted and non-overlapping
117:       // Binary search to find the single file that might contain the key
118:       uint32_t index = FindFile(vset_->icmp_, files, ikey);
119:       if (index < files.size()) {
120:         FileMetaData* f = files[index];
121:         // Check if user_key is within the file's range
122:         if (/* user_key is within f->smallest/f->largest range */) {
123:           // Use TableCache to search the actual SSTable file
124:           Status s = vset_->table_cache_->Get(options, f->number, f->file_size,
125:                                              ikey, /* saver state */, SaveValue);
126:           // ... check if found/deleted/error and update stats ...
127:           if (/* found or deleted */) return s;
128:         }
129:       }
130:     }
131:   } // End loop over levels
132: 
133:   return Status::NotFound(Slice()); // Key not found in any SSTable
134: }
135: ```
136: 
137: **Explanation:**
138: 
139: 1.  The `Version` object has arrays (`files_[level]`) storing `FileMetaData` pointers for each level. `FileMetaData` contains the file number, size, and smallest/largest keys for an SSTable.
140: 2.  It iterates through the levels.
141: 3.  **Level 0:** Files might overlap, so it finds all potentially relevant files, sorts them newest-first (by file number), and checks each one using the [Table / SSTable & TableCache](01_table___sstable___tablecache.md).
142: 4.  **Levels > 0:** Files are sorted and non-overlapping. It performs a binary search (`FindFile`) to quickly locate the *single* file that *might* contain the key. It checks that file's key range and then searches it using the `TableCache`.
143: 5.  The search stops as soon as the key is found (either a value or a deletion marker) in any file. If it searches all relevant files in all levels without finding the key, it returns `NotFound`.
144: 
145: The `Version` object acts as the map, guiding the search to the correct SSTable files.
146: 
147: ## How State Changes: Applying VersionEdits
148: 
149: The database state doesn't stand still. MemTables are flushed, compactions happen. How does the `VersionSet` update the state? By applying `VersionEdit`s.
150: 
151: When a background task (like flushing the immutable MemTable or running a compaction) finishes, it creates a `VersionEdit` describing the changes it made (e.g., "add file X, remove file Y"). It then asks the `VersionSet` to apply this edit.
152: 
153: The core logic is in `VersionSet::LogAndApply`:
154: 
155: ```c++
156: // --- Simplified from db/version_set.cc ---
157: 
158: Status VersionSet::LogAndApply(VersionEdit* edit, port::Mutex* mu) {
159:   // 1. Fill in metadata in the edit (log number, sequence number etc.)
160:   // ... set edit->log_number_, edit->last_sequence_, etc. ...
161: 
162:   // 2. Create a new Version based on the current one + the edit
163:   Version* v = new Version(this);
164:   {
165:     Builder builder(this, current_); // Builder starts with 'current_' state
166:     builder.Apply(edit);             // Apply the changes described by 'edit'
167:     builder.SaveTo(v);               // Save the resulting state into 'v'
168:   }
169:   Finalize(v); // Calculate compaction score/level for the new version
170: 
171:   // 3. Write the edit to the MANIFEST file (for persistence)
172:   std::string record;
173:   edit->EncodeTo(&record); // Serialize the VersionEdit
174: 
175:   // Unlock mutex while writing to disk (can be slow)
176:   mu->Unlock();
177:   Status s = descriptor_log_->AddRecord(record); // Append edit to MANIFEST log
178:   if (s.ok()) {
179:     s = descriptor_file_->Sync(); // Ensure MANIFEST write is durable
180:   }
181:   // ... handle MANIFEST write errors ...
182:   mu->Lock(); // Re-lock mutex
183: 
184:   // 4. Install the new version as the 'current' one
185:   if (s.ok()) {
186:     AppendVersion(v); // Make 'v' the new current_ version
187:     // Update VersionSet's metadata based on the edit
188:     log_number_ = edit->log_number_;
189:     prev_log_number_ = edit->prev_log_number_;
190:   } else {
191:     delete v; // Discard the new version if MANIFEST write failed
192:   }
193: 
194:   return s;
195: }
196: ```
197: 
198: **Explanation:**
199: 
200: 1.  **Prepare Edit:** Fills in missing metadata fields in the `VersionEdit` (like the current log number and last sequence number).
201: 2.  **Build New Version:** Creates a temporary `Builder` object, initialized with the state of the `current_` version. It applies the changes from the `edit` to this builder and then saves the resulting state into a completely *new* `Version` object (`v`).
202: 3.  **Log to MANIFEST:** Serializes the `VersionEdit` into a string (`record`) and appends it to the `MANIFEST` log file (`descriptor_log_`). This step makes the state change persistent. If the database crashes and restarts, it can replay the `MANIFEST` file to recover the state.
203: 4.  **Install New Version:** If the `MANIFEST` write succeeds, it calls `AppendVersion(v)`. This crucial step updates the `current_` pointer in the `VersionSet` to point to the newly created `Version` `v`. Future read operations will now use this new version. It also updates the `VersionSet`'s own metadata (like `log_number_`).
204: 
205: This process ensures that the database state transitions atomically: a new `Version` only becomes `current` *after* the changes it represents have been safely recorded in the `MANIFEST`.

231: 
232: ## Version Lifecycle and Snapshots
233: 
234: Why keep old `Version` objects around if we have a `current` one? Because ongoing read operations or snapshots might still need them!
235: 
236: *   **Reference Counting:** Each `Version` has a reference count (`refs_`). When `DBImpl::Get` uses a version, it calls `Ref()` (increment count) before starting the lookup and `Unref()` (decrement count) when finished.
237: *   **Snapshots:** When you request a snapshot (`db->GetSnapshot()`), LevelDB essentially gives you a pointer to the `current` `Version` at that moment and increments its reference count. As long as you hold onto that snapshot, the corresponding `Version` object (and the SSTable files it refers to) won't be deleted, even if the `current` version advances due to subsequent writes and compactions. This provides a consistent point-in-time view of the data.
238: *   **Cleanup:** When a `Version`'s reference count drops to zero (meaning no reads or snapshots are using it anymore), it can be safely deleted. The `VersionSet` also keeps track of which underlying SSTable files are no longer referenced by *any* active `Version` and can trigger their deletion from disk ([DBImpl::RemoveObsoleteFiles](04_dbimpl.md)).
239: 
240: ## The MANIFEST File
241: 
242: The `MANIFEST` file is crucial for durability. It's a log file (like the [WAL](03_write_ahead_log__wal____logwriter_logreader.md), but for metadata changes) that stores the sequence of `VersionEdit` records.
243: 
244: When LevelDB starts (`DB::Open`), the `VersionSet::Recover` method reads the `MANIFEST` file from beginning to end. It starts with an empty initial state and applies each `VersionEdit` it reads, step-by-step, rebuilding the database's file state in memory. This ensures that LevelDB knows exactly which SSTable files were live when it last shut down (or crashed).
245: 
246: Occasionally, the `MANIFEST` file can grow large. LevelDB might then write a *snapshot* of the entire current state (all files in all levels) as a single large record into a *new* `MANIFEST` file and then switch subsequent edits to that new file. This prevents the recovery process from becoming too slow.
247: 
248: ## Conclusion
249: 
250: `Version`, `VersionEdit`, and `VersionSet` form the core cataloguing system of LevelDB.
251: 
252: *   **Version:** An immutable snapshot of which SSTable files exist at each level. Used by reads to find data.
253: *   **VersionEdit:** A description of changes (files added/deleted, metadata updated) between versions. Persisted in the `MANIFEST` log.
254: *   **VersionSet:** Manages the `current` Version, applies edits to create new versions, handles recovery from the `MANIFEST`, and manages metadata like file numbers and sequence numbers.
255: 
256: Together, they allow LevelDB to manage a constantly changing set of files on disk while providing consistent views for read operations and ensuring the database state can be recovered after a restart.
257: 
258: Now that we understand how LevelDB finds data (checking MemTables, then using the current `Version` to check SSTables via the `TableCache`), how does it provide a way to *scan* through data, not just get single keys?

  8: # Chapter 7: Iterator - Your Guide Through the Database
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 6: Version & VersionSet](06_version___versionset.md), we learned how LevelDB keeps track of all the live SSTable files using `Version` objects and the `VersionSet`. This catalog helps LevelDB efficiently find a single key by looking first in the [MemTable](02_memtable.md) and then pinpointing the right [SSTables](01_table___sstable___tablecache.md) to check.
 11: 
 12: But what if you don't want just *one* key? What if you want to see *all* the key-value pairs in the database, or all the keys within a specific range?
 13: 
 14: ## What's the Problem? Scanning Multiple Keys
 15: 
 16: Imagine you have a database storing user scores, with keys like `score:userA`, `score:userB`, `score:userC`, etc. How would you find all the users whose usernames start with 'user'? Or how would you list all scores from highest to lowest?
 17: 
 18: Calling `db->Get()` repeatedly for every possible key isn't practical or efficient. We need a way to easily **scan** or **traverse** through the key-value pairs stored in the database, in sorted order.
 19: 
 20: Furthermore, this scan needs to be smart. It has to combine the data from the current MemTable (the fast notepad), potentially an older immutable MemTable, and all the different SSTable files on disk. It also needs to correctly handle situations where a key was updated or deleted – showing you only the *latest* live version of the data, just like `Get` does.
 21: 
 22: ## Iterator: Your Database Research Assistant
 23: 
 24: LevelDB provides the `Iterator` concept to solve this. Think of an `Iterator` as a **super-smart research assistant**.
 25: 
 26: You tell the assistant what you're looking for (e.g., "start from the beginning" or "find keys starting with 'user'"). The assistant then efficiently looks through the current notepad (`MemTable`), the previous notepad (`imm_`), and all the relevant books on the shelves (`SSTables`), using the latest catalog (`Version`).
 27: 
 28: As the assistant finds relevant entries, it presents them to you one by one, in perfect sorted order by key. Crucially, the assistant knows how to:
 29: 
 30: 1.  **Merge Sources:** Combine results from memory (MemTable) and disk (SSTables) seamlessly.
 31: 2.  **Handle Versions:** If the same key exists in multiple places (e.g., an old value in an SSTable and a newer value in the MemTable), the assistant only shows you the *most recent* one based on the database's internal sequence numbers.
 32: 3.  **Handle Deletions:** If a key has been deleted, the assistant knows to *skip* it entirely, even if older versions of the key exist in SSTables.
 33: 4.  **Provide a Snapshot:** An iterator typically operates on a consistent snapshot of the database. Data added *after* the iterator was created won't suddenly appear during your scan.
 34: 
 35: The main iterator you interact with, obtained via `db->NewIterator()`, is often implemented internally by a class called `DBIter`. `DBIter` coordinates the work of lower-level iterators.
 36: 
 37: ## How to Use an Iterator
 38: 
 39: Using an iterator is quite straightforward. Here's a typical pattern:
 40: 
 41: ```c++
 42: #include "leveldb/db.h"
 43: #include "leveldb/iterator.h"
 44: #include <iostream>
 45: 
 46: // ... assume db is an open LevelDB database ...
 47: 
 48: // 1. Create an iterator
 49: leveldb::ReadOptions options;
 50: // options.snapshot = db->GetSnapshot(); // Optional: Use a specific snapshot
 51: leveldb::Iterator* it = db->NewIterator(options);
 52: 
 53: // 2. Position the iterator (e.g., seek to the first key >= "start_key")
 54: std::string start_key = "user:";
 55: it->Seek(start_key);
 56: 
 57: // 3. Loop through the keys
 58: std::cout << "Keys starting with '" << start_key << "':" << std::endl;
 59: for (; it->Valid(); it->Next()) {
 60:   leveldb::Slice key = it->key();
 61:   leveldb::Slice value = it->value();
 62: 
 63:   // Optional: Stop if we go past the desired range
 64:   if (!key.starts_with(start_key)) {
 65:      break;
 66:   }
 67: 
 68:   std::cout << key.ToString() << " => " << value.ToString() << std::endl;
 69: }
 70: 
 71: // 4. Check for errors (optional but recommended)
 72: if (!it->status().ok()) {
 73:   std::cerr << "Iterator error: " << it->status().ToString() << std::endl;
 74: }
 75: 
 76: // 5. Clean up the iterator and snapshot (if used)
 77: delete it;
 78: // if (options.snapshot != nullptr) {
 79: //   db->ReleaseSnapshot(options.snapshot);
 80: // }
 81: ```
 82: 
 83: **Explanation:**
 84: 
 85: 1.  **`db->NewIterator(options)`:** You ask the database for a new iterator. You can pass `ReadOptions`, optionally including a specific snapshot you obtained earlier using `db->GetSnapshot()`. If you don't provide a snapshot, the iterator uses an implicit snapshot of the database state at the time of creation.
 86: 2.  **Positioning:**
 87:     *   `it->Seek(slice)`: Moves the iterator to the first key-value pair whose key is greater than or equal to the `slice`.
 88:     *   `it->SeekToFirst()`: Moves to the very first key-value pair in the database.
 89:     *   `it->SeekToLast()`: Moves to the very last key-value pair.
 90: 3.  **Looping:**
 91:     *   `it->Valid()`: Returns `true` if the iterator is currently pointing to a valid key-value pair, `false` otherwise (e.g., if you've reached the end).
 92:     *   `it->Next()`: Moves the iterator to the next key-value pair in sorted order.
 93:     *   `it->Prev()`: Moves to the previous key-value pair (less common, but supported).
 94:     *   `it->key()`: Returns a `Slice` representing the current key.
 95:     *   `it->value()`: Returns a `Slice` representing the current value. **Important:** The `Slice`s returned by `key()` and `value()` are only valid until the next call that modifies the iterator (`Next`, `Prev`, `Seek`, etc.). If you need to keep the data longer, make a copy (e.g., `key.ToString()`).
 96: 4.  **`it->status()`:** After the loop, check this to see if any errors occurred during iteration (e.g., disk corruption).
 97: 5.  **`delete it;`:** Crucially, you **must** delete the iterator when you're done with it to free up resources. If you used an explicit snapshot, release it too.
 98: 
 99: This simple interface lets you scan through potentially vast amounts of data spread across memory and disk files without needing to know the complex details of where each piece resides.
100: 
101: ## Under the Hood: Merging and Filtering
102: 
103: How does the iterator provide this unified, sorted view? It doesn't load everything into memory! Instead, it uses a clever strategy involving **merging** and **filtering**.
104: 
105: 1.  **Gather Internal Iterators:** When you call `db->NewIterator()`, the `DBImpl` asks for iterators from all the relevant sources, based on the current [Version](06_version___versionset.md):
106:     *   An iterator for the active `MemTable`.
107:     *   An iterator for the immutable `imm_` (if it exists).
108:     *   Iterators for all the files in Level-0.
109:     *   A special "concatenating" iterator for Level-1 (which opens SSTable files lazily as needed).
110:     *   Similar concatenating iterators for Level-2, Level-3, etc.
111: 
112: 2.  **Create MergingIterator:** These individual iterators are then passed to a `MergingIterator`. The `MergingIterator` acts like a zipper, taking multiple sorted streams and producing a single output stream that is also sorted. It keeps track of the current position in each input iterator and always yields the smallest key currently available across all inputs.
113: 
114: 3.  **Wrap with DBIter:** The `MergingIterator` produces *internal* keys (with sequence numbers and types). This merged stream is then wrapped by the `DBIter`. `DBIter` is the "research assistant" we talked about. It reads the stream from the `MergingIterator` and performs the final filtering:
115:     *   It compares the sequence number of each internal key with the iterator's snapshot sequence number. Keys newer than the snapshot are ignored.
116:     *   It keeps track of the current user key. If it sees multiple versions of the same user key, it only considers the one with the highest sequence number (that's still <= the snapshot sequence).
117:     *   If the most recent entry for a user key is a deletion marker (`kTypeDeletion`), it skips that key entirely.
118:     *   Only when it finds a valid, non-deleted key (`kTypeValue`) with the highest sequence number for that user key (within the snapshot) does it make that key/value available via `it->key()` and `it->value()`.

164: ## Code Dive: `DBImpl::NewIterator` and `DBIter`
165: 
166: Let's look at how this is initiated in the code.
167: 
168: **1. Creating the Iterator (`db_impl.cc`)**
169: 
170: When you call `db->NewIterator(options)`, it eventually calls `DBImpl::NewIterator`:
171: 
172: ```c++
173: // --- File: db/db_impl.cc ---
174: 
175: Iterator* DBImpl::NewIterator(const ReadOptions& options) {
176:   SequenceNumber latest_snapshot;
177:   uint32_t seed; // Used for read sampling randomization
178: 
179:   // (1) Create the internal merging iterator
180:   Iterator* internal_iter = NewInternalIterator(options, &latest_snapshot, &seed);
181: 
182:   // (2) Determine the sequence number for the snapshot
183:   SequenceNumber snapshot_seq =
184:       (options.snapshot != nullptr
185:            ? static_cast<const SnapshotImpl*>(options.snapshot)
186:                  ->sequence_number()
187:            : latest_snapshot);
188: 
189:   // (3) Wrap the internal iterator with DBIter
190:   return NewDBIterator(this, // Pass DBImpl pointer for read sampling
191:                        user_comparator(),
192:                        internal_iter,
193:                        snapshot_seq,
194:                        seed);
195: }
196: ```
197: 
198: **Explanation:**
199: 
200: 1.  `NewInternalIterator`: This helper function (we'll glance at it next) creates the `MergingIterator` that combines MemTables and SSTables.
201: 2.  `snapshot_seq`: It figures out which sequence number to use. If the user provided an explicit `options.snapshot`, it uses that snapshot's sequence number. Otherwise, it uses the latest sequence number in the database when the iterator was created (`latest_snapshot`).
202: 3.  `NewDBIterator`: This function (defined in `db_iter.cc`) creates the `DBIter` object, passing it the underlying `internal_iter` and the `snapshot_seq` to use for filtering.
203: 
204: **2. Creating the Internal Iterator (`db_impl.cc`)**
205: 
206: The `NewInternalIterator` gathers all the source iterators:
207: 
208: ```c++
209: // --- File: db/db_impl.cc ---
210: 
211: Iterator* DBImpl::NewInternalIterator(const ReadOptions& options,
212:                                       SequenceNumber* latest_snapshot,
213:                                       uint32_t* seed) {
214:   mutex_.Lock(); // Need lock to access shared state (mem_, imm_, versions_)
215:   *latest_snapshot = versions_->LastSequence();
216:   *seed = ++seed_; // For random sampling
217: 
218:   // Collect together all needed child iterators
219:   std::vector<Iterator*> list;
220:   // Add iterator for active MemTable
221:   list.push_back(mem_->NewIterator());
222:   mem_->Ref(); // Manage lifetime with ref counting
223: 
224:   // Add iterator for immutable MemTable (if it exists)
225:   if (imm_ != nullptr) {
226:     list.push_back(imm_->NewIterator());
227:     imm_->Ref();
228:   }
229: 
230:   // Add iterators for all SSTable files in the current Version
231:   versions_->current()->AddIterators(options, &list);
232:   versions_->current()->Ref();
233: 
234:   // Create the MergingIterator
235:   Iterator* internal_iter =
236:       NewMergingIterator(&internal_comparator_, &list[0], list.size());
237: 
238:   // Register cleanup function to Unref MemTables/Version when iterator is deleted
239:   IterState* cleanup = new IterState(&mutex_, mem_, imm_, versions_->current());
240:   internal_iter->RegisterCleanup(CleanupIteratorState, cleanup, nullptr);
241: 
242:   mutex_.Unlock();
243:   return internal_iter;
244: }
245: ```
246: 
247: **Explanation:**
248: 
249: 1.  It locks the database mutex to safely access the current MemTables (`mem_`, `imm_`) and the current `Version`.
250: 2.  It creates iterators for `mem_` and `imm_` using their `NewIterator()` methods ([MemTable](02_memtable.md) uses a SkipList iterator).
251: 3.  It calls `versions_->current()->AddIterators(...)`. This method (in `version_set.cc`) adds iterators for Level-0 files and the special concatenating iterators for Levels 1+ to the `list`. See [Version & VersionSet](06_version___versionset.md).
252: 4.  `NewMergingIterator` creates the iterator that merges all sources in `list`.
253: 5.  `RegisterCleanup` ensures that the MemTables and Version are properly `Unref`'d when the iterator is eventually deleted.
254: 6.  It returns the `MergingIterator`.
255: 
256: **3. `DBIter` Filtering Logic (`db_iter.cc`)**
257: 
258: The `DBIter` class takes the `MergingIterator` and applies the filtering logic. Let's look at a simplified `Next()` method:
259: 
260: ```c++
261: // --- File: db/db_iter.cc ---
262: 
263: void DBIter::Next() {
264:   assert(valid_);
265: 
266:   if (direction_ == kReverse) {
267:     // ... code to switch from moving backward to forward ...
268:     // Position iter_ at the first entry >= saved_key_
269:     // Fall through to FindNextUserEntry...
270:     direction_ = kForward;
271:   } else {
272:     // We are moving forward. Save the current user key so we can skip
273:     // all other entries for it.
274:     SaveKey(ExtractUserKey(iter_->key()), &saved_key_);
275:     // Advance the internal iterator.
276:     iter_->Next();
277:   }
278: 
279:   // Find the next user key entry that is visible at our sequence number.
280:   FindNextUserEntry(true, &saved_key_);
281: }
282: 
283: // Find the next entry for a different user key, skipping deleted
284: // or older versions of the key in 'skip'.
285: void DBIter::FindNextUserEntry(bool skipping, std::string* skip) {
286:   // Loop until we hit an acceptable entry
287:   assert(iter_->Valid() || !valid_); // iter_ might be invalid if Next() moved past end
288:   assert(direction_ == kForward);
289: 
290:   do {
291:     if (!iter_->Valid()) { // Reached end of internal iterator
292:         valid_ = false;
293:         return;
294:     }
295: 
296:     ParsedInternalKey ikey;
297:     // Parse the internal key (key, sequence, type)
298:     if (ParseKey(&ikey)) {
299:       // Check if the sequence number is visible in our snapshot
300:       if (ikey.sequence <= sequence_) {
301:         // Check the type (Put or Deletion)
302:         switch (ikey.type) {
303:           case kTypeDeletion:
304:             // This key is deleted. Save the user key so we skip
305:             // any older versions of it we might encounter later.
306:             SaveKey(ikey.user_key, skip);
307:             skipping = true; // Ensure we skip older versions
308:             break;
309:           case kTypeValue:
310:             // This is a potential result (a Put operation).
311:             // Is it for the user key we are trying to skip?
312:             if (skipping &&
313:                 user_comparator_->Compare(ikey.user_key, *skip) <= 0) {
314:               // Yes, it's hidden by a newer deletion or is an older version
315:               // of the key we just yielded. Skip it.
316:             } else {
317:               // Found a valid entry!
318:               valid_ = true;
319:               // Clear skip key since we found a new valid key
320:               // saved_key_.clear(); // Done in Next() or Seek()
321:               return; // Exit the loop, iterator is now positioned correctly.
322:             }
323:             break;
324:         }
325:       }
326:     } else {
327:       // Corrupted key, mark iterator as invalid
328:       valid_ = false;
329:       status_ = Status::Corruption("corrupted internal key in DBIter");
330:       return;
331:     }
332: 
333:     // Current internal key was skipped (too new, deleted, hidden), move to next.
334:     iter_->Next();
335:   } while (true); // Loop until we return or reach the end
336: }
337: 
338: ```
339: 
340: **Explanation:**
341: 
342: *   The `Next()` method first handles switching direction if needed. If moving forward, it saves the current user key (`saved_key_`) so it can skip other entries for the same key. It then advances the underlying `iter_` (the `MergingIterator`).
343: *   `FindNextUserEntry` is the core loop. It repeatedly gets the next entry from `iter_`.
344: *   `ParseKey(&ikey)` decodes the internal key, sequence number, and type.
345: *   It checks if `ikey.sequence <= sequence_` (the iterator's snapshot sequence number). If the entry is too new, it's skipped.
346: *   If it's a `kTypeDeletion`, the user key is saved in `skip`, and the `skipping` flag is set to true. Any older entries for this `user_key` will be ignored.
347: *   If it's a `kTypeValue`:
348:     *   It checks if `skipping` is true and if the current `ikey.user_key` is less than or equal to the key in `skip`. If so, it means this entry is hidden by a newer deletion or is an older version of a key we just processed, so it's skipped.
349:     *   Otherwise, this is the newest, visible version of this user key! The loop terminates, `valid_` is set to true, and the `DBIter` is now positioned at this entry.
350: *   If the current entry from `iter_` was skipped for any reason, the loop continues by calling `iter_->Next()`.
351: 
352: This careful dance ensures that `DBIter` only exposes the correct, latest, non-deleted user key/value pairs according to the snapshot sequence number, while efficiently merging data from all underlying sources.
353: 
354: ## Conclusion
355: 
356: LevelDB's `Iterator` provides a powerful and convenient way to scan through key-value pairs. It acts like a smart assistant, giving you a unified, sorted view across data stored in the `MemTable` and numerous `SSTable` files.
357: 
358: Under the hood, it uses a `MergingIterator` to combine multiple sorted sources and the `DBIter` wrapper to filter out deleted entries and older versions based on sequence numbers and the requested snapshot.
359: 
360: This ability to efficiently scan sorted data is not just useful for application queries, but it's also fundamental to how LevelDB maintains itself. How does LevelDB merge old SSTables and incorporate data flushed from the MemTable to keep the database structure efficient? It uses these very same iterator concepts!

  8: # Chapter 8: Compaction - Keeping the Library Tidy
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 7: Iterator](07_iterator.md), we saw how LevelDB provides iterators to give us a unified, sorted view of our data, cleverly merging information from the in-memory [MemTable](02_memtable.md) and the various [SSTable](01_table___sstable___tablecache.md) files on disk.
 11: 
 12: This works great, but think about what happens over time. Every time a MemTable fills up, it gets flushed to a *new* SSTable file in Level-0. If you have lots of writes, you'll quickly accumulate many small files in Level-0. Also, when you update or delete a key, LevelDB doesn't modify old SSTables; it just writes a *new* entry (a new value or a deletion marker) in a newer MemTable or SSTable. This means older files contain outdated or deleted data that's just taking up space.
 13: 
 14: ## What's the Problem? A Messy, Inefficient Library
 15: 
 16: Imagine our library again. New notes and pamphlets (MemTable flushes) keep arriving and get dumped in a temporary pile (Level-0). Meanwhile, older books on the main shelves (higher levels) contain crossed-out paragraphs (deleted data) or outdated information (overwritten data).
 17: 
 18: This leads to several problems:
 19: 
 20: 1.  **Slow Reads:** To find a specific piece of information, the librarian might have to check *many* different pamphlets in the temporary pile (Level-0) before even getting to the main shelves. Reading from many files is slow.
 21: 2.  **Wasted Space:** The library shelves are cluttered with books containing crossed-out sections or old editions that are no longer needed. This wastes valuable shelf space.
 22: 3.  **Growing Number of Files:** The temporary pile (Level-0) just keeps growing, making it harder and harder to manage.
 23: 
 24: We need a process to periodically tidy up this library, organize the temporary pile into the main shelves, and remove the outdated information.
 25: 
 26: ## Compaction: The Background Tidy-Up Crew
 27: 
 28: **Compaction** is LevelDB's background process that solves these problems. It's like the library staff who work quietly behind the scenes to keep the library organized and efficient.
 29: 
 30: Here's what compaction does:
 31: 
 32: 1.  **Selects Files:** It picks one or more SSTable files from a specific level (let's say Level-N). Often, this starts with files in Level-0.
 33: 2.  **Finds Overlapping Files:** It identifies the files in the *next* level (Level-N+1) whose key ranges overlap with the selected files from Level-N.
 34: 3.  **Merges and Filters:** It reads the key-value pairs from *all* these selected files (from both Level-N and Level-N+1) using iterators, much like the merging process we saw in [Chapter 7: Iterator](07_iterator.md). As it merges, it performs crucial filtering:
 35:     *   It keeps only the *latest* version of each key (based on sequence numbers).
 36:     *   It completely discards keys that have been deleted.
 37:     *   It discards older versions of keys that have been updated.
 38: 4.  **Writes New Files:** It writes the resulting stream of filtered, sorted key-value pairs into *new* SSTable files at Level-N+1. These new files are typically larger and contain only live data.
 39: 5.  **Updates Catalog:** It updates the database's catalog ([Version & VersionSet](06_version___versionset.md)) to reflect the changes: the old input files (from Level-N and Level-N+1) are marked for deletion, and the new output files (in Level-N+1) are added.
 40: 6.  **Deletes Old Files:** Finally, the old, now-obsolete input SSTable files are deleted from the disk.
 41: 
 42: **Analogy:** The library staff takes a batch of pamphlets from the temporary pile (Level-0) and finds the corresponding books on the main shelves (Level-1). They go through both, creating a new, clean edition of the book (new Level-1 SSTable) that incorporates the new information from the pamphlets, removes any crossed-out entries, and keeps only the latest version of each topic. Then, they discard the original pamphlets and the old version of the book.
 43: 
 44: This process happens continuously in the background, keeping the database structure efficient.
 45: 
 46: ## Triggering Compaction: When to Tidy Up?
 47: 
 48: How does LevelDB decide when to run a compaction? The [DBImpl](04_dbimpl.md) checks if compaction is needed after writes or reads, or when background work finishes. It uses the [VersionSet](06_version___versionset.md) to determine this, primarily based on two conditions:
 49: 
 50: 1.  **Size Compaction:** Each level (except Level-0) has a target size limit. If the total size of files in a level exceeds its limit, the `VersionSet` calculates a "compaction score". If the score is >= 1, a size compaction is needed. This is the most common trigger. Level-0 is special: it triggers compaction based on the *number* of files, not their total size, because too many files there significantly slows down reads.
 51:     *   `config::kL0_CompactionTrigger`: Default is 4 files.
 52:     *   Higher levels (1+): Trigger based on total bytes (`MaxBytesForLevel`).
 53: 2.  **Seek Compaction:** To avoid performance issues caused by reading very wide (many keys) but shallow (few overwrites/deletions) files repeatedly, LevelDB tracks how many times a file is "seeked" during reads. If a file receives too many seeks (`allowed_seeks` counter drops to zero), it might be chosen for compaction even if the level size limit isn't reached. This helps rewrite files that are frequently accessed, potentially merging them or breaking them up.
 54: 
 55: When `DBImpl::MaybeScheduleCompaction` detects that work is needed (and no other background work is running), it schedules the `DBImpl::BGWork` function to run on a background thread.
 56: 
 57: ```c++
 58: // --- Simplified from db/db_impl.cc ---
 59: 
 60: void DBImpl::MaybeScheduleCompaction() {
 61:   mutex_.AssertHeld(); // Must hold lock to check/change state
 62: 
 63:   if (background_compaction_scheduled_) {
 64:     // Already scheduled
 65:   } else if (shutting_down_.load(std::memory_order_acquire)) {
 66:     // DB is closing
 67:   } else if (!bg_error_.ok()) {
 68:     // Background error stopped activity
 69:   } else if (imm_ == nullptr && // No MemTable flush needed AND
 70:              manual_compaction_ == nullptr && // No manual request AND
 71:              !versions_->NeedsCompaction()) { // <<-- VersionSet check!
 72:     // No work to be done: VersionSet says size/seek limits are okay.
 73:   } else {
 74:     // Work needs to be done! Schedule it.
 75:     background_compaction_scheduled_ = true;
 76:     env_->Schedule(&DBImpl::BGWork, this); // Ask Env to run BGWork later
 77:   }
 78: }
 79: 
 80: // --- Simplified from db/version_set.h ---
 81: 
 82: // In VersionSet::NeedsCompaction()
 83: bool NeedsCompaction() const {
 84:   Version* v = current_;
 85:   // Check score (size trigger) OR if a file needs compaction due to seeks
 86:   return (v->compaction_score_ >= 1) || (v->file_to_compact_ != nullptr);
 87: }
 88: ```
 89: 
 90: ## The Compaction Process: A Closer Look
 91: 
 92: Let's break down the steps involved when a background compaction runs (specifically a major compaction between levels N and N+1):
 93: 
 94: **1. Picking the Compaction (`VersionSet::PickCompaction`)**
 95: 
 96: The first step is deciding *what* to compact. `VersionSet::PickCompaction` is responsible for this:
 97: 
 98: *   It checks if a seek-based compaction is pending (`file_to_compact_ != nullptr`). If so, it chooses that file and its level.
 99: *   Otherwise, it looks at the `compaction_score_` and `compaction_level_` pre-calculated for the current [Version](06_version___versionset.md). If the score is >= 1, it chooses that level for a size-based compaction.
100: *   It creates a `Compaction` object to hold information about this task.
101: *   It selects an initial set of files from the chosen level (Level-N) to compact. For size compactions, it often picks the file just after the `compact_pointer_` for that level (a bookmark remembering where the last compaction ended) to ensure work spreads across the key range over time.
102: *   For Level-0, since files can overlap, it expands this initial set to include *all* Level-0 files that overlap with the initially chosen file(s).
103: 
104: ```c++
105: // --- Simplified from db/version_set.cc ---
106: 
107: Compaction* VersionSet::PickCompaction() {
108:   Compaction* c = nullptr;
109:   int level;
110: 
111:   // Check for seek-triggered compaction first
112:   const bool seek_compaction = (current_->file_to_compact_ != nullptr);
113:   if (seek_compaction) {
114:     level = current_->file_to_compact_level_;
115:     c = new Compaction(options_, level);
116:     c->inputs_[0].push_back(current_->file_to_compact_); // Add the specific file
117:   } else {
118:     // Check for size-triggered compaction
119:     const bool size_compaction = (current_->compaction_score_ >= 1);
120:     if (!size_compaction) {
121:       return nullptr; // No compaction needed
122:     }
123:     level = current_->compaction_level_;
124:     c = new Compaction(options_, level);
125: 
126:     // Pick starting file in chosen level (often based on compact_pointer_)
127:     // ... logic to select initial file(s) ...
128:     // c->inputs_[0].push_back(chosen_file);
129:   }
130: 
131:   c->input_version_ = current_; // Remember which Version we are compacting
132:   c->input_version_->Ref();
133: 
134:   // Expand Level-0 inputs if necessary due to overlap
135:   if (level == 0) {
136:     InternalKey smallest, largest;
137:     GetRange(c->inputs_[0], &smallest, &largest); // Find range of initial file(s)
138:     // Find ALL L0 files overlapping that range
139:     current_->GetOverlappingInputs(0, &smallest, &largest, &c->inputs_[0]);
140:     assert(!c->inputs_[0].empty());
141:   }
142: 
143:   // Now figure out the overlapping files in the next level (Level+1)
144:   SetupOtherInputs(c);
145:   return c;
146: }
147: ```
148: 
149: **2. Setting Up Inputs (`VersionSet::SetupOtherInputs`)**
150: 
151: Once the initial Level-N files are chosen, `SetupOtherInputs` figures out the rest:
152: 
153: *   It determines the smallest and largest keys covered by the Level-N input files.
154: *   It finds all files in Level-(N+1) that overlap this key range. These become `c->inputs_[1]`.
155: *   It might slightly expand the Level-N inputs if doing so allows including more Level-N files without pulling in any *additional* Level-(N+1) files (this can make compactions more efficient).
156: *   It finds all files in Level-(N+2) that overlap the *total* key range of the compaction. These are the "grandparents". This is important to prevent creating huge files in Level-(N+1) that would overlap too much data in Level-(N+2), making future compactions expensive.
157: 
158: **3. Performing the Work (`DBImpl::DoCompactionWork`)**
159: 
160: This is where the main merging happens. It runs on the background thread, and importantly, it **releases the main database lock** (`mutex_.Unlock()`) while doing the heavy I/O.
161: 
162: *   **Input Iterator:** Creates a `MergingIterator` ([Chapter 7: Iterator](07_iterator.md)) that reads from all input files (Level-N and Level-N+1) as a single sorted stream (`versions_->MakeInputIterator(compact)`).
163: *   **Snapshot:** Determines the oldest sequence number needed by any existing snapshot (`compact->smallest_snapshot`). Entries older than this can potentially be dropped even if not deleted.
164: *   **Loop:** Iterates through the `MergingIterator`:
165:     *   Reads the next internal key/value.
166:     *   **Parses Key:** Extracts user key, sequence number, and type.
167:     *   **Checks for Stop:** Decides if the current output file should be finished and a new one started (e.g., due to size limits or too much overlap with grandparents).
168:     *   **Drop Logic:** Determines if the current entry should be dropped:
169:         *   Is it a deletion marker for a key that has no older data in lower levels (`IsBaseLevelForKey`) and is older than the oldest snapshot? (Obsolete deletion marker).
170:         *   Is it an entry for a key where we've already seen a *newer* entry during this same compaction?
171:         *   Is it older than the `smallest_snapshot` AND we've already seen a newer entry for this key (even if that newer entry was also dropped)?
172:     *   **Keep Logic:** If the entry is not dropped:
173:         *   Opens a new output SSTable file in Level-(N+1) if one isn't already open (`OpenCompactionOutputFile`).
174:         *   Adds the key/value pair to the `TableBuilder` (`compact->builder->Add`).
175:         *   Updates the smallest/largest keys for the output file metadata.
176:         *   Closes the output file if it reaches the target size (`FinishCompactionOutputFile`).
177:     *   Moves to the next input entry (`input->Next()`).
178: *   **Finish:** Writes the last output file.
179: *   **Status:** Checks for errors from the input iterator or file writes.
180: 
181: ```c++
182: // --- Highly simplified loop from db/db_impl.cc DoCompactionWork ---
183: 
184: // Create iterator over Level-N and Level-N+1 input files
185: Iterator* input = versions_->MakeInputIterator(compact->compaction);
186: input->SeekToFirst();
187: 
188: // ... Release Mutex ...
189: 
190: while (input->Valid() && !shutting_down_) {
191:   Slice key = input->key();
192:   Slice value = input->value();
193: 
194:   // Should we finish the current output file and start a new one?
195:   if (compact->compaction->ShouldStopBefore(key) && compact->builder != nullptr) {
196:     status = FinishCompactionOutputFile(compact, input);
197:     // ... handle status ...
198:   }
199: 
200:   // Should we drop this key/value pair?
201:   bool drop = false;
202:   if (ParseInternalKey(key, &ikey)) {
203:       // Logic based on ikey.sequence, ikey.type, smallest_snapshot,
204:       // last_sequence_for_key, IsBaseLevelForKey...
205:       // drop = true if this entry is deleted, shadowed, or obsolete.
206:   } else {
207:       // Corrupt key? Maybe keep it? (See actual code for details)
208:   }
209: 
210:   if (!drop) {
211:     // Open output file if needed
212:     if (compact->builder == nullptr) {
213:       status = OpenCompactionOutputFile(compact);
214:       // ... handle status ...
215:     }
216:     // Add key/value to the output file being built
217:     compact->builder->Add(key, value);
218:     // ... update output file metadata (smallest/largest key) ...
219: 
220:     // Close output file if it's big enough
221:     if (compact->builder->FileSize() >= compact->compaction->MaxOutputFileSize()) {
222:       status = FinishCompactionOutputFile(compact, input);
223:       // ... handle status ...
224:     }
225:   }
226: 
227:   // Advance to the next key in the merged input stream
228:   input->Next();
229: }
230: 
231: // ... Finish the last output file ...
232: // ... Check input iterator status ...
233: delete input;
234: 
235: // ... Re-acquire Mutex ...
236: ```
237: 
238: **4. Installing Results (`DBImpl::InstallCompactionResults`)**
239: 
240: If the compaction work finished successfully:
241: 
242: *   A `VersionEdit` is created.
243: *   It records the deletion of all input files (from Level-N and Level-N+1).
244: *   It records the addition of all the newly created output files (in Level-N+1), including their file numbers, sizes, and key ranges.
245: *   `VersionSet::LogAndApply` is called to:
246:     *   Write the `VersionEdit` to the `MANIFEST` file.
247:     *   Create a new `Version` reflecting these changes.
248:     *   Make this new `Version` the `current` one.
249: 
250: **5. Cleaning Up (`DBImpl::RemoveObsoleteFiles`)**
251: 
252: After the new `Version` is successfully installed:
253: 
254: *   `DBImpl` calls `RemoveObsoleteFiles`.
255: *   This function gets the list of all files needed by *any* live `Version` (including those held by snapshots or iterators).
256: *   It compares this list with the actual files in the database directory.
257: *   Any file that exists on disk but is *not* in the live set (like the input files from the just-completed compaction) is deleted from the filesystem.

298: 
299: ## Conclusion
300: 
301: Compaction is the essential background process that keeps LevelDB performant and prevents space usage from growing indefinitely due to old data. It intelligently merges files between levels, filtering out deleted and overwritten entries while preserving a consistent view for readers.
302: 
303: *   It's triggered by level size or file access patterns.
304: *   It uses iterators to merge input files efficiently.
305: *   It drops obsolete data based on sequence numbers and deletion markers.
306: *   It writes new, clean SSTable files to the next level.
307: *   It atomically updates the database state using `VersionEdit`s, the `MANIFEST`, and the `VersionSet`.
308: 
309: Understanding compaction helps explain how LevelDB achieves good performance despite its append-only (immutable SSTable) design.
310: 
311: But how does LevelDB manage those sequence numbers and deletion markers internally? How does it combine a user's key with this metadata?

  8: # Chapter 9: InternalKey & DBFormat - LevelDB's Internal Bookkeeping
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the final chapter of our deep dive into LevelDB's core components! In [Chapter 8: Compaction](08_compaction.md), we saw how LevelDB keeps its storage tidy by merging and rewriting [SSTables](01_table___sstable___tablecache.md) in the background. This compaction process relies heavily on being able to correctly compare different versions of the same key and discard old or deleted data.
 11: 
 12: But how does LevelDB know which version of a key is newer? If you write `("mykey", "value1")` and later `("mykey", "value2")`, how does LevelDB know that `value2` is the current one? And how does it handle `Delete("mykey")`? It can't just erase entries from immutable SSTable files.
 13: 
 14: ## What's the Problem? Tracking Versions and Deletions
 15: 
 16: Imagine a simple library catalog that only lists book titles (user keys) and their shelf locations (user values).
 17: 1.  You add "Adventures of Tom Sawyer" on Shelf A. Catalog: `("Tom Sawyer", "Shelf A")`
 18: 2.  Later, you move it to Shelf B. If you just add `("Tom Sawyer", "Shelf B")`, how do you know Shelf A is wrong? The catalog now has two entries!
 19: 3.  Later still, you remove the book entirely. How do you mark this in the catalog?
 20: 
 21: Just storing the user's key and value isn't enough. LevelDB needs extra internal bookkeeping information attached to every entry to handle updates, deletions, and also [Snapshots](07_iterator.md) (reading the database as it was at a specific point in time).
 22: 
 23: ## The Solution: Sequence Numbers and Value Types
 24: 
 25: LevelDB solves this by adding two extra pieces of information to every key-value pair internally:
 26: 
 27: 1.  **Sequence Number:** Think of this like a **unique version number** or a **timestamp** assigned to every modification. Every time you `Put` or `Delete` data (usually as part of a [WriteBatch](05_writebatch.md)), LevelDB assigns a strictly increasing sequence number to that operation. A higher sequence number means the operation happened more recently. This number increments globally for the entire database.
 28: 
 29: 2.  **Value Type:** This is a simple flag indicating whether an entry represents a **value** or a **deletion**.
 30:     *   `kTypeValue`: Represents a regular key-value pair resulting from a `Put`.
 31:     *   `kTypeDeletion`: Represents a "tombstone" marker indicating that a key was deleted by a `Delete` operation.
 32: 
 33: ## InternalKey: The Full Story
 34: 
 35: LevelDB combines the user's key with these two extra pieces of information into a structure called an **InternalKey**.
 36: 
 37: **InternalKey = `user_key` + `sequence_number` + `value_type`**
 38: 
 39: This `InternalKey` is what LevelDB *actually* stores and sorts within the [MemTable](02_memtable.md) and [SSTables](01_table___sstable___tablecache.md). When you ask LevelDB for `Get("mykey")`, it internally searches for `InternalKey`s associated with `"mykey"` and uses the sequence numbers and value types to figure out the correct, most recent state.
 40: 
 41: ## Sorting InternalKeys: The Magic Ingredient
 42: 
 43: How `InternalKey`s are sorted is crucial for LevelDB's efficiency. They are sorted based on the following rules:
 44: 
 45: 1.  **User Key:** First, compare the `user_key` part using the standard comparator you configured for the database (e.g., lexicographical order). Keys `apple` come before `banana`.
 46: 2.  **Sequence Number (Descending):** If the user keys are the same, compare the `sequence_number` in **DESCENDING** order. The entry with the *highest* sequence number comes *first*.
 47: 3.  **Value Type (Descending):** If user keys and sequence numbers are the same (which shouldn't normally happen for distinct operations), compare the `value_type` in **DESCENDING** order (`kTypeValue` comes before `kTypeDeletion`).
 48: 
 49: **Why sort sequence numbers descending?** Because when LevelDB looks for a user key, it wants to find the *most recent* version first. By sorting the highest sequence number first, a simple search or iteration naturally encounters the latest state of the key immediately.
 50: 
 51: **Example:** Let's revisit our `Put`/`Put`/`Delete` example for `mykey`:
 52: 1. `Put("mykey", "v1")` -> gets Sequence = 5 -> InternalKey: `("mykey", 5, kTypeValue)`
 53: 2. `Put("mykey", "v2")` -> gets Sequence = 10 -> InternalKey: `("mykey", 10, kTypeValue)`
 54: 3. `Delete("mykey")` -> gets Sequence = 15 -> InternalKey: `("mykey", 15, kTypeDeletion)`
 55: 
 56: When these are sorted according to the rules, the order is:
 57: 1. `("mykey", 15, kTypeDeletion)` (Highest sequence)
 58: 2. `("mykey", 10, kTypeValue)`
 59: 3. `("mykey", 5, kTypeValue)` (Lowest sequence)
 60: 
 61: Now, when you call `Get("mykey")`:
 62: *   LevelDB searches for entries matching `mykey`.
 63: *   It finds `("mykey", 15, kTypeDeletion)` first because it sorts first.
 64: *   It sees the `kTypeDeletion` marker and immediately knows the key is deleted, returning `NotFound` without even needing to look at the older versions (`v2` and `v1`).
 65: 
 66: **Snapshots:** Snapshots work by using a specific sequence number. If you take a snapshot at sequence 12, a `Get("mykey")` using that snapshot would ignore sequence 15. It would find `("mykey", 10, kTypeValue)` first, see it's `kTypeValue` and `sequence <= 12`, and return `"v2"`.
 67: 
 68: ## The `dbformat` Module: Defining the Rules
 69: 
 70: The code that defines the `InternalKey` structure, the `ValueType` enum, sequence numbers, helper functions for manipulating them, and crucial constants is located in `dbformat.h` and `dbformat.cc`.
 71: 
 72: **1. Key Structures and Constants (`dbformat.h`)**
 73: 
 74: This header file defines the core types:
 75: 
 76: ```c++
 77: // --- File: db/dbformat.h ---
 78: 
 79: namespace leveldb {
 80: 
 81: // Value types: Deletion or Value
 82: enum ValueType { kTypeDeletion = 0x0, kTypeValue = 0x1 };
 83: 
 84: // ValueType used for seeking. (Uses highest type value)
 85: static const ValueType kValueTypeForSeek = kTypeValue;
 86: 
 87: // Type for sequence numbers. 56 bits available.
 88: typedef uint64_t SequenceNumber;
 89: 
 90: // Max possible sequence number.
 91: static const SequenceNumber kMaxSequenceNumber = ((0x1ull << 56) - 1);
 92: 
 93: // Structure to hold the parsed parts of an InternalKey
 94: struct ParsedInternalKey {
 95:   Slice user_key;
 96:   SequenceNumber sequence;
 97:   ValueType type;
 98: 
 99:   // Constructors... DebugString()...
100: };
101: 
102: // Helper class to manage the encoded string representation
103: class InternalKey {
104:  private:
105:   std::string rep_; // Holds the encoded key: user_key + seq/type tag
106:  public:
107:   // Constructors... DecodeFrom()... Encode()... user_key()...
108:   InternalKey(const Slice& user_key, SequenceNumber s, ValueType t);
109: };
110: 
111: // ... other definitions like LookupKey, InternalKeyComparator ...
112: 
113: } // namespace leveldb
114: ```
115: 
116: **Explanation:**
117: *   Defines `ValueType` enum (`kTypeDeletion`, `kTypeValue`).
118: *   Defines `SequenceNumber` (a 64-bit integer, but only 56 bits are used, leaving 8 bits for the type).
119: *   `ParsedInternalKey`: A temporary struct holding the three components separately.
120: *   `InternalKey`: A class that usually stores the *encoded* form (as a single string) for efficiency.
121: 
122: **2. Encoding and Parsing (`dbformat.cc`, `dbformat.h`)**
123: 
124: LevelDB needs to combine the three parts (`user_key`, `sequence`, `type`) into a single `Slice` (a pointer + length, representing a string) for storage and comparison, and then parse them back out. The sequence and type are packed together into the last 8 bytes of the internal key string.
125: 
126: ```c++
127: // --- File: db/dbformat.h --- (Inline functions)
128: 
129: // Combine sequence and type into 8 bytes (64 bits)
130: static uint64_t PackSequenceAndType(uint64_t seq, ValueType t) {
131:   // seq uses upper 56 bits, type uses lower 8 bits
132:   return (seq << 8) | t;
133: }
134: 
135: // Extract the user_key part from an encoded internal key
136: inline Slice ExtractUserKey(const Slice& internal_key) {
137:   assert(internal_key.size() >= 8);
138:   return Slice(internal_key.data(), internal_key.size() - 8); // All bytes EXCEPT the last 8
139: }
140: 
141: // --- File: db/dbformat.cc ---
142: 
143: // Append the encoded internal key to a string 'result'
144: void AppendInternalKey(std::string* result, const ParsedInternalKey& key) {
145:   result->append(key.user_key.data(), key.user_key.size()); // Append user key
146:   // Append the 8-byte packed sequence and type
147:   PutFixed64(result, PackSequenceAndType(key.sequence, key.type));
148: }
149: 
150: // Parse an encoded internal key 'internal_key' into 'result'
151: bool ParseInternalKey(const Slice& internal_key, ParsedInternalKey* result) {
152:   const size_t n = internal_key.size();
153:   if (n < 8) return false; // Must have the 8-byte trailer
154:   // Decode the 8-byte trailer
155:   uint64_t num = DecodeFixed64(internal_key.data() + n - 8);
156:   uint8_t c = num & 0xff; // Lower 8 bits are the type
157:   result->sequence = num >> 8; // Upper 56 bits are sequence
158:   result->type = static_cast<ValueType>(c);
159:   result->user_key = Slice(internal_key.data(), n - 8); // The rest is user key
160:   return (c <= static_cast<uint8_t>(kTypeValue)); // Basic validation
161: }
162: ```
163: 
164: **Explanation:**
165: *   `PackSequenceAndType`: Shifts the sequence number left by 8 bits and combines it with the 1-byte type.
166: *   `AppendInternalKey`: Builds the string representation: user key bytes followed by the 8-byte packed sequence/type.
167: *   `ExtractUserKey`: Returns a slice pointing to the user key portion (all but the last 8 bytes).
168: *   `ParseInternalKey`: Does the reverse of `AppendInternalKey`, extracting the parts from the encoded slice.
169: 
170: **3. Comparing Internal Keys (`dbformat.cc`)**
171: 
172: The `InternalKeyComparator` uses the user-provided comparator for the user keys and then implements the descending sequence number logic.
173: 
174: ```c++
175: // --- File: db/dbformat.cc ---
176: 
177: int InternalKeyComparator::Compare(const Slice& akey, const Slice& bkey) const {
178:   // 1. Compare user keys using the user's comparator
179:   int r = user_comparator_->Compare(ExtractUserKey(akey), ExtractUserKey(bkey));
180: 
181:   if (r == 0) {
182:     // User keys are equal, compare sequence numbers (descending)
183:     // Decode the 8-byte tag (seq+type) from the end of each key
184:     const uint64_t anum = DecodeFixed64(akey.data() + akey.size() - 8);
185:     const uint64_t bnum = DecodeFixed64(bkey.data() + bkey.size() - 8);
186:     // Higher sequence number should come first (negative result)
187:     if (anum > bnum) {
188:       r = -1;
189:     } else if (anum < bnum) {
190:       r = +1;
191:     }
192:     // If sequence numbers are also equal, type decides (descending,
193:     // but packed value comparison handles this implicitly).
194:   }
195:   return r;
196: }
197: ```
198: 
199: **Explanation:** This function first compares user keys. If they differ, that result is returned. If they are the same, it decodes the 8-byte tag from both keys and compares them. Since a higher sequence number results in a larger packed `uint64_t` value, comparing `anum` and `bnum` directly and flipping the sign (`-1` if `anum > bnum`, `+1` if `anum < bnum`) achieves the desired descending order for sequence numbers.
200: 
201: **4. Seeking with LookupKey (`dbformat.h`, `dbformat.cc`)**
202: 
203: When you call `Seek(target_key)` on an iterator, LevelDB needs to find the internal key representing the latest version of `target_key` at or before the iterator's snapshot sequence number. Directly seeking using an internal key `(target_key, snapshot_seq, kTypeValue)` might overshoot, landing on an entry *newer* than the snapshot.
204: 
205: `LookupKey` creates a specially formatted key for seeking in MemTables and internal iterators.
206: 
207: ```c++
208: // --- File: db/dbformat.h ---
209: 
210: // A helper class useful for DBImpl::Get() and Iterator::Seek()
211: class LookupKey {
212:  public:
213:   // Create a key for looking up user_key at snapshot 'sequence'.
214:   LookupKey(const Slice& user_key, SequenceNumber sequence);
215:   ~LookupKey();
216: 
217:   // Key for MemTable lookup (includes length prefix for internal key)
218:   Slice memtable_key() const;
219:   // Key for Internal Iterator lookup (user_key + seq/type tag)
220:   Slice internal_key() const;
221:   // User key part
222:   Slice user_key() const;
223: 
224:  private:
225:   const char* start_; // Beginning of allocated buffer
226:   const char* kstart_; // Beginning of user_key portion
227:   const char* end_;   // End of allocated buffer
228:   char space_[200]; // Avoid heap allocation for short keys
229: };
230: 
231: // --- File: db/dbformat.cc --- (Simplified Constructor Logic)
232: 
233: LookupKey::LookupKey(const Slice& user_key, SequenceNumber s) {
234:   size_t usize = user_key.size();
235:   // Need space for: internal key length, user key, 8-byte tag
236:   size_t needed = VarintLength(usize + 8) + usize + 8;
237:   char* dst = /* ... allocate space_ or new char[] ... */ ;
238: 
239:   start_ = dst;
240:   // Encode length of internal key (user_key size + 8)
241:   dst = EncodeVarint32(dst, usize + 8);
242:   kstart_ = dst; // Mark start of internal key part
243:   // Copy user key data
244:   std::memcpy(dst, user_key.data(), usize);
245:   dst += usize;
246:   // Encode the 8-byte tag: Use the target sequence 's' BUT use
247:   // kValueTypeForSeek (which is kTypeValue, the highest type value).
248:   EncodeFixed64(dst, PackSequenceAndType(s, kValueTypeForSeek));
249:   dst += 8;
250:   end_ = dst; // Mark end of buffer
251: }
252: ```
253: 
254: **Explanation:**
255: *   A `LookupKey` bundles the `user_key` with the target `sequence` number.
256: *   Critically, when creating the 8-byte tag, it uses `kValueTypeForSeek`. Because internal keys are sorted by user key, then *descending* sequence, then *descending* type, seeking for `(user_key, sequence, kValueTypeForSeek)` ensures we find the *first* entry whose user key matches and whose sequence number is less than or equal to the target `sequence`. This correctly handles the descending sort order during seeks.
257: 
258: **5. Configuration Constants (`dbformat.h`)**
259: 
260: `dbformat.h` also defines key constants that control LevelDB's behavior, especially related to compaction triggers:
261: 
262: ```c++
263: // --- File: db/dbformat.h ---
264: 
265: namespace config {
266: static const int kNumLevels = 7; // Number of levels in the LSM tree
267: 
268: // Level-0 compaction is started when we hit this many files.
269: static const int kL0_CompactionTrigger = 4;
270: 
271: // Soft limit on number of level-0 files. We slow down writes at this point.
272: static const int kL0_SlowdownWritesTrigger = 8;
273: 
274: // Maximum number of level-0 files. We stop writes at this point.
275: static const int kL0_StopWritesTrigger = 12;
276: 
277: // Maximum level to push a new memtable compaction to if it doesn't overlap.
278: static const int kMaxMemCompactLevel = 2;
279: // ... other constants ...
280: } // namespace config
281: ```
282: 
283: **Explanation:** These constants define parameters like the number of levels and the file count thresholds in Level-0 that trigger compactions or slow down/stop writes. They are part of the database "format" because changing them affects performance and behavior.
284:

307:     end
308: ```
309: 
310: ## Conclusion
311: 
312: LevelDB doesn't just store your raw keys and values. It enhances them internally by adding a **sequence number** (like a version timestamp) and a **value type** (Value or Deletion). This combined structure, the **InternalKey**, is what LevelDB actually sorts and stores in its MemTables and SSTables.
313: 
314: The specific way InternalKeys are sorted (user key ascending, sequence number descending) is critical for efficiently finding the latest version of a key and handling deletions and snapshots correctly. The `dbformat` module (`dbformat.h`, `dbformat.cc`) defines these internal structures, their encoding/decoding rules, the comparison logic (`InternalKeyComparator`), the special `LookupKey` for seeks, and other important constants related to the database's structure and behavior.
315: 
316: Understanding `InternalKey` and `dbformat` reveals the clever bookkeeping that allows LevelDB's Log-Structured Merge-Tree design to function correctly and efficiently. This chapter concludes our tour of the fundamental building blocks of LevelDB!

12: LevelDB<sup>[View Repo](https://github.com/google/leveldb/tree/main/db)</sup> is a fast *key-value storage library* written at Google.
13: Think of it like a simple database where you store pieces of data (values) associated with unique names (keys).
14: It's designed to be **very fast** for both writing new data and reading existing data, and it reliably stores everything on **disk**.
15: It uses a *log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree)* design to achieve high write performance and manages data in sorted files (*SSTables*) across different levels for efficient reads and space management.

  8: # Chapter 1: Your Control Panel - The `mcp` Command-Line Interface
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the MCP Python SDK! This is your starting point for building powerful, interactive AI tools.
 11: 
 12: Imagine you've just built an amazing new tool using the SDK – maybe a helpful assistant that can answer questions about your documents. How do you actually *run* this tool? How do you test it? How do you connect it to applications like Claude Desktop?
 13: 
 14: This is where the `mcp` command-line interface (CLI) comes in. Think of it as your **developer control panel** or **toolkit** for managing your MCP creations right from your terminal (that black window where you type commands). It helps you run, test, and integrate your MCP servers.
 15: 
 16: In this chapter, we'll explore the basic commands you'll use most often. Our main goal is to learn how to take a simple server written in a Python file and get it running.
 17: 
 18: ## What is the `mcp` Command?
 19: 
 20: The `mcp` command is a tool you run in your terminal. After installing the `MCP Python SDK` (specifically with the `cli` extras, like `pip install mcp[cli]`), you gain access to this command. It provides several sub-commands to help you manage your MCP development workflow.
 21: 
 22: Let's look at the most important ones.
 23: 
 24: ### Checking Your Setup: `mcp version`
 25: 
 26: First things first, let's make sure everything is installed correctly. You can check the installed version of the MCP SDK using this command:
 27: 
 28: ```bash
 29: mcp version
 30: ```
 31: 
 32: **What happens?**
 33: 
 34: This command looks up the installed `mcp` package and prints its version number.
 35: 
 36: **Example Output:**
 37: 
 38: ```
 39: MCP version 0.1.0
 40: ```
 41: 
 42: If you see a version number, you're good to go! If you get an error, double-check that you've installed the SDK correctly (`pip install mcp[cli]`).
 43: 
 44: ### Running Your Server: `mcp run`
 45: 
 46: This is the command you'll use to execute your MCP server directly. Let's say you have a Python file named `my_first_server.py` that contains your server code.
 47: 
 48: **Minimal Server Example (`my_first_server.py`):**
 49: 
 50: ```python
 51: # We'll learn about FastMCP in the next chapter!
 52: # For now, just know this creates a basic server.
 53: from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
 54: 
 55: # Create an instance of our server
 56: server = FastMCP(name="MyFirstServer")
 57: 
 58: # This is a standard Python check to make sure
 59: # the script is being run directly
 60: if __name__ == "__main__":
 61:     # Tell the server to start running
 62:     print("Starting MyFirstServer...")
 63:     server.run()
 64:     print("MyFirstServer finished.") # You might not see this if the server runs forever
 65: ```
 66: 
 67: To run this server, you would open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing `my_first_server.py`, and type:
 68: 
 69: ```bash
 70: mcp run my_first_server.py
 71: ```
 72: 
 73: **What happens?**
 74: 
 75: The `mcp run` command will:
 76: 1.  Find your `my_first_server.py` file.
 77: 2.  Look inside for a server object (it tries common names like `mcp`, `server`, or `app` by default, or you can specify one like `my_first_server.py:server`).
 78: 3.  Tell that server object to start running (by calling its `.run()` method).
 79: 
 80: Your terminal will likely show output like "Starting MyFirstServer..." and then wait for connections or instructions, depending on how the server is configured. To stop it, you usually press `Ctrl+C`.
 81: 
 82: ### Developing and Inspecting: `mcp dev`
 83: 
 84: When you're building your server, you often want to see what's happening inside – what messages are being sent and received? The `mcp dev` command is perfect for this. It runs your server *and* launches the **MCP Inspector**, a web-based tool that lets you monitor and debug your server in real-time.
 85: 
 86: ```bash
 87: mcp dev my_first_server.py
 88: ```
 89: 
 90: **What happens?**
 91: 
 92: 1.  Similar to `mcp run`, it finds and prepares to run your server (`my_first_server.py`).
 93: 2.  It ensures any necessary helper tools (like the Inspector itself, using `npx`) are available.
 94: 3.  It starts your server.
 95: 4.  It launches the MCP Inspector, which connects to your running server. You'll usually see a URL in your terminal that you can open in your web browser, or sometimes the Inspector might open automatically.
 96: 
 97: This is incredibly useful during development for understanding the flow of information.
 98: 
 99: *(Note: `mcp dev` might require Node.js and npx to be installed on your system to run the Inspector tool.)*
100: 
101: ### Integrating with Apps: `mcp install`
102: 
103: Once your server is working, you might want to use it from another application, like the Claude Desktop app. The `mcp install` command helps you register your server with Claude so it appears in the app's list of available tools.
104: 
105: ```bash
106: mcp install my_first_server.py --name "My Awesome Tool"
107: ```
108: 
109: **What happens?**
110: 
111: 1.  It finds your `my_first_server.py` file.
112: 2.  It locates the configuration file for the Claude Desktop app on your computer.
113: 3.  It adds an entry to that configuration file, telling Claude:
114:     *   The name you want to use ("My Awesome Tool").
115:     *   How to run your server (using a command like `uv run --with mcp mcp run /path/to/your/my_first_server.py`). `uv` is a fast tool used behind the scenes to manage the environment and dependencies needed to run your server.
116:     *   Optionally, any extra Python packages your server needs (`--with some_package`) or environment variables (`--env-var KEY=VALUE`).
117: 
118: Now, when you open Claude Desktop, "My Awesome Tool" should be available for use! This command essentially automates the process of telling Claude how to find and execute your custom server.
119: 
120: ## How Does `mcp run` Work Under the Hood?
121: 
122: Let's peek behind the curtain when you execute `mcp run my_first_server.py`. It might seem like magic, but it's a well-defined sequence of steps:
123: 
124: 1.  **You type the command:** You enter `mcp run my_first_server.py` in your terminal.
125: 2.  **OS Executes `mcp`:** Your operating system finds the installed `mcp` script (which is part of the `MCP Python SDK`) and runs it using Python.
126: 3.  **`Typer` Parses:** The `mcp` script uses a library called `Typer` to understand the command-line arguments. It sees `run` as the command and `my_first_server.py` as the argument.
127: 4.  **`run` Function Called:** `Typer` directs the execution to the `run` function defined inside the SDK's `cli/cli.py` file.
128: 5.  **Path Processing:** The `run` function calls internal helpers (like `_parse_file_path`) to find the full path to `my_first_server.py` and check if you specified a particular object within the file (e.g., `my_server.py:my_object`).
129: 6.  **Server Import:** It then uses another helper (`_import_server`) to dynamically load the Python code from `my_first_server.py` and find the actual server object (like the `server` variable we created).
130: 7.  **Server Execution:** Finally, it calls the `.run()` method on the imported server object. This is the signal for your server code to start doing its job – listening for connections, processing requests, etc. The specifics of `.run()` depend on the server type, like the [FastMCP Server (`FastMCP`)](02_fastmcp_server___fastmcp__.md) we'll see next.
131: 
132: Here's a simplified diagram of that flow:

151:     ServerCode->>ServerCode: Start listening/processing...
152: ```
153: 
154: ## Diving into the Code (Briefly!)
155: 
156: You don't need to memorize this, but seeing snippets can help understand the structure.
157: 
158: **Inside `cli/cli.py` (Simplified):**
159: 
160: ```python
161: # Import the Typer library for creating CLIs
162: import typer
163: # Import helpers to find/load the server code
164: from .helpers import _parse_file_path, _import_server # Fictional helper import
165: 
166: # Create the main CLI application object
167: app = typer.Typer(name="mcp", help="MCP development tools")
168: 
169: # Decorator tells Typer this function handles the 'run' command
170: @app.command()
171: def run(
172:     file_spec: str = typer.Argument(...), # Expects the file path argument
173:     # ... other options like --transport ...
174: ) -> None:
175:     """Run a MCP server."""
176:     # 1. Find the file and specific server object (if any)
177:     file_path, server_object_name = _parse_file_path(file_spec)
178: 
179:     # 2. Load the code and get the server instance
180:     server = _import_server(file_path, server_object_name)
181: 
182:     # 3. Tell the server instance to start running
183:     server.run() # Additional args like transport might be passed here
184: 
185: # ... other commands like dev, install, version defined similarly ...
186: 
187: # Standard Python entry point
188: if __name__ == "__main__":
189:     app() # Start the Typer application
190: ```
191: 
192: This shows how `Typer` connects your command (`mcp run`) to the `run` function, which then orchestrates finding and starting your server code.
193: 
194: **Inside `cli/claude.py` (Simplified `update_claude_config`):**
195: 
196: ```python
197: import json
198: from pathlib import Path
199: 
200: # Helper to find where Claude stores its config
201: def get_claude_config_path() -> Path | None:
202:     # ... platform specific logic to find the path ...
203:     # Returns Path object like /Users/You/Library/Application Support/Claude
204:     pass # Implementation details skipped
205: 
206: def update_claude_config(file_spec: str, server_name: str, ...) -> bool:
207:     """Add or update a FastMCP server in Claude's configuration."""
208:     config_dir = get_claude_config_path()
209:     if not config_dir:
210:         print("Error: Claude config not found.")
211:         return False
212: 
213:     config_file = config_dir / "claude_desktop_config.json"
214: 
215:     try:
216:         # Read existing config or create an empty one
217:         config = json.loads(config_file.read_text()) if config_file.exists() else {}
218:         if "mcpServers" not in config:
219:             config["mcpServers"] = {}
220: 
221:         # Define how to run the server using 'uv' (a tool for running Python code)
222:         # This builds the command: uv run --with mcp mcp run /path/to/server.py
223:         run_command = ["uv", "run", "--with", "mcp", "mcp", "run", file_spec]
224:         # ... logic to add --with-editable or --with packages ...
225: 
226:         # Add the server entry to the config dictionary
227:         config["mcpServers"][server_name] = {
228:             "command": "uv",
229:             "args": run_command[1:], # Arguments for the uv command
230:             # ... potentially add 'env' dictionary here ...
231:         }
232: 
233:         # Write the updated configuration back to the file
234:         config_file.write_text(json.dumps(config, indent=2))
235:         print(f"Successfully installed {server_name} in Claude.")
236:         return True
237:     except Exception as e:
238:         print(f"Error updating Claude config: {e}")
239:         return False
240: ```
241: 
242: This snippet shows the core logic of `mcp install`: find the Claude config file, construct the command needed to run *your* server using `uv` and `mcp run`, and save this information into the JSON configuration file.
243: 
244: ## Conclusion
245: 
246: You've learned about the `mcp` command-line interface – your essential toolkit for managing MCP servers. You now know how to:
247: 
248: *   Check your installation with `mcp version`.
249: *   Run a server directly using `mcp run your_server.py`.
250: *   Run a server with a debugging inspector using `mcp dev your_server.py`.
251: *   Register your server with applications like Claude Desktop using `mcp install your_server.py`.
252: 
253: This command is your bridge between writing server code and actually using it.
254: 
255: In the next chapter, we'll dive into the heart of many MCP servers: the [FastMCP Server (`FastMCP`)](02_fastmcp_server___fastmcp__.md), which is the kind of object the `mcp` command typically runs.

  8: # Chapter 2: Easier Server Building with `FastMCP`
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: Your Control Panel - The `mcp` Command-Line Interface](01_cli___mcp__command_.md), we learned how to use the `mcp` command to run, test, and install MCP servers. We even saw a tiny example of a server file. But how do we *build* that server code without getting lost in complex details?
 11: 
 12: Imagine you want to build a simple AI assistant that can just echo back whatever you type. Writing all the code to handle connections, interpret messages according to the MCP protocol, manage capabilities – it sounds like a lot of work just for an echo!
 13: 
 14: This is where `FastMCP` comes in. It's designed to make building MCP servers much, much easier.
 15: 
 16: ## What is `FastMCP`?
 17: 
 18: Think of the low-level parts of the MCP protocol like individual kitchen tools: a pot, a pan, a knife, a whisk. You *could* use them all individually to cook a meal, but you'd need to know exactly when and how to use each one.
 19: 
 20: `FastMCP` is like a fancy **kitchen multi-cooker**. It bundles many common functions together in an easy-to-use package. You provide the ingredients (your Python functions and data) and press simple buttons (special markers called **decorators** like `@tool`, `@resource`, `@prompt`), and `FastMCP` handles the complex cooking process (managing the low-level MCP details) for you.
 21: 
 22: **Key benefits of using `FastMCP`:**
 23: 
 24: *   **Simplicity:** Hides a lot of the complex MCP protocol details.
 25: *   **Developer-Friendly:** Uses familiar Python concepts like functions and decorators.
 26: *   **Less Boilerplate:** Reduces the amount of repetitive setup code you need to write.
 27: *   **Built-in Features:** Includes easy ways to manage settings, automatically tell clients what your server can do (capability generation), and handle common tasks.
 28: 
 29: ## Your First `FastMCP` Server: The Foundation
 30: 
 31: Let's start with the absolute minimum needed to create a `FastMCP` server.
 32: 
 33: **File: `my_simple_server.py`**
 34: 
 35: ```python
 36: # 1. Import the FastMCP class
 37: from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
 38: 
 39: # 2. Create an instance of the FastMCP server
 40: #    Give it a name clients might see.
 41: #    Optionally, provide general instructions.
 42: server = FastMCP(
 43:     name="MySimpleServer",
 44:     instructions="This is a very simple example server."
 45: )
 46: 
 47: # 3. Add the standard Python block to run the server
 48: #    when the script is executed directly.
 49: if __name__ == "__main__":
 50:     print(f"Starting {server.name}...")
 51:     # This tells FastMCP to start listening for connections
 52:     server.run()
 53:     print(f"{server.name} finished.") # Usually only seen after stopping (Ctrl+C)
 54: ```
 55: 
 56: **Explanation:**
 57: 
 58: 1.  **`from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP`**: We import the main `FastMCP` class from the SDK.
 59: 2.  **`server = FastMCP(...)`**: We create our "multi-cooker" object.
 60:     *   `name="MySimpleServer"`: This is a human-readable name for your server. Clients might display this name.
 61:     *   `instructions="..."`: This provides a general description or purpose for the server. Clients can use this to understand what the server does.
 62: 3.  **`if __name__ == "__main__":`**: This is a standard Python pattern. The code inside this block only runs when you execute the script directly (e.g., using `python my_simple_server.py` or `mcp run my_simple_server.py`).
 63: 4.  **`server.run()`**: This is the command that actually starts the server. It tells `FastMCP` to begin listening for incoming connections and handling MCP messages. By default, it uses the "stdio" transport (reading/writing from the terminal), which we discussed briefly in Chapter 1.
 64: 
 65: If you save this code as `my_simple_server.py` and run it using `mcp run my_simple_server.py` (as learned in Chapter 1), it will start! It won't *do* much yet, because we haven't added any specific capabilities, but it's a functioning MCP server.
 66: 
 67: ## Adding Features with Decorators: The "Buttons"
 68: 
 69: Our multi-cooker (`FastMCP`) is running, but it doesn't have any cooking programs yet. How do we add features, like our "echo" tool? We use **decorators**.
 70: 
 71: Decorators in Python are special markers starting with `@` that you place above a function definition. They modify or enhance the function in some way. `FastMCP` uses decorators like `@server.tool()`, `@server.resource()`, and `@server.prompt()` to easily register your Python functions as capabilities that clients can use.
 72: 
 73: Let's add an "echo" tool using the `@server.tool()` decorator.
 74: 
 75: **File: `echo_server.py` (Simpler Version)**
 76: 
 77: ```python
 78: from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
 79: 
 80: # 1. Create the server instance
 81: server = FastMCP(name="EchoServer")
 82: 
 83: # 2. Define the tool using the @server.tool decorator
 84: @server.tool(name="echo", description="Repeats the input message back.")
 85: def echo(message: str) -> str:
 86:   """
 87:   This function is now registered as the 'echo' tool.
 88:   'message: str' tells FastMCP the tool expects one argument
 89:   named 'message' which should be a string.
 90:   '-> str' tells FastMCP the tool will return a string.
 91:   """
 92:   print(f"Tool 'echo' called with message: {message}") # Server-side log
 93:   # 3. The function's logic directly implements the tool
 94:   return f"You said: {message}"
 95: 
 96: # 4. Standard run block
 97: if __name__ == "__main__":
 98:     print(f"Starting {server.name}...")
 99:     server.run() # Start listening
100:     print(f"{server.name} finished.")
101: ```
102: 
103: **Explanation:**
104: 
105: 1.  **`server = FastMCP(...)`**: Same as before, creates our server object.
106: 2.  **`@server.tool(...)`**: This is the magic!
107:     *   We use the `@tool()` method of our `server` object as a decorator.
108:     *   `name="echo"`: We explicitly tell `FastMCP` that this tool should be called `echo` by clients. If we omitted this, it would default to the function name (`echo`).
109:     *   `description="..."`: A helpful description for clients.
110: 3.  **`def echo(message: str) -> str:`**: This is a standard Python function.
111:     *   `message: str`: This is a **type hint**. It tells `FastMCP` (and other tools) that this function expects one argument named `message`, and that argument should be a string. `FastMCP` uses this information to automatically validate input from clients and generate documentation.
112:     *   `-> str`: This type hint indicates that the function will return a string. `FastMCP` uses this to know what kind of output to expect.
113:     *   The function body contains the logic for our tool.
114: 4.  **`server.run()`**: Starts the server, which now knows about the `echo` tool thanks to the decorator.
115: 
116: Now, if you run `mcp run echo_server.py`, the server will start and will be capable of responding to requests for the `echo` tool! A client could send a "callTool" request with the name "echo" and an argument `{"message": "Hello!"}`, and `FastMCP` would automatically run your `echo` function and send back the result `"You said: Hello!"`.
117: 
118: We'll explore `@server.resource()` and `@server.prompt()` in later chapters:
119: *   [Chapter 3: FastMCP Resources (`Resource`, `ResourceManager`)](03_fastmcp_resources___resource____resourcemanager__.md)
120: *   [Chapter 5: FastMCP Prompts (`Prompt`, `PromptManager`)](05_fastmcp_prompts___prompt____promptmanager__.md)
121: 
122: ## How `FastMCP` Works Under the Hood (Simplified)
123: 
124: It feels simple to use, but what's `FastMCP` actually doing?
125: 
126: 1.  **Initialization:** When you create `FastMCP()`, it sets up internal managers for tools, resources, and prompts (like `_tool_manager`, `_resource_manager`, `_prompt_manager`).
127: 2.  **Registration:** When Python encounters `@server.tool(...)` above your `echo` function, it calls the `server.tool()` method. This method takes your `echo` function and its details (name, description, parameter types from hints) and registers it with the internal `_tool_manager`.
128: 3.  **Running:** When you call `server.run()`, `FastMCP` starts the underlying low-level MCP server machinery. This machinery listens for incoming connections (e.g., via stdio or web protocols).
129: 4.  **Handling Requests:** When a client connects and sends an MCP message like `{"method": "callTool", "params": {"name": "echo", "arguments": {"message": "Test"}}}`:
130:     *   The low-level server receives the raw message.
131:     *   `FastMCP`'s core logic takes over. It sees it's a `callTool` request for the tool named `echo`.
132:     *   It asks its `_tool_manager` if it knows about a tool named `echo`.
133:     *   The `_tool_manager` finds the registered `echo` function.
134:     *   `FastMCP` extracts the `arguments` (`{"message": "Test"}`) from the request.
135:     *   It validates these arguments against the function's signature (`message: str`).
136:     *   It calls your actual Python `echo` function, passing `"Test"` as the `message` argument.
137:     *   Your function runs and returns `"You said: Test"`.
138:     *   `FastMCP` takes this return value, packages it into a valid MCP `callTool` response message, and sends it back to the client via the low-level machinery.

156: 
157: **Looking at the Code (Briefly):**
158: 
159: You don't need to understand every line, but seeing where things happen can be helpful.
160: 
161: **Inside `server/fastmcp/server.py` (Simplified `FastMCP.__init__`):**
162: 
163: ```python
164: # (...) imports (...)
165: from .tools import ToolManager
166: from .resources import ResourceManager
167: from .prompts import PromptManager
168: 
169: class FastMCP:
170:     def __init__(
171:         self, name: str | None = None, instructions: str | None = None, **settings: Any
172:     ):
173:         # Stores settings like debug mode, log level etc.
174:         self.settings = Settings(**settings)
175: 
176:         # Creates the underlying low-level MCP server
177:         self._mcp_server = MCPServer(
178:             name=name or "FastMCP",
179:             instructions=instructions,
180:             # ... other low-level setup ...
181:         )
182:         # Creates the managers to keep track of registered items
183:         self._tool_manager = ToolManager(
184:             warn_on_duplicate_tools=self.settings.warn_on_duplicate_tools
185:         )
186:         self._resource_manager = ResourceManager(
187:             # ...
188:         )
189:         self._prompt_manager = PromptManager(
190:             # ...
191:         )
192: 
193:         # Connects MCP requests (like 'callTool') to FastMCP methods
194:         self._setup_handlers()
195:         # (...)
196: ```
197: 
198: This shows that `FastMCP` creates helper objects (`_tool_manager`, etc.) to organize the tools, resources, and prompts you register.
199: 
200: **Inside `server/fastmcp/server.py` (Simplified `FastMCP.tool` decorator):**
201: 
202: ```python
203: # (...) imports (...)
204: from mcp.types import AnyFunction # Represents any kind of Python function
205: 
206: class FastMCP:

232:         # This passes the function and its info to the ToolManager
233:         self._tool_manager.add_tool(fn, name=name, description=description)
234: 
235: ```
236: 
237: This shows how the `@server.tool()` decorator ultimately calls `self._tool_manager.add_tool()` to register your function.
238: 
239: **Inside `server/fastmcp/server.py` (Simplified `FastMCP.call_tool` handler):**
240:

257:         # Converts the function's return value (e.g., "You said: Test")
258:         # into the format MCP expects for the response.
259:         converted_result = _convert_to_content(result)
260:         return converted_result
261: 
262:     def _setup_handlers(self) -> None:
263:         """Set up core MCP protocol handlers."""
264:         # This line connects the low-level 'callTool' message

266:         self._mcp_server.call_tool()(self.call_tool)
267:         # (...) other handlers for listTools, readResource etc. (...)
268: ```
269: 
270: This shows how an incoming `callTool` message gets routed to the `call_tool` method, which then uses the `_tool_manager` to run your registered function.
271: 
272: ## Conclusion
273: 
274: You've now seen how `FastMCP` provides a much simpler way to build MCP servers compared to handling the low-level protocol directly. Like a multi-cooker, it offers convenient "buttons" (decorators like `@server.tool()`) to add features (like tools) to your server using standard Python functions. It handles the underlying complexity of receiving requests, calling your code, and sending responses.
275: 
276: You learned how to:
277: *   Create a basic `FastMCP` server instance.
278: *   Define a Python function that performs a task.
279: *   Use the `@server.tool()` decorator to register that function as a tool clients can call.
280: *   Understand the basic flow of how `FastMCP` handles a tool call request using its internal managers.
281: 
282: While our `echo` tool was simple, `FastMCP` provides the foundation for building much more complex and powerful AI agents and tools.
283: 
284: In the next chapters, we'll explore the other "buttons" on our multi-cooker, starting with how to provide data and files using `@server.resource()` in [Chapter 3: FastMCP Resources (`Resource`, `ResourceManager`)](03_fastmcp_resources___resource____resourcemanager__.md).

  8: # Chapter 3: Sharing Data - FastMCP Resources (`Resource`, `ResourceManager`)
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 2: Easier Server Building with `FastMCP`](02_fastmcp_server___fastmcp__.md), we saw how `FastMCP` and the `@server.tool()` decorator make it easy to create servers that can *perform actions* for clients, like our `echo` tool.
 11: 
 12: But what if your server just needs to share some *data*? Maybe it has a configuration file the client needs, a list of available items, or some text generated on the fly. You *could* make a tool for each piece of data, but that feels clunky. Isn't there a way for clients to just browse and read data sources directly?
 13: 
 14: Yes, there is! Welcome to **FastMCP Resources**.
 15: 
 16: ## The Digital Library: Resources and the Resource Manager
 17: 
 18: Imagine your `FastMCP` server is like a **digital library**. Inside this library, you have various pieces of information:
 19: *   Simple text notes (like a welcome message).
 20: *   Static files (like a configuration file or a small image).
 21: *   Information that changes (like the current time or weather).
 22: 
 23: Each piece of information in this library is called a **`Resource`**. Think of each `Resource` as a book, a document, or maybe even a live news feed within the library.
 24: 
 25: To access any item in a library, you need its unique identifier – like a call number or an ISBN. In FastMCP, resources are identified by a **URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier). This looks similar to a web URL (like `http://example.com`) but can use different schemes (like `data://`, `file://`, `weather://`). For example, a welcome message might have the URI `data://welcome_message`.
 26: 
 27: Now, how do you find out what books are in the library, or add a new one? You talk to the **librarian**. In `FastMCP`, the component that keeps track of all the available resources is called the **`ResourceManager`**.
 28: 
 29: *   **`Resource`**: A specific piece of data (static, dynamic, file) accessible via a URI. (The book)
 30: *   **`ResourceManager`**: Manages all the `Resource` objects registered with the `FastMCP` server. (The librarian)
 31: *   **URI**: The unique address used to find and access a `Resource`. (The call number)
 32: 
 33: Clients can ask the `ResourceManager` (via `FastMCP`) to list all available resources (`listResources`) and then request the content of a specific resource using its URI (`readResource`).
 34: 
 35: ## Adding Books to the Library: Using `@server.resource()`
 36: 
 37: Just like `@server.tool()` made it easy to add actions, `FastMCP` provides a simple decorator, `@server.resource()`, to add data resources to your server's library (its `ResourceManager`).
 38: 
 39: Let's add a simple, static welcome message to our server.
 40: 
 41: **File: `library_server.py` (Version 1)**
 42: 
 43: ```python
 44: # 1. Import FastMCP
 45: from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
 46: 
 47: # 2. Create the server instance
 48: server = FastMCP(name="LibraryServer")
 49: 
 50: # 3. Define a function that returns our static data
 51: def get_welcome_message() -> str:
 52:   """Returns a simple welcome string."""
 53:   return "Welcome to the Library Server!"
 54: 
 55: # 4. Use the @server.resource() decorator to register the function's result
 56: #    The URI "data://greeting" will be used by clients to access this.
 57: @server.resource(uri="data://greeting", description="A friendly greeting.")
 58: def welcome_resource():
 59:     # This function will be called *when a client reads* the resource.
 60:     # It just returns the static message.
 61:     return get_welcome_message() # Or simply: return "Welcome..."
 62: 
 63: # Standard run block
 64: if __name__ == "__main__":
 65:     print(f"Starting {server.name}...")
 66:     server.run()
 67:     print(f"{server.name} finished.")
 68: ```
 69: 
 70: *(Self-correction: The previous example was slightly complex with two functions. Let's simplify.)*
 71: 
 72: **File: `library_server.py` (Version 1 - Simpler)**
 73: 
 74: ```python
 75: # 1. Import FastMCP
 76: from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
 77: 
 78: # 2. Create the server instance
 79: server = FastMCP(name="LibraryServer")
 80: 
 81: # 3. Use the @server.resource() decorator directly on the function
 82: #    that provides the data.
 83: @server.resource(uri="data://greeting", description="A friendly greeting.")
 84: def welcome_message() -> str:
 85:   """
 86:   This function is registered as the resource 'data://greeting'.
 87:   It will be called when a client reads this resource URI.
 88:   '-> str' indicates it returns text. FastMCP sets MIME type to text/plain.
 89:   """
 90:   print("Resource 'data://greeting' was read!") # Server-side log
 91:   return "Welcome to the Library Server! Enjoy your stay."
 92: 
 93: # 4. Standard run block
 94: if __name__ == "__main__":
 95:     print(f"Starting {server.name}...")
 96:     server.run() # Start listening
 97:     print(f"{server.name} finished.")
 98: ```
 99: 
100: **Explanation:**
101: 
102: 1.  **`server = FastMCP(...)`**: Creates our server (the library). Inside, it creates a `ResourceManager` (the librarian).
103: 2.  **`@server.resource(...)`**: This is our decorator "button".
104:     *   `uri="data://greeting"`: We assign a unique URI (call number) to this resource. The `data://` part is just a convention here, you can choose meaningful schemes.
105:     *   `description="..."`: A helpful description for clients browsing the library.
106: 3.  **`def welcome_message() -> str:`**: This function provides the *content* for the resource.
107:     *   `-> str`: The type hint tells `FastMCP` this resource provides text data. It will automatically set the `mime_type` to `text/plain`.
108:     *   The function's body simply returns the string we want to share.
109:     *   **Important:** This function is only executed when a client actually asks to *read* the resource `data://greeting`. It's not run when the server starts.
110: 4.  **`server.run()`**: Starts the server. The `ResourceManager` now knows about `data://greeting`.
111: 
112: If you run this server (`mcp run library_server.py`), a client could:
113: 1.  Call `listResources` and see `data://greeting` in the list.
114: 2.  Call `readResource` with the URI `data://greeting`.
115: 3.  `FastMCP` would ask the `ResourceManager`, find the registered function (`welcome_message`), run it, get the string `"Welcome..."`, and send it back to the client.
116: 
117: ## Dynamic Data: Resources Generated on the Fly
118: 
119: Resources don't have to be static text. The function you decorate can do calculations, read files, or anything else to generate the data *when it's requested*. This is great for information that changes.
120: 
121: Let's add a resource that tells the current time.
122: 
123: **File: `library_server.py` (Version 2)**
124: 
125: ```python
126: import datetime # Need this module to get the current time
127: from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
128: 
129: server = FastMCP(name="LibraryServer")
130: 
131: @server.resource(uri="data://greeting", description="A friendly greeting.")
132: def welcome_message() -> str:
133:   print("Resource 'data://greeting' was read!")
134:   return "Welcome to the Library Server! Enjoy your stay."
135: 
136: # NEW: Add a dynamic resource for the current time
137: @server.resource(uri="time://current", description="The current server time.")
138: def current_time() -> str:
139:   """Returns the current time as a string."""
140:   now = datetime.datetime.now()
141:   time_str = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
142:   print(f"Resource 'time://current' was read! Time is {time_str}")
143:   # The function calculates the time *each time* it's called
144:   return f"The current server time is: {time_str}"
145: 
146: # Standard run block
147: if __name__ == "__main__":
148:     print(f"Starting {server.name}...")
149:     server.run()
150:     print(f"{server.name} finished.")
151: ```
152: 
153: Now, every time a client reads `time://current`, the `current_time` function will execute, get the *latest* time, format it, and return it.
154: 
155: ## Parameterized Data: Resource Templates
156: 
157: What if you have data related to specific items, like weather information for different cities? You wouldn't want to create a separate resource function for every city (`weather_london`, `weather_paris`, etc.).
158: 
159: Resource URIs can contain parameters, indicated by curly braces `{}`. When you define a resource with a parameterized URI and a function that accepts arguments matching those parameters, `FastMCP` creates a **Resource Template**.
160: 
161: **File: `library_server.py` (Version 3)**
162: 
163: ```python
164: import datetime
165: import random # To simulate getting weather data
166: from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
167: 
168: server = FastMCP(name="LibraryServer")
169: 
170: @server.resource(uri="data://greeting", description="A friendly greeting.")
171: def welcome_message() -> str:
172:     return "Welcome to the Library Server! Enjoy your stay."
173: 
174: @server.resource(uri="time://current", description="The current server time.")
175: def current_time() -> str:
176:     now = datetime.datetime.now()
177:     return f"The current server time is: {now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}"
178: 
179: # NEW: Add a resource template for weather
180: # The URI contains a parameter {city_name}
181: @server.resource(uri="weather://forecast/{city_name}",
182:                   description="Provides a dummy weather forecast.")
183: # The function accepts an argument matching the URI parameter
184: def get_weather_forecast(city_name: str) -> str:
185:     """Generates a fake weather forecast for the given city."""
186:     print(f"Resource template 'weather://forecast/{{city}}' read for city: {city_name}")
187:     # In a real app, you'd fetch actual weather here based on city_name
188:     temperature = random.randint(5, 25)
189:     conditions = random.choice(["Sunny", "Cloudy", "Rainy"])
190:     return f"Forecast for {city_name.capitalize()}: {temperature}°C, {conditions}"
191: 
192: # Standard run block
193: if __name__ == "__main__":
194:     print(f"Starting {server.name}...")
195:     server.run()
196:     print(f"{server.name} finished.")
197: ```
198: 
199: **Explanation:**
200: 
201: 1.  **`@server.resource(uri="weather://forecast/{city_name}", ...)`**: We define a URI with a placeholder `{city_name}`.
202: 2.  **`def get_weather_forecast(city_name: str) -> str:`**: The function signature includes a parameter `city_name` that exactly matches the name inside the curly braces in the URI.
203: 3.  **How it works:**
204:     *   When a client asks to read a URI like `weather://forecast/london`, `FastMCP` sees it matches the template.
205:     *   It extracts the value "london" from the URI.
206:     *   It calls the `get_weather_forecast` function, passing `"london"` as the `city_name` argument.
207:     *   The function generates the forecast for London and returns the string.
208:     *   If the client asks for `weather://forecast/paris`, the same function is called, but with `city_name="paris"`.
209: 
210: This template approach is very powerful for providing structured data without writing repetitive code. Clients would use `listResourceTemplates` to discover templates like this.
211: 
212: ## How Resources Work Under the Hood
213: 
214: Using `@server.resource()` feels simple, but what's happening inside `FastMCP`?
215: 
216: 1.  **Registration:** When Python processes your code and sees `@server.resource(uri="data://greeting")` above the `welcome_message` function, it calls an internal `server.resource()` method.
217:     *   This method analyzes the URI and the function.
218:     *   If the URI has no `{}` parameters and the function takes no arguments (or only a `Context` argument), it creates a `FunctionResource` object. This object essentially wraps your `welcome_message` function, storing its details (URI, description, the function itself).
219:     *   If the URI *does* have parameters matching the function's arguments (like `weather://forecast/{city_name}` and `get_weather_forecast(city_name: str)`), it creates a `ResourceTemplate` object instead.
220:     *   It then tells the `ResourceManager` (the librarian) to store this `FunctionResource` or `ResourceTemplate`. (This happens via `_resource_manager.add_resource` or `_resource_manager.add_template`, referencing `server/fastmcp/resources/resource_manager.py`).
221: 
222: 2.  **Client Request (`readResource`)**:
223:     *   A client sends an MCP message: `{"method": "readResource", "params": {"uri": "data://greeting"}}`.
224:     *   `FastMCP` receives this and calls its internal `read_resource` handler (see `server/fastmcp/server.py`).
225:     *   The handler asks the `ResourceManager`: "Do you have a resource for the URI `data://greeting`?" (`_resource_manager.get_resource`).
226:     *   The `ResourceManager` checks its list of concrete resources. It finds the `FunctionResource` associated with `data://greeting`.
227:     *   `FastMCP` (or the `ResourceManager`) calls the `.read()` method on that `FunctionResource` object (see `server/fastmcp/resources/types.py`).
228:     *   The `FunctionResource.read()` method executes the original Python function you decorated (`welcome_message()`).
229:     *   Your function returns the string `"Welcome..."`.
230:     *   `FastMCP` packages this string into a valid MCP `readResource` response and sends it back to the client.
231: 
232: 3.  **Client Request (`readResource` with Template)**:
233:     *   Client sends: `{"method": "readResource", "params": {"uri": "weather://forecast/london"}}`.
234:     *   `FastMCP` asks `ResourceManager` for `weather://forecast/london`.
235:     *   `ResourceManager` checks concrete resources – no match.
236:     *   `ResourceManager` checks its `ResourceTemplate` list. It finds the `weather://forecast/{city_name}` template matches the requested URI.
237:     *   It extracts the parameter `{"city_name": "london"}`.
238:     *   It uses the template to *dynamically create* a temporary `FunctionResource` for this specific request, configured to call `get_weather_forecast(city_name="london")`.
239:     *   `FastMCP` calls `.read()` on this temporary resource.
240:     *   The `get_weather_forecast("london")` function runs and returns the forecast string.
241:     *   `FastMCP` sends the result back.
242: 
243: **Simplified Sequence Diagram (`readResource` for `data://greeting`):**
244: 
245: ```mermaid
246: sequenceDiagram
247:     participant Client
248:     participant FastMCP_Server as FastMCP (library_server.py)
249:     participant ResManager as ResourceManager (_resource_manager)
250:     participant FuncResource as FunctionResource (wraps welcome_message)
251:     participant WelcomeFunc as welcome_message()
252: 
253:     Client->>+FastMCP_Server: Send MCP Request: readResource(uri="data://greeting")
254:     FastMCP_Server->>+ResManager: get_resource("data://greeting")
255:     ResManager-->>-FastMCP_Server: Return FunctionResource object
256:     FastMCP_Server->>+FuncResource: resource.read()
257:     FuncResource->>+WelcomeFunc: Call original function welcome_message()
258:     WelcomeFunc-->>-FuncResource: Return "Welcome..."
259:     FuncResource-->>-FastMCP_Server: Return "Welcome..."
260:     FastMCP_Server->>-Client: Send MCP Response: content="Welcome..."
261: ```
262: 
263: While `@server.resource()` is the easiest way, the SDK also provides classes like `TextResource`, `BinaryResource`, `FileResource` (see `server/fastmcp/resources/types.py`) that you could potentially instantiate and add directly using `server.add_resource(MyTextResource(...))`, but the decorator handles wrapping your functions nicely.
264: 
265: ## Conclusion
266: 
267: You've learned about FastMCP Resources – the way to share data from your server like items in a digital library.
268: 
269: *   **Resources (`Resource`)** are data sources (text, files, dynamic content) identified by **URIs**.
270: *   The **`ResourceManager`** keeps track of all registered resources.
271: *   The `@server.resource()` decorator is the easiest way to add resources by wrapping Python functions.
272: *   Resources can be **static** (returning the same data) or **dynamic** (generating data when read).
273: *   **Resource Templates** allow you to handle parameterized URIs (like `weather://forecast/{city}`) efficiently.
274: *   Clients use `listResources`, `listResourceTemplates`, and `readResource` to interact with your server's data library.
275: 
276: Resources are essential for providing context, configuration, or any other data your clients might need to consume without executing a complex action.
277: 
278: In the next chapter, we'll take a closer look at the other main building block we briefly saw in Chapter 2: [FastMCP Tools (`Tool`, `ToolManager`)](04_fastmcp_tools___tool____toolmanager__.md), and explore how they handle actions and inputs in more detail.

  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 3: Sharing Data - FastMCP Resources (`Resource`, `ResourceManager`)](03_fastmcp_resources___resource____resourcemanager__.md), we learned how to make data available for clients to read using `Resource` objects, like putting books in a digital library. That's great for sharing information, but what if we want the client to be able to ask the server to *do* something?
 11: 
 12: Imagine you want your server to not just provide data, but to perform calculations, interact with a database, or control some hardware. For example, maybe you want a client application (like an AI assistant) to be able to ask your server, "What's 5 plus 7?". The server needs to perform the addition and send back the result.
 13: 
 14: This is where **FastMCP Tools** come in. They allow your server to expose functions that clients can call remotely.
 15: 
 16: ## The Workshop Analogy: Tools and the Foreman
 17: 
 18: Think of your `FastMCP` server as a well-equipped workshop. Inside this workshop, you have various specialized tools:
 19: *   A drill (`Tool`)
 20: *   A screwdriver (`Tool`)
 21: *   A calculator (`Tool`)
 22: 
 23: Each **`Tool`** is designed for a specific job. When someone (a client) needs a job done, they don't operate the tool directly. Instead, they go to the workshop **foreman** (the **`ToolManager`**) and say:
 24: 
 25: "I need to use the `calculator` tool. Please add these numbers: `5` and `7`."
 26: 
 27: The foreman (`ToolManager`) knows exactly where the `calculator` tool is and how it works. It takes the request, operates the calculator with the provided numbers (`5`, `7`), gets the result (`12`), and gives it back to the person who asked.
 28: 
 29: *   **`Tool`**: A specific function or capability your server offers (like the calculator). It has a name and accepts specific inputs (arguments).
 30: *   **`ToolManager`**: The internal manager within `FastMCP` that keeps track of all available `Tool` objects and handles requests to use them (the foreman). Clients interact with the `ToolManager` via `FastMCP`.
 31: 
 32: Clients can ask the `ToolManager` (via `FastMCP`) to list all available tools (`listTools`) and then request to execute a specific tool by its name, providing the necessary arguments (`callTool`).
 33: 
 34: ## Adding Tools to Your Workshop: Using `@server.tool()`
 35: 
 36: Just like we used `@server.resource()` to add data "books" to our library, `FastMCP` provides the `@server.tool()` decorator to easily add action "tools" to our workshop (managed by the `ToolManager`).
 37: 
 38: Let's create a simple server with a calculator tool that can add two numbers.
 39: 
 40: **File: `calculator_server.py`**
 41: 
 42: ```python
 43: # 1. Import FastMCP
 44: from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
 45: 
 46: # 2. Create the server instance
 47: server = FastMCP(name="CalculatorServer")
 48: 
 49: # 3. Use the @server.tool() decorator to define our tool
 50: @server.tool(name="add", description="Adds two numbers together.")
 51: def add_numbers(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
 52:   """
 53:   This function is registered as the 'add' tool.
 54:   'num1: int' and 'num2: int' tell FastMCP the tool expects
 55:   two integer arguments named 'num1' and 'num2'.
 56:   '-> int' tells FastMCP the tool will return an integer.
 57:   """
 58:   print(f"Tool 'add' called with {num1} and {num2}") # Server-side log
 59:   # 4. The function's logic performs the action
 60:   result = num1 + num2
 61:   print(f"Returning result: {result}")
 62:   return result
 63: 
 64: # 5. Standard run block
 65: if __name__ == "__main__":
 66:     print(f"Starting {server.name}...")
 67:     server.run() # Start listening
 68:     print(f"{server.name} finished.")
 69: ```
 70: 
 71: **Explanation:**
 72: 
 73: 1.  **`server = FastMCP(...)`**: Creates our server (the workshop). Internally, this also creates a `ToolManager` (the foreman).
 74: 2.  **`@server.tool(...)`**: This is our decorator "button" for adding tools.
 75:     *   We use the `.tool()` method of our `server` object as a decorator.
 76:     *   `name="add"`: We tell `FastMCP` that clients should use the name `add` to call this tool.
 77:     *   `description="..."`: A helpful description for clients.
 78: 3.  **`def add_numbers(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:`**: This is a standard Python function.
 79:     *   `num1: int`, `num2: int`: These **type hints** are crucial! They tell `FastMCP` what arguments the tool expects (two integers named `num1` and `num2`). `FastMCP` uses this to validate input from clients and to generate documentation about the tool.
 80:     *   `-> int`: This type hint indicates that the function will return an integer result.
 81: 4.  **Function Body**: This contains the actual logic for our tool – adding the numbers.
 82: 5.  **`server.run()`**: Starts the server. The `ToolManager` now knows about the `add` tool.
 83: 
 84: If you run this server (`mcp run calculator_server.py`), a client could:
 85: 1.  Call `listTools` and see the `add` tool listed, along with its description and expected arguments (`num1` (int), `num2` (int)).
 86: 2.  Call `callTool` with the name `add` and arguments like `{"num1": 5, "num2": 7}`.
 87: 3.  `FastMCP` would ask the `ToolManager` to execute the `add` tool. The `ToolManager` would find your `add_numbers` function, check that the arguments match (`5` and `7` are integers), call the function, get the integer result `12`, and send it back to the client.
 88: 
 89: ## How Clients Use Tools
 90: 
 91: You don't need to worry about writing client code right now, but it's helpful to understand the basic interaction:
 92: 
 93: 1.  **Discovery:** The client first asks the server, "What tools do you have?" (using the MCP `listTools` method). The server, guided by its `ToolManager`, responds with a list of tools, including their names, descriptions, and what arguments they expect (based on your Python function signature and the `@server.tool` decorator).
 94: 2.  **Invocation:** The client then decides to use a specific tool. It sends a request like, "Please execute the tool named 'add' with these arguments: `num1` is `5`, `num2` is `7`." (using the MCP `callTool` method).
 95: 3.  **Execution & Response:** The server receives this request. `FastMCP` hands it off to the `ToolManager`. The `ToolManager` finds the correct Python function (`add_numbers`), validates and passes the arguments (`5`, `7`), executes the function, gets the return value (`12`), and sends this result back to the client.
 96: 
 97: ## The Foreman: `ToolManager` Behind the Scenes
 98: 
 99: While you primarily interact with `@server.tool()`, the `ToolManager` is the component within `FastMCP` that does the heavy lifting for tools.
100: 
101: When `FastMCP` starts, it creates a `ToolManager` instance. Every time you use the `@server.tool()` decorator, you're essentially telling `FastMCP` to register that function with its `ToolManager`.
102: 
103: The `ToolManager`:
104: *   Keeps a dictionary mapping tool names (like `"add"`) to the corresponding `Tool` objects (which contain information about your function, its parameters, etc.).
105: *   Provides the list of tools when `FastMCP` needs to respond to a `listTools` request.
106: *   Looks up the correct `Tool` object when `FastMCP` receives a `callTool` request.
107: *   Validates the arguments provided by the client against the tool's expected parameters (using the information gathered from type hints).
108: *   Calls your actual Python function with the validated arguments.
109: *   Handles potential errors during tool execution.
110: 
111: You usually don't need to interact with `ToolManager` directly; `@server.tool()` is the convenient interface.
112: 
113: ## How Tools Work Under the Hood
114: 
115: Let's trace the journey of our `add` tool from definition to execution.
116: 
117: **1. Registration (When the server code loads):**
118: 
119: *   Python executes your `calculator_server.py`.
120: *   It reaches the `@server.tool(name="add", ...)` line above `def add_numbers(...)`.
121: *   This calls the `server.tool()` method. Inside `FastMCP`, this ultimately calls `_tool_manager.add_tool()`.
122: *   The `ToolManager.add_tool` method inspects the `add_numbers` function:
123:     *   Gets its name (`add_numbers`, but overridden by `name="add"`).
124:     *   Gets its description (from the decorator or docstring).
125:     *   Looks at the parameters (`num1: int`, `num2: int`) and return type (`-> int`) using Python's introspection features.
126:     *   Uses this information to build a schema describing the expected input arguments (like a mini-form definition).
127:     *   Creates an internal `Tool` object containing all this information (the function itself, its name, description, argument schema).
128: *   The `ToolManager` stores this `Tool` object in its internal dictionary, keyed by the name `"add"`.
129: 
130: **2. Invocation (When a client calls the tool):**
131: 
132: *   A client sends an MCP message: `{"method": "callTool", "params": {"name": "add", "arguments": {"num1": 5, "num2": 7}}}`.
133: *   `FastMCP` receives this message and identifies it as a `callTool` request for the tool named `add`.
134: *   `FastMCP` calls its internal `call_tool` handler method.
135: *   This handler asks the `ToolManager`: "Please execute the tool named `add` with arguments `{'num1': 5, 'num2': 7}`." (calling `_tool_manager.call_tool`).
136: *   The `ToolManager` looks up `"add"` in its dictionary and finds the corresponding `Tool` object.
137: *   The `Tool` object (or the `ToolManager` using it) validates the provided arguments (`{'num1': 5, 'num2': 7}`) against the stored argument schema (checks if `num1` and `num2` are present and are integers).
138: *   If validation passes, the `Tool` object calls the original Python function (`add_numbers`) with the arguments unpacked: `add_numbers(num1=5, num2=7)`.
139: *   Your `add_numbers` function runs, calculates `12`, and returns it.
140: *   The `ToolManager` receives the result `12`.
141: *   `FastMCP` takes the result, packages it into a valid MCP `callTool` response message, and sends it back to the client.
142: 
143: **Simplified Sequence Diagram (`callTool` for `add`):**

163: ```
164: 
165: **Looking at the Code (Briefly):**
166: 
167: You don't need to memorize this, but seeing the structure can help.
168: 
169: *   **Registration (`@server.tool` -> `add_tool` -> `ToolManager.add_tool`)**:
170:     *   In `server/fastmcp/server.py`, the `FastMCP.tool` decorator returns an inner function that calls `self.add_tool(fn, ...)`.
171:     *   `FastMCP.add_tool` simply calls `self._tool_manager.add_tool(fn, ...)`.
172: 
173:     ```python
174:     # Inside server/fastmcp/tools/tool_manager.py (Simplified ToolManager.add_tool)
175:     from .base import Tool # Tool class definition is in base.py
176: 
177:     class ToolManager:
178:         # ... (init, get_tool, list_tools) ...
179: 
180:         def add_tool(self, fn, name=None, description=None) -> Tool:
181:             # 1. Create a Tool object from the function
182:             tool = Tool.from_function(fn, name=name, description=description)
183:             # 2. Check for duplicates (optional warning)
184:             if tool.name in self._tools:
185:                 # ... handle duplicate ...
186:                 pass
187:             # 3. Store the Tool object in the dictionary
188:             self._tools[tool.name] = tool
189:             logger.debug(f"Registered tool: {tool.name}")
190:             return tool
191:     ```
192: 
193: *   **Invocation (`FastMCP.call_tool` -> `ToolManager.call_tool` -> `Tool.run`)**:
194:     *   In `server/fastmcp/server.py`, the `FastMCP.call_tool` method (which handles incoming `callTool` requests) calls `self._tool_manager.call_tool(name, arguments, ...)`.
195: 
196:     ```python
197:     # Inside server/fastmcp/tools/tool_manager.py (Simplified ToolManager.call_tool)
198:     class ToolManager:
199:         # ... (init, add_tool, list_tools) ...
200: 
201:         async def call_tool(self, name, arguments, context=None):
202:             # 1. Find the tool by name
203:             tool = self.get_tool(name)
204:             if not tool:
205:                 raise ToolError(f"Unknown tool: {name}")
206: 
207:             # 2. Tell the Tool object to run with the arguments
208:             logger.debug(f"Calling tool: {name} with args: {arguments}")
209:             result = await tool.run(arguments, context=context)
210:             return result
211:     ```
212: 
213:     *   The `Tool.run` method (in `server/fastmcp/tools/base.py`) handles argument validation (using the `FuncMetadata` generated during registration) and finally calls your original Python function (`add_numbers`).
214: 
215: ## Conclusion
216: 
217: You've now learned about FastMCP Tools, the way to expose actions and computations from your server for clients to execute.
218: 
219: *   **Tools (`Tool`)** are server-side functions callable by clients, identified by a name.
220: *   The **`ToolManager`** is the internal component that registers and dispatches tool calls (like a workshop foreman).
221: *   The **`@server.tool()`** decorator is the easy way to register a Python function as a tool.
222: *   **Type hints** in your function signature are essential for defining the tool's arguments and return type, enabling automatic validation and documentation.
223: *   Clients use `listTools` to discover tools and `callTool` to execute them.
224: 
225: Tools are fundamental for building interactive applications where the client needs the server to perform specific tasks beyond just retrieving data.
226: 
227: In the next chapter, we'll explore another powerful feature of `FastMCP` for interacting with Large Language Models: [Chapter 5: FastMCP Prompts (`Prompt`, `PromptManager`)](05_fastmcp_prompts___prompt____promptmanager__.md).

  8: # Chapter 5: Reusable Chat Starters - FastMCP Prompts (`Prompt`, `PromptManager`)
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 4: FastMCP Tools (`Tool`, `ToolManager`)](04_fastmcp_tools___tool____toolmanager__.md), we learned how to give our server specific *actions* it can perform, like a calculator tool. But modern AI often involves conversations, especially with Large Language Models (LLMs). How do we manage the instructions and conversation starters we send to these models?
 11: 
 12: Imagine you want to build an AI assistant tool that can summarize text. You'll need to tell the underlying LLM *what* to do (summarize) and *what* text to summarize. You might also want to provide specific instructions like "Keep the summary under 50 words." You'll probably need variations of this prompt for different tasks. Writing this message structure over and over again in your tool code would be repetitive and hard to manage.
 13: 
 14: This is where **FastMCP Prompts** come in. They provide a way to create reusable templates for generating sequences of messages, perfect for starting conversations with LLMs or structuring requests.
 15: 
 16: ## The Mad Libs Analogy: Prompts and the Prompt Manager
 17: 
 18: Think of a **`Prompt`** like a **Mad Libs story template**. A Mad Libs template has a pre-written story with blanks (like `___(noun)___` or `___(verb)___`). You define the structure and the blanks.
 19: 
 20: *   **`Prompt`**: The Mad Libs template itself. It has a name (like "Vacation Story") and defined blanks. In FastMCP, the "story" is a sequence of messages (usually for an LLM), and the blanks are **`PromptArgument`** objects.
 21: *   **`PromptArgument`**: Represents a blank in the template. It defines the name of the blank (e.g., `text_to_summarize`), maybe a description, and whether it's required.
 22: *   **Rendering**: The act of filling in the blanks. You provide values (arguments) for the blanks (`text_to_summarize = "Once upon a time..."`), and the template generates the complete story. In FastMCP, rendering a `Prompt` with arguments produces a list of **`PromptMessage`** objects (like `UserMessage` or `AssistantMessage`). These messages have roles (`user`, `assistant`) and content, ready to be sent to an LLM.
 23: *   **`PromptManager`**: Like a folder or binder holding all your different Mad Libs templates. It's the part of `FastMCP` that stores and helps you find and use (`render`) your defined `Prompt` templates.
 24: 
 25: Clients (like an AI application) can ask the `PromptManager` (via `FastMCP`) to list available prompt templates (`listPrompts`) and then request a specific, filled-in prompt sequence using its name and arguments (`getPrompt`).
 26: 
 27: ## Creating Your First Prompt Template: Using `@server.prompt()`
 28: 
 29: Just like `@server.tool()` and `@server.resource()`, `FastMCP` provides a simple decorator, `@server.prompt()`, to easily define these message templates using Python functions.
 30: 
 31: Let's create a prompt template for our text summarization task.
 32: 
 33: **File: `summarizer_server.py`**
 34: 
 35: ```python
 36: # 1. Import FastMCP and message types
 37: from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
 38: from mcp.server.fastmcp.prompts import UserMessage # We'll use this
 39: 
 40: # 2. Create the server instance
 41: server = FastMCP(name="SummarizerServer")
 42: 
 43: # 3. Use the @server.prompt() decorator to define our template
 44: @server.prompt(name="summarize_text", description="Generates messages to ask an LLM to summarize text.")
 45: def create_summary_prompt(text_to_summarize: str) -> list[UserMessage]:
 46:   """
 47:   This function defines the 'summarize_text' prompt template.
 48:   'text_to_summarize: str' defines a required argument (a blank).
 49:   '-> list[UserMessage]' indicates it returns a list of messages.
 50:   """
 51:   print(f"Rendering prompt 'summarize_text' with text: {text_to_summarize[:30]}...") # Log
 52: 
 53:   # 4. Construct the message(s) based on the arguments
 54:   # Here, we create a single user message containing instructions and the text.
 55:   prompt_content = f"Please summarize the following text concisely:\n\n{text_to_summarize}"
 56: 
 57:   # Return a list containing one UserMessage object
 58:   return [UserMessage(content=prompt_content)]
 59: 
 60: # 5. Standard run block (optional: add a tool that uses this prompt later)
 61: if __name__ == "__main__":
 62:     print(f"Starting {server.name}...")
 63:     server.run()
 64:     print(f"{server.name} finished.")
 65: ```
 66: 
 67: **Explanation:**
 68: 
 69: 1.  **Imports**: We import `FastMCP` and `UserMessage` (a specific type of `PromptMessage`). `AssistantMessage` is also available.
 70: 2.  **`server = FastMCP(...)`**: Creates our server. Internally, this also creates a `PromptManager`.
 71: 3.  **`@server.prompt(...)`**: This decorator registers our function as a prompt template.
 72:     *   `name="summarize_text"`: The name clients will use to request this template.
 73:     *   `description="..."`: A helpful description.
 74: 4.  **`def create_summary_prompt(...)`**: This Python function *builds* the message list when the prompt is rendered.
 75:     *   `text_to_summarize: str`: The type hint defines a required `PromptArgument` named `text_to_summarize`. This is the blank in our Mad Libs.
 76:     *   `-> list[UserMessage]`: The type hint tells `FastMCP` that this function will return a list containing `UserMessage` objects (or compatible types like plain strings or dicts that look like messages).
 77:     *   The function body uses the input argument (`text_to_summarize`) to construct the desired message content.
 78:     *   It returns a list containing a single `UserMessage`. You could return multiple messages (e.g., alternating user/assistant roles) to set up a conversation history.
 79: 5.  **`server.run()`**: Starts the server. The `PromptManager` now knows about the `summarize_text` prompt template.
 80: 
 81: **What happens when a client uses this prompt?**
 82: 
 83: 1.  **Discovery (Optional):** A client might call `listPrompts`. The server (using `PromptManager`) would respond with information about the `summarize_text` prompt, including its name, description, and the required argument `text_to_summarize` (string).
 84: 2.  **Rendering Request:** The client wants to generate the messages for summarizing a specific text. It sends an MCP request: `getPrompt` with `name="summarize_text"` and `arguments={"text_to_summarize": "This is the text..."}`.
 85: 3.  **Server-Side Rendering:**
 86:     *   `FastMCP` receives the request and asks its `PromptManager` to render the prompt.
 87:     *   `PromptManager` finds the `Prompt` object associated with `summarize_text`.
 88:     *   It calls the `render` method on the `Prompt` object, which in turn calls your Python function `create_summary_prompt(text_to_summarize="This is the text...")`.
 89:     *   Your function runs, builds the `prompt_content` string, and returns `[UserMessage(content="Please summarize...")]`.
 90:     *   `FastMCP` takes this list of `Message` objects.
 91: 4.  **Response:** `FastMCP` sends the generated message list back to the client in the `getPrompt` response. The client now has the structured message(s) ready to be sent to an LLM.

120: 
121: This makes it easy for client applications to get consistently formatted prompts for various tasks without needing to know the exact text structure themselves.
122: 
123: ## Returning Different Message Types
124: 
125: Your prompt function can return various things, and `FastMCP` will try to convert them into the standard `Message` format (like `UserMessage` or `AssistantMessage`):
126: 
127: *   **A single string:** Automatically converted to `UserMessage(content=TextContent(type="text", text=your_string))`.
128: *   **A `Message` object (e.g., `UserMessage`, `AssistantMessage`):** Used directly.
129: *   **A dictionary matching the `Message` structure:** e.g., `{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}`. Validated and converted.
130: *   **A list containing any mix of the above:** Each item is converted/validated.
131: 
132: ```python
133: from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
134: # Import both message types
135: from mcp.server.fastmcp.prompts import UserMessage, AssistantMessage
136: 
137: server = FastMCP(name="MultiMessageServer")
138: 
139: @server.prompt(name="greet_user", description="Starts a simple conversation.")
140: def greeting_prompt(user_name: str): # -> returns list of mixed types
141:   """Generates a multi-turn conversation starter."""
142: 
143:   # We can return a list containing different types:
144:   return [
145:       # A UserMessage object
146:       UserMessage(f"Hello {user_name}, tell me about your day."),
147:       # A dictionary that looks like an AssistantMessage
148:       {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm ready to listen!"},
149:       # A simple string (becomes a UserMessage)
150:       "Start whenever you're ready.",
151:   ]
152: 
153: # ... (run block) ...
154: ```
155: 
156: This flexibility lets you structure complex conversational prompts easily.
157: 
158: ## How Prompts Work Under the Hood
159: 
160: Using `@server.prompt()` is straightforward, but what's happening inside `FastMCP` and its `PromptManager`?
161: 
162: **1. Registration (When the server code loads):**
163: 
164: *   Python executes your `summarizer_server.py`.
165: *   It reaches the `@server.prompt(name="summarize_text", ...)` line above `def create_summary_prompt(...)`.
166: *   This calls the `server.prompt()` method (in `server/fastmcp/server.py`). This method returns a decorator function that is immediately applied to `create_summary_prompt`.
167: *   The decorator function calls `server.add_prompt()`.
168: *   `server.add_prompt()` calls `self._prompt_manager.add_prompt()`.
169: *   Inside `PromptManager.add_prompt` (in `server/fastmcp/prompts/manager.py`):
170:     *   It calls `Prompt.from_function(create_summary_prompt, name="summarize_text", ...)` (see `server/fastmcp/prompts/base.py`).
171:     *   `Prompt.from_function` inspects the `create_summary_prompt` function:
172:         *   Gets its name (`summarize_text`).
173:         *   Gets its description (from decorator or docstring).
174:         *   Looks at the parameters (`text_to_summarize: str`) using Python's introspection to determine the required `PromptArgument`s.
175:         *   Creates a `Prompt` object storing the function itself (`fn`), its name, description, and the list of arguments.
176:     *   The `PromptManager` stores this `Prompt` object in its internal dictionary, keyed by the name `"summarize_text"`.
177: 
178: **2. Rendering (When a client calls `getPrompt`):**
179: 
180: *   A client sends the MCP `getPrompt` request we saw earlier.
181: *   `FastMCP` receives this and calls its internal `get_prompt` handler method (defined in `server/fastmcp/server.py`).
182: *   This handler calls `self._prompt_manager.render_prompt("summarize_text", {"text_to_summarize": "..."})`.
183: *   Inside `PromptManager.render_prompt`:
184:     *   It looks up `"summarize_text"` in its dictionary and finds the corresponding `Prompt` object.
185:     *   It calls the `Prompt` object's `render` method: `prompt.render(arguments={"text_to_summarize": "..."})`.
186: *   Inside `Prompt.render` (in `server/fastmcp/prompts/base.py`):
187:     *   It validates that all required arguments (like `text_to_summarize`) were provided.
188:     *   It calls the original Python function stored in `prompt.fn`: `create_summary_prompt(text_to_summarize="...")`.
189:     *   Your function executes and returns the list `[UserMessage(...)]`.
190:     *   The `render` method takes this result, validates that each item is (or can be converted to) a `Message` object, and ensures the final output is a list of `Message`s.
191: *   The `PromptManager` receives this validated list of `Message` objects.
192: *   `FastMCP` takes the result, packages it into the standard MCP `GetPromptResult` format (which contains the `messages` list), and sends it back to the client.

215: 
216: **Looking at the Code (Briefly):**
217: 
218: You don't need to memorize the internal details, but seeing where things happen can clarify the process:
219: 
220: *   **Registration (`@server.prompt` -> `add_prompt` -> `PromptManager.add_prompt`)**:
221:     *   `server.py`: `FastMCP.prompt` decorator calls `self.add_prompt`.
222:     *   `server.py`: `FastMCP.add_prompt` calls `self._prompt_manager.add_prompt`.
223:     *   `manager.py`: `PromptManager.add_prompt` calls `Prompt.from_function` and stores the result.
224: 
225:     ```python
226:     # Inside server/fastmcp/prompts/manager.py (Simplified PromptManager.add_prompt)
227:     from .base import Prompt
228: 
229:     class PromptManager:
230:         # ... (init, get_prompt, list_prompts) ...
231: 
232:         def add_prompt(self, prompt: Prompt) -> Prompt:
233:             # Check for duplicates...
234:             if prompt.name in self._prompts:
235:                  # ... handle duplicate ...
236:                  pass
237:             # Store the Prompt object
238:             self._prompts[prompt.name] = prompt
239:             return prompt
240: 
241:     # Note: Prompt.from_function (in base.py) does the function inspection.
242:     ```
243: 
244: *   **Rendering (`FastMCP.get_prompt` -> `PromptManager.render_prompt` -> `Prompt.render`)**:
245:     *   `server.py`: `FastMCP.get_prompt` handles incoming requests and calls `self._prompt_manager.render_prompt`.
246: 
247:     ```python
248:     # Inside server/fastmcp/prompts/manager.py (Simplified PromptManager.render_prompt)
249:     class PromptManager:
250:         # ... (other methods) ...
251: 
252:         async def render_prompt(self, name, arguments=None):
253:             # 1. Find the prompt object by name
254:             prompt = self.get_prompt(name)
255:             if not prompt:
256:                 raise ValueError(f"Unknown prompt: {name}")
257: 
258:             # 2. Tell the Prompt object to render itself
259:             return await prompt.render(arguments)
260:     ```
261: 
262:     *   `base.py`: `Prompt.render` validates arguments and calls the stored function (`self.fn`). It then processes the function's return value into a list of `Message` objects.
263: 
264:     ```python
265:     # Inside server/fastmcp/prompts/base.py (Simplified Prompt.render)
266:     class Prompt:
267:         # ... (init, from_function, PromptArgument) ...
268: 
269:         async def render(self, arguments=None):
270:             # Validate required arguments...
271:             # ...
272: 
273:             try:
274:                 # Call the original decorated function
275:                 result = self.fn(**(arguments or {}))
276:                 if inspect.iscoroutine(result): # Handle async functions
277:                     result = await result
278: 
279:                 # Convert result to list of Message objects
280:                 # (Handles strings, dicts, Message objects, lists)
281:                 messages: list[Message] = []
282:                 # ... (conversion logic using message_validator) ...
283:                 return messages
284:             except Exception as e:
285:                 raise ValueError(f"Error rendering prompt {self.name}: {e}")
286:     ```
287: 
288: ## Conclusion
289: 
290: You've learned about FastMCP Prompts, a powerful way to manage reusable message templates, especially useful for interacting with language models.
291: 
292: *   **Prompts (`Prompt`)** are like Mad Libs templates for creating sequences of `UserMessage`s and `AssistantMessage`s.
293: *   They use **`PromptArgument`**s to define the "blanks" that need filling.
294: *   The **`PromptManager`** keeps track of all defined prompts.
295: *   The **`@server.prompt()`** decorator provides an easy way to define a prompt template using a Python function. The function's parameters become arguments, and its return value (string, dict, Message object, or list thereof) defines the generated message sequence.
296: *   Clients use `listPrompts` to discover templates and `getPrompt` to render a specific template with arguments, receiving the generated messages back.
297: 
298: Prompts help keep your LLM interaction logic organized, reusable, and separate from your main tool code.
299: 
300: In the next chapter, we'll explore a concept that ties tools, resources, and potentially prompts together during a request: [Chapter 6: FastMCP Context (`Context`)](06_fastmcp_context___context__.md). This allows your tools and resources to access server capabilities like logging and progress reporting.

  8: # Chapter 6: Talking Back - FastMCP Context (`Context`)
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 5: Reusable Chat Starters - FastMCP Prompts (`Prompt`, `PromptManager`)](05_fastmcp_prompts___prompt____promptmanager__.md), we learned how to create reusable message templates for interacting with AI models. We've seen how to build servers with data resources ([Chapter 3](03_fastmcp_resources___resource____resourcemanager__.md)) and action tools ([Chapter 4](04_fastmcp_tools___tool____toolmanager__.md)).
 11: 
 12: But imagine you have a tool that takes a while to run, like processing a large file or making a complex calculation. How does your tool communicate back to the user *while* it's running? How can it say "I'm 50% done!" or log important steps? Or what if a tool needs to read some data from one of the server's resources to do its job?
 13: 
 14: This is where the **`Context`** object comes in. It's like giving your tool function a temporary **backstage pass** for the specific request it's handling. This pass grants it access to special features like sending logs, reporting progress, or accessing other parts of the server environment related to that request.
 15: 
 16: ## What is `Context`?
 17: 
 18: The `Context` object is a special helper object provided by the `FastMCP` framework. If you define a tool function (or a resource function) that includes a parameter specifically typed as `Context`, `FastMCP` will automatically create and pass this object to your function when it's called.
 19: 
 20: Think of it this way:
 21: *   Each client request (like `callTool` or `readResource`) is like a separate event.
 22: *   For that specific event, `FastMCP` can provide a `Context` object.
 23: *   This `Context` object holds information about *that specific request* (like its unique ID).
 24: *   It also provides methods (functions) to interact with the ongoing session, such as:
 25:     *   Sending log messages back to the client (`ctx.info`, `ctx.debug`, etc.).
 26:     *   Reporting progress updates (`ctx.report_progress`).
 27:     *   Reading data from other resources defined on the server (`ctx.read_resource`).
 28: 
 29: It's your function's way of communicating out or accessing shared server capabilities during its execution for a particular request.
 30: 
 31: ## Getting Access: Asking for the `Context`
 32: 
 33: How do you tell `FastMCP` that your function needs this backstage pass? You simply add a parameter to your function definition and use a **type hint** to mark it as `Context`.
 34: 
 35: Let's create a tool that simulates a long-running task and uses `Context` to report progress and log messages.
 36: 
 37: **File: `long_task_server.py`**
 38: 
 39: ```python
 40: import anyio # For simulating delay with sleep
 41: from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
 42: # 1. Import the Context type
 43: from mcp.server.fastmcp.server import Context
 44: 
 45: # Create the server instance
 46: server = FastMCP(name="LongTaskServer")
 47: 
 48: # Define our tool function
 49: # 2. Add a parameter (e.g., 'ctx') and type hint it as 'Context'
 50: @server.tool(name="long_task", description="Simulates a task that takes time.")
 51: async def run_long_task(duration_seconds: int, ctx: Context) -> str:
 52:   """
 53:   Simulates a task, reporting progress and logging using Context.
 54:   """
 55:   # 3. Use the context object!
 56:   await ctx.info(f"Starting long task for {duration_seconds} seconds.")
 57: 
 58:   total_steps = 5
 59:   for i in range(total_steps):
 60:       step = i + 1
 61:       await ctx.debug(f"Working on step {step}/{total_steps}...")
 62:       # Simulate work
 63:       await anyio.sleep(duration_seconds / total_steps)
 64:       # Report progress (current step, total steps)
 65:       await ctx.report_progress(step, total_steps)
 66: 
 67:   await ctx.info("Long task completed!")
 68:   return f"Finished simulated task of {duration_seconds} seconds."
 69: 
 70: # Standard run block
 71: if __name__ == "__main__":
 72:     print(f"Starting {server.name}...")
 73:     server.run()
 74:     print(f"{server.name} finished.")
 75: ```
 76: 
 77: **Explanation:**
 78: 
 79: 1.  **`from mcp.server.fastmcp.server import Context`**: We import the necessary `Context` class.
 80: 2.  **`async def run_long_task(duration_seconds: int, ctx: Context)`**:
 81:     *   We define our tool function as usual.
 82:     *   Crucially, we add a parameter named `ctx`. You can name it anything (like `context`, `req_ctx`), but `ctx` is common.
 83:     *   We add the type hint `: Context` after the parameter name. This is the signal to `FastMCP` to inject the context object here.
 84: 3.  **Using `ctx`**: Inside the function, we can now use the methods provided by the `ctx` object:
 85:     *   `await ctx.info(...)`: Sends an informational log message back to the client connected to this session.
 86:     *   `await ctx.debug(...)`: Sends a debug-level log message. There are also `warning` and `error` methods.
 87:     *   `await ctx.report_progress(step, total_steps)`: Sends a progress update to the client. The client application might display this in a progress bar.
 88: 
 89: When a client calls the `long_task` tool, `FastMCP` will:
 90: 1.  See the `ctx: Context` parameter.
 91: 2.  Create a `Context` object specific to this request.
 92: 3.  Call your `run_long_task` function, passing the duration and the newly created `ctx` object.
 93: 4.  Your function runs, and calls like `ctx.info` or `ctx.report_progress` send messages back to the client *during* the execution of the tool.
 94: 
 95: ## Using `Context` to Access Resources
 96: 
 97: The `Context` object isn't just for sending information *out*; it can also be used to access other parts of the server, like reading resources defined using `@server.resource`.
 98: 
 99: Let's modify our example. Imagine our long task needs some configuration data stored in a resource.
100: 
101: **File: `long_task_server_with_resource.py`**
102: 
103: ```python
104: import anyio
105: from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
106: from mcp.server.fastmcp.server import Context
107: 
108: # Create the server instance
109: server = FastMCP(name="LongTaskServer")
110: 
111: # Define a simple resource that holds some config data
112: @server.resource(uri="config://task_settings", description="Settings for the long task.")
113: def get_task_settings() -> str:
114:   """Returns task settings as a simple string."""
115:   # In a real app, this might load from a file or database
116:   print("Resource 'config://task_settings' was read!")
117:   return "Default speed: Normal" # Simple example setting
118: 
119: # Define our tool function
120: @server.tool(name="long_task", description="Simulates a task using config resource.")
121: async def run_long_task(duration_seconds: int, ctx: Context) -> str:
122:   """
123:   Simulates a task, reads config via Context, reports progress.
124:   """
125:   await ctx.info(f"Starting long task for {duration_seconds} seconds.")
126: 
127:   # 1. Use context to read the resource
128:   try:
129:       # read_resource returns a list of content chunks
130:       resource_contents = await ctx.read_resource("config://task_settings")
131:       # Assuming simple text content for this example
132:       settings = ""
133:       for content_part in resource_contents:
134:           if hasattr(content_part, 'content') and isinstance(content_part.content, str):
135:               settings = content_part.content
136:               break
137:       await ctx.info(f"Loaded settings: {settings}")
138:   except Exception as e:
139:       await ctx.warning(f"Could not read task settings: {e}")
140: 
141: 
142:   total_steps = 5
143:   for i in range(total_steps):
144:       step = i + 1
145:       await ctx.debug(f"Working on step {step}/{total_steps}...")
146:       await anyio.sleep(duration_seconds / total_steps)
147:       await ctx.report_progress(step, total_steps)
148: 
149:   await ctx.info("Long task completed!")
150:   return f"Finished simulated task of {duration_seconds} seconds using settings."
151: 
152: # Standard run block
153: if __name__ == "__main__":
154:     print(f"Starting {server.name}...")
155:     server.run()
156:     print(f"{server.name} finished.")
157: ```
158: 
159: **Explanation:**
160: 
161: 1.  **`@server.resource(...)`**: We added a simple resource named `config://task_settings` that just returns a string.
162: 2.  **`resource_contents = await ctx.read_resource("config://task_settings")`**: Inside our `run_long_task` tool, we now use `ctx.read_resource()` to fetch the content of our configuration resource. This allows the tool to dynamically access data managed by the server without having direct access to the resource's implementation function (`get_task_settings`).
163: 3.  **Processing Content**: The `read_resource` method returns an iterable of `ReadResourceContents` objects (often just one). We extracted the string content to use it.
164: 
165: Now, our tool can both communicate outwards (logs, progress) and interact inwards (read resources) using the same `Context` object, all within the scope of the single request it's handling.
166: 
167: ## How `Context` Works Under the Hood
168: 
169: It feels like magic that just adding `: Context` gives your function these powers, but it's a well-defined process within `FastMCP`.
170: 
171: 1.  **Request Arrives:** A client sends a request, for example, `callTool` for our `long_task`.
172: 2.  **Low-Level Handling:** The underlying `MCPServer` receives the request and creates a `RequestContext` object. This low-level context holds the raw request details, a reference to the current `ServerSession`, and the request ID.
173: 3.  **`FastMCP` Takes Over:** The request is routed to the appropriate `FastMCP` handler method (e.g., `FastMCP.call_tool`).
174: 4.  **Context Creation:** Before calling the actual tool function, `FastMCP` calls its internal `get_context()` method. This method creates the high-level `Context` object we use. It wraps the low-level `RequestContext` and also adds a reference to the `FastMCP` server instance itself.
175: 5.  **Function Inspection:** The `ToolManager` (when asked to run the tool) inspects the signature of your target function (`run_long_task`). It sees the `ctx: Context` parameter.
176: 6.  **Injection:** The `ToolManager` (specifically the `Tool.run` method which uses `FuncMetadata.call_fn_with_arg_validation`) knows it needs to provide a `Context` object. It takes the `Context` created in step 4 and passes it as the argument for the `ctx` parameter when calling your `run_long_task` function.
177: 7.  **Execution:** Your function runs. When you call `ctx.info("...")`, the `Context` object uses its reference to the underlying `RequestContext` and `ServerSession` to send the appropriate log message back to the client via the session. Similarly, `ctx.report_progress` uses the session, and `ctx.read_resource` uses the reference to the `FastMCP` instance to call its `read_resource` method.

209: ```
210: 
211: **Looking at the Code (Briefly):**
212: 
213: *   **Context Creation (`server/fastmcp/server.py`)**: The `FastMCP.get_context` method is responsible for creating the `Context` object when needed, typically just before calling a tool or resource handler. It grabs the low-level context and wraps it.
214: 
215:     ```python
216:     # Inside server/fastmcp/server.py (Simplified FastMCP.get_context)
217:     from mcp.shared.context import RequestContext # Low-level context
218: 
219:     class FastMCP:
220:         # ... (other methods) ...
221: 
222:         def get_context(self) -> Context[ServerSession, object]:
223:             """Returns a Context object."""
224:             try:
225:                 # Get the low-level context for the current request
226:                 request_context: RequestContext | None = self._mcp_server.request_context
227:             except LookupError:
228:                 request_context = None # Not available outside a request
229: 
230:             # Create our high-level Context, passing the low-level one
231:             # and a reference to this FastMCP instance ('self')
232:             return Context(request_context=request_context, fastmcp=self)
233:     ```
234: 
235: *   **Context Injection (`server/fastmcp/tools/base.py`)**: The `Tool.from_function` method inspects the function signature to see if a `Context` parameter exists and stores its name (`context_kwarg`). Later, `Tool.run` uses this information (via `FuncMetadata`) to pass the context object when calling your function.
236: 
237:     ```python
238:     # Inside server/fastmcp/tools/base.py (Simplified Tool.from_function)
239:     class Tool(BaseModel):
240:         # ... fields ...
241:         context_kwarg: str | None = Field(...)
242: 
243:         @classmethod
244:         def from_function(cls, fn, ...) -> Tool:
245:             # ... other inspection ...
246:             context_param_name = None
247:             sig = inspect.signature(fn)
248:             for param_name, param in sig.parameters.items():
249:                 # Check if the type hint is Context
250:                 if param.annotation is Context:
251:                     context_param_name = param_name
252:                     break
253:             # ... create FuncMetadata, skipping context arg ...
254:             return cls(
255:                 # ...,
256:                 context_kwarg=context_param_name,
257:                 # ...
258:             )
259: 
260:     # Inside Tool.run (simplified concept)
261:     async def run(self, arguments, context=None):
262:         # ... validate args ...
263:         kwargs_for_fn = validated_args
264:         if self.context_kwarg and context:
265:              # Add the context object to the arguments passed to the function
266:             kwargs_for_fn[self.context_kwarg] = context
267: 
268:         # Call the original function (self.fn)
269:         result = await self.fn(**kwargs_for_fn) # Or sync call
270:         return result
271:     ```
272: 
273: *   **Context Implementation (`server/fastmcp/server.py`)**: The `Context` class itself implements methods like `info`, `report_progress`, `read_resource` by calling methods on the stored `_request_context.session` or `_fastmcp` instance.
274: 
275:     ```python
276:     # Inside server/fastmcp/server.py (Simplified Context methods)
277:     class Context(BaseModel, Generic[ServerSessionT, LifespanContextT]):
278:         _request_context: RequestContext[...] | None
279:         _fastmcp: FastMCP | None
280:         # ... (init, properties) ...
281: 
282:         async def report_progress(self, progress, total=None):
283:             # Get progress token from low-level context meta if available
284:             progress_token = self.request_context.meta.progressToken if self.request_context.meta else None
285:             if progress_token:
286:                 # Use the session object from the low-level context
287:                 await self.request_context.session.send_progress_notification(...)
288: 
289:         async def read_resource(self, uri):
290:             # Use the stored FastMCP instance
291:             assert self._fastmcp is not None
292:             return await self._fastmcp.read_resource(uri)
293: 
294:         async def log(self, level, message, ...):
295:              # Use the session object from the low-level context
296:             await self.request_context.session.send_log_message(...)
297: 
298:         async def info(self, message, **extra):
299:             await self.log("info", message, **extra)
300:         # ... (debug, warning, error methods) ...
301:     ```
302: 
303: ## Conclusion
304: 
305: You've learned about the `Context` object in `FastMCP` – your function's essential backstage pass during a request.
306: 
307: *   `Context` provides access to request-specific information and server capabilities.
308: *   You gain access by adding a parameter type-hinted as `Context` to your tool or resource function definition.
309: *   It allows your functions to:
310:     *   Send log messages (`ctx.info`, `ctx.debug`, etc.).
311:     *   Report progress (`ctx.report_progress`).
312:     *   Read server resources (`ctx.read_resource`).
313:     *   Access request details (`ctx.request_id`).
314: *   `FastMCP` automatically creates and injects the `Context` object when your function is called for a specific request.
315: 
316: The `Context` object is key to building more interactive and communicative tools and resources that can provide feedback to the user and interact with their environment during execution.
317: 
318: So far, we've focused on the high-level abstractions `FastMCP` provides (`Tool`, `Resource`, `Prompt`, `Context`). In the next chapter, we'll take a step back and look at the fundamental data structures defined by the MCP specification itself: [Chapter 7: MCP Protocol Types](07_mcp_protocol_types.md). Understanding these types helps clarify the data being exchanged between clients and servers under the hood.

  8: # Chapter 7: MCP Protocol Types - The Standard Language
  9: 
 10: In the previous chapter, [Chapter 6: Talking Back - FastMCP Context (`Context`)](06_fastmcp_context___context__.md), we saw how the `Context` object gives our tools and resources a "backstage pass" to send logs, report progress, and access other server features during a request. We've built up a good understanding of how `FastMCP` helps us create powerful servers with tools ([Chapter 4](04_fastmcp_tools___tool____toolmanager__.md)), resources ([Chapter 3](03_fastmcp_resources___resource____resourcemanager__.md)), and prompts ([Chapter 5](05_fastmcp_prompts___prompt____promptmanager__.md)).
 11: 
 12: But have you ever wondered *how* the client and server actually talk to each other under the hood? When your tool function uses `ctx.report_progress()`, how does that message get sent? When a client asks to call a tool, what does that request *look like* electronically?
 13: 
 14: Imagine trying to send mail internationally. If everyone used different envelope sizes, address formats, and languages, it would be chaos! Postal services rely on standards. Similarly, for a client (like a chatbot interface) and your MCP server (like your `CalculatorServer`) to communicate reliably, they need a **standard language** and **standard formats** for their messages.
 15: 
 16: This is where **MCP Protocol Types** come in. They are the fundamental, standardized data structures – the "digital forms" or "letter formats" – defined by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification itself.
 17: 
 18: ## What are MCP Protocol Types?
 19: 
 20: Think of MCP Protocol Types as the official **blueprints** for all the different kinds of messages that can be sent between an MCP client and server. They define precisely what information should be included in each type of message.
 21: 
 22: These types cover all the interactions we've implicitly seen:
 23: 
 24: *   **Requests:** Messages asking the other side to do something (e.g., "Initialize our connection", "List the available tools", "Read this resource", "Call that tool").
 25: *   **Responses:** Messages sent back after a request, containing either the result or an error (e.g., "Here are the tools", "Here is the resource content", "Here is the result of the tool call", "Sorry, an error occurred").
 26: *   **Notifications:** Messages sent one-way, just to inform the other side about something without expecting a direct reply (e.g., "Initialization is complete", "Here's a progress update", "Here's a log message").
 27: *   **Errors:** A specific kind of response indicating something went wrong with a request.
 28: 
 29: These types have specific names defined in the `MCP Python SDK`, usually found in the `mcp.types` module. You'll see names that clearly indicate their purpose:
 30: 
 31: *   `InitializeRequest`: The "form" a client sends to start communication.
 32: *   `InitializeResult`: The "form" a server sends back confirming initialization.
 33: *   `ListToolsResult`: The "form" containing the list of tools sent by the server.
 34: *   `CallToolRequest`: The "form" a client uses to ask the server to run a tool.
 35: *   `CallToolResult`: The "form" the server sends back with the tool's output.
 36: *   `ProgressNotification`: The "form" used to send progress updates (like when we used `ctx.report_progress`).
 37: *   `JSONRPCError`: The standard "form" for reporting errors.
 38: 
 39: These are just a few examples; the MCP specification defines many such types to cover all standard interactions.
 40: 
 41: ## Why Standardized Types? Meet Pydantic
 42: 
 43: Why go to the trouble of defining all these specific types? Why not just send messages like "Hey server, run the add tool with 5 and 7"?
 44: 
 45: Without standards, communication quickly breaks down:
 46: *   Did the client send integers or strings for the numbers?
 47: *   Did the server send the result back as a number or text?
 48: *   How does the client know if the server understood the request or if an error happened?
 49: 
 50: Standardized types solve these problems by ensuring both the client and server agree on the exact structure and data types for every message.
 51: 
 52: The `MCP Python SDK` uses a popular Python library called **Pydantic** to define and manage these protocol types. Think of Pydantic as both the **form designer** and the **quality control inspector**:
 53: 
 54: 1.  **Definition:** Pydantic allows the SDK developers to define each protocol type (like `CallToolRequest`) using simple Python classes with type hints. This creates a clear, code-based blueprint for each "form".
 55: 2.  **Validation:** When your server receives a message, Pydantic automatically checks if it perfectly matches the expected structure defined by the corresponding protocol type. Does the `CallToolRequest` actually have a `name` field that's a string? Does it have an `arguments` field that's a dictionary? If not, Pydantic raises an error immediately, preventing bad data from causing problems later. It does the same when your server sends messages back.
 56: 3.  **Type Safety & Developer Experience:** Because the types are clearly defined, your code editor can help you! It knows what fields exist on an `InitializeResult` object, reducing typos and making development faster and less error-prone.
 57: 
 58: Pydantic makes the communication reliable and robust by enforcing the MCP standard for every message.
 59: 
 60: ## Examples in Action: Connecting High-Level to Low-Level
 61: 
 62: While `FastMCP` does a great job hiding these low-level details, let's peek behind the curtain and see how our previous examples relate to these protocol types.
 63: 
 64: **Scenario 1: Client Listing Tools**
 65: 
 66: 1.  A client wants to know what tools your `CalculatorServer` offers.
 67: 2.  Client sends a message. Under the hood, this message is structured according to the `JSONRPCRequest` format, specifying the method `tools/list`.
 68: 3.  Your `FastMCP` server receives this raw message. Pydantic validates it.
 69: 4.  `FastMCP` understands it's a request for `tools/list` and asks the `ToolManager` ([Chapter 4](04_fastmcp_tools___tool____toolmanager__.md)) for the list of tools.
 70: 5.  The `ToolManager` provides the tool information (name, description, input schema).
 71: 6.  `FastMCP` takes this information and constructs a `ListToolsResult` object. This object is a Pydantic model defined in `mcp.types`.
 72: 
 73:     ```python
 74:     # Simplified example of creating a ListToolsResult object
 75:     # (FastMCP does this automatically for you!)
 76:     from mcp.types import ListToolsResult, Tool
 77: 
 78:     # ToolManager gathered this info from your @server.tool decorator
 79:     add_tool_info = Tool(
 80:         name="add",
 81:         description="Adds two numbers together.",
 82:         inputSchema={ # JSON Schema describing expected input
 83:             "type": "object",
 84:             "properties": {
 85:                 "num1": {"type": "integer"},
 86:                 "num2": {"type": "integer"}
 87:             },
 88:             "required": ["num1", "num2"]
 89:         }
 90:     )
 91: 
 92:     # FastMCP creates the result object
 93:     result_data = ListToolsResult(
 94:         tools=[add_tool_info]
 95:         # nextCursor would be set if paginating
 96:     )
 97: 
 98:     # This result_data object is then packaged into a
 99:     # standard JSONRPCResponse and sent to the client.
100:     print(result_data.model_dump_json(indent=2)) # See its JSON form
101:     ```
102: 
103:     **Example Output (JSON representation):**
104:     ```json
105:     {
106:       "_meta": null,
107:       "nextCursor": null,
108:       "tools": [
109:         {
110:           "name": "add",
111:           "description": "Adds two numbers together.",
112:           "inputSchema": {
113:             "type": "object",
114:             "properties": {
115:               "num1": {
116:                 "type": "integer"
117:               },
118:               "num2": {
119:                 "type": "integer"
120:               }
121:             },
122:             "required": [
123:               "num1",
124:               "num2"
125:             ]
126:           }
127:         }
128:       ]
129:     }
130:     ```
131:     This structured JSON, based on the `ListToolsResult` model, is what gets sent back to the client.
132: 
133: **Scenario 2: Reporting Progress with `Context`**
134: 
135: 1.  Your tool function calls `await ctx.report_progress(step, total_steps)` ([Chapter 6](06_fastmcp_context___context__.md)).
136: 2.  The `Context` object uses the provided `step` and `total_steps` values.
137: 3.  It looks up the unique `progressToken` associated with the original request that started this tool call.
138: 4.  It creates a `ProgressNotificationParams` object containing the token and progress values.
139: 5.  It wraps this in a `ProgressNotification` object.
140: 
141:     ```python
142:     # Simplified example of creating a ProgressNotification
143:     # (Context object does this for you!)
144:     from mcp.types import ProgressNotification, ProgressNotificationParams
145: 
146:     # Context gets these values
147:     token_from_request = "client_progress_token_123"
148:     current_step = 2
149:     total_steps = 5
150:     progress_value = current_step / total_steps # 0.4
151: 
152:     # Context creates the notification object
153:     notification_data = ProgressNotification(
154:         method="notifications/progress", # Standard MCP method name
155:         params=ProgressNotificationParams(
156:             progressToken=token_from_request,
157:             progress=progress_value,
158:             total=float(total_steps)
159:         )
160:     )
161: 
162:     # This notification_data is then packaged into a
163:     # JSONRPCNotification message and sent to the client.
164:     print(notification_data.model_dump_json(indent=2))
165:     ```
166: 
167:     **Example Output (JSON representation):**
168:     ```json
169:     {
170:       "method": "notifications/progress",
171:       "params": {
172:         "_meta": null,
173:         "progressToken": "client_progress_token_123",
174:         "progress": 0.4,
175:         "total": 5.0
176:       }
177:     }
178:     ```
179:     This structured JSON notification, based on the `ProgressNotification` model, is sent to the client to update its UI.
180: 
181: ## Do I Need to Use These Directly?
182: 
183: Probably not, especially when you're starting out and using `FastMCP`!
184: 
185: The beauty of `FastMCP` and its decorators (`@server.tool`, `@server.resource`) and helpers (`Context`) is that they **abstract away** these low-level protocol types. You work with regular Python functions, arguments, and return values, and `FastMCP` handles the conversion to and from the appropriate MCP Protocol Types automatically using Pydantic.
186: 
187: However, understanding that these types exist is valuable:
188: 
189: *   **Debugging:** If you encounter communication errors, the error messages might refer to fields within these specific types (e.g., "Invalid params in CallToolRequest"). Knowing the structure helps diagnose the problem.
190: *   **Advanced Use:** If you ever need to build a custom MCP client, or interact with an MCP server without using the `MCP Python SDK`'s client helpers, you'll need to construct and parse these types yourself.
191: *   **Understanding the Protocol:** Reading the official MCP specification or the SDK's `mcp/types.py` file gives you the ground truth about how communication works.
192: 
193: Think of it like driving a car. You mostly use the steering wheel, pedals, and shifter (like `FastMCP` abstractions). You don't usually interact directly with the engine pistons or fuel injectors (like MCP Protocol Types). But knowing they exist helps you understand how the car works and what might be wrong if it breaks down.

197: Let's visualize where these types fit into a simple `callTool` interaction.

216: ```
217: 
218: This shows that the `CallToolRequest` and `CallToolResult` (which are MCP Protocol Types defined as Pydantic models in `mcp/types.py`) are the actual structures being serialized into JSON messages for transmission and parsed back upon receipt.
219: 
220: You can find the definitions for all these types within the SDK:
221: 
222: **Inside `mcp/types.py` (Example Snippet):**
223: 
224: ```python
225: # This file defines all the standard MCP types using Pydantic
226: 
227: from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
228: from typing import Literal, Any
229: 
230: # Define the base for parameters of progress notifications
231: class ProgressNotificationParams(NotificationParams):
232:     """Parameters for progress notifications."""
233:     progressToken: ProgressToken # Defined elsewhere as str | int
234:     progress: float
235:     total: float | None = None
236:     model_config = ConfigDict(extra="allow")
237: 
238: # Define the notification itself, using the params above
239: class ProgressNotification(
240:     Notification[ProgressNotificationParams, Literal["notifications/progress"]]
241: ):
242:     """
243:     An out-of-band notification used to inform the receiver of a progress update...
244:     """
245:     method: Literal["notifications/progress"]
246:     params: ProgressNotificationParams
247: 
248: # --- Other definitions like Tool, Resource, CallToolRequest etc. ---
249: ```
250: This snippet shows how Pydantic `BaseModel` is used with standard Python type hints (`float`, `str | int`, `Literal["..."]`) to define the structure and expected data types for the `ProgressNotification`.
251: 
252: ## Conclusion
253: 
254: You've learned about MCP Protocol Types – the standardized "digital forms" that define the structure of all communication (requests, responses, notifications, errors) between MCP clients and servers.
255: 
256: *   They are defined by the **MCP specification**.
257: *   The `MCP Python SDK` uses **Pydantic** models (`mcp/types.py`) to represent these types, providing clear definitions and automatic validation for reliable communication.
258: *   Examples include `InitializeRequest`, `ListToolsResult`, `CallToolRequest`, `ProgressNotification`, and `JSONRPCError`.
259: *   While **`FastMCP` largely hides these details**, understanding them provides valuable context for debugging and appreciating the underlying communication mechanics.
260: 
261: These types form the bedrock of MCP communication. Now that we understand the messages themselves, we can look at how connections are managed over time. In the next chapter, we'll explore how the SDK manages the ongoing conversation between a client and server using [Chapter 8: Client/Server Sessions (`ClientSession`, `ServerSession`)](08_client_server_sessions___clientsession____serversession__.md).

  8: # Chapter 8: Client/Server Sessions (`ClientSession`, `ServerSession`)
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 7: MCP Protocol Types](07_mcp_protocol_types.md), we learned about the standardized "digital forms" – the Pydantic models – that define the structure of messages exchanged between an MCP client and server. We saw examples like `CallToolRequest` and `ProgressNotification`.
 11: 
 12: But knowing the *format* of a letter isn't enough. How does a specific conversation between one client and one server actually happen over time? How does the server know which incoming response belongs to which outgoing request it sent earlier? How is the initial connection "hello" handled?
 13: 
 14: Imagine you call a large company's support line. You don't just shout into the void; you get connected to a specific operator who handles *your* call from start to finish. This operator keeps track of your requests, finds the answers, and manages the connection until you hang up.
 15: 
 16: In the `MCP Python SDK`, this "phone line operator" role is played by **Session** objects: `ClientSession` and `ServerSession`.
 17: 
 18: ## What's a Session? The Dedicated Conversation Line
 19: 
 20: A **Session** object (`ClientSession` or `ServerSession`) manages the state and lifecycle of a **single, ongoing connection** between one MCP client and one MCP server. Think of it as establishing a dedicated phone line for one specific conversation.
 21: 
 22: This "operator" handles several crucial tasks for that single connection:
 23: 
 24: 1.  **Initialization:** Manages the initial "handshake" where the client and server introduce themselves, agree on the protocol version, and share their capabilities (like saying "Hello, I can do X, Y, and Z").
 25: 2.  **Sending & Receiving:** Handles the low-level details of sending outgoing messages (requests, notifications) and receiving incoming messages over the communication channel (like Stdio, WebSockets, etc., which we'll cover in [Chapter 9: Communication Transports](09_communication_transports__stdio__sse__websocket__memory_.md)).
 26: 3.  **Request/Response Matching:** When you send a request, it gets a unique ID. When a response comes back later with that same ID, the Session makes sure it's delivered to the part of the code that's waiting for *that specific* answer. It's like the operator remembering who asked which question.
 27: 4.  **State Management:** Keeps track of whether the connection is initializing, active, or closed.
 28: 5.  **Lifecycle:** Manages the setup and eventual teardown (hang-up) of the connection.
 29: 
 30: ## Two Sides of the Coin: `ClientSession` vs. `ServerSession`
 31: 
 32: Why are there two types of sessions? Because the client and server have different roles in the conversation:
 33: 
 34: *   **`ClientSession`**: Represents the *client's* end of the connection. It's primarily responsible for:
 35:     *   *Initiating* the connection and the handshake (`initialize` request).
 36:     *   *Sending* requests to the server (like `callTool`, `readResource`, `getPrompt`).
 37:     *   *Receiving* responses and notifications *from* the server.
 38:     *   Handling server-initiated requests (like asking the client to generate text if the client has that capability).
 39: 
 40: *   **`ServerSession`**: Represents the *server's* end of the connection. It's primarily responsible for:
 41:     *   *Responding* to the client's `initialize` request.
 42:     *   *Receiving* requests *from* the client.
 43:     *   *Sending* responses and notifications *back* to the client (like tool results, resource content, log messages, progress updates).
 44:     *   Handling client-initiated notifications (like `initialized`).
 45: 
 46: They use the same underlying mechanisms but have different methods tailored to their role (e.g., `ClientSession` has `call_tool`, `ServerSession` has `send_log_message`).
 47: 
 48: ## How `FastMCP` Uses `ServerSession` (Behind the Scenes)
 49: 
 50: If you're building a server using `FastMCP` (as we did in chapters [2](02_fastmcp_server___fastmcp__.md) through [6](06_fastmcp_context___context__.md)), you generally **don't interact with `ServerSession` directly**.
 51: 
 52: When a client connects to your `FastMCP` server:
 53: 1.  The underlying transport layer (e.g., Stdio handler) accepts the connection.
 54: 2.  `FastMCP` (or its underlying `MCPServer`) automatically creates a `ServerSession` object specifically for that new client connection.
 55: 3.  This `ServerSession` handles the initialization handshake with the client.
 56: 4.  When the client sends a request (like `callTool`), the `ServerSession` receives it, identifies it, and passes it to the appropriate `FastMCP` handler (which might involve the `ToolManager`).
 57: 5.  When your tool function uses `ctx.info()` or `ctx.report_progress()` ([Chapter 6: FastMCP Context (`Context`)](06_fastmcp_context___context__.md)), the `Context` object talks to its associated `ServerSession` to actually send the `LoggingMessageNotification` or `ProgressNotification` back to the client.
 58: 6.  The `ServerSession` manages this connection until the client disconnects.
 59: 
 60: So, `ServerSession` is the hidden engine powering the communication for each connected client in a `FastMCP` server. You benefit from its work without needing to manage it manually.
 61: 
 62: ## When Might You Use `ClientSession`?
 63: 
 64: You would typically use `ClientSession` if you were writing a standalone Python application that needs to *connect to* and *interact with* an existing MCP server (which might be one you built with `FastMCP` or someone else's).
 65: 
 66: **Example Scenario: A Simple Client**
 67: 
 68: *(This is conceptual; we won't build a full client here.)*
 69: 
 70: Imagine you write a script that needs to ask our `CalculatorServer` ([Chapter 4](04_fastmcp_tools___tool____toolmanager__.md)) to add two numbers.
 71: 
 72: ```python
 73: # --- Conceptual Client Code ---
 74: import anyio
 75: from mcp.client.session import ClientSession
 76: # Assume we have transport streams (read_stream, write_stream)
 77: # connected to the CalculatorServer (more in Chapter 9)
 78: 
 79: async def run_client():
 80:     # 1. Create a ClientSession using the transport streams
 81:     async with ClientSession(read_stream, write_stream) as session:
 82:         try:
 83:             # 2. Perform the initialization handshake
 84:             init_result = await session.initialize()
 85:             print(f"Connected to: {init_result.serverInfo.name}")
 86: 
 87:             # 3. Send a 'callTool' request using the session
 88:             tool_result = await session.call_tool(
 89:                 name="add",
 90:                 arguments={"num1": 15, "num2": 27}
 91:             )
 92: 
 93:             # 4. Process the result (session handled matching response)
 94:             # Assuming the result is simple text content
 95:             if tool_result.content and tool_result.content[0].type == 'text':
 96:                print(f"Server calculated: {tool_result.content[0].text}") # Expected: 42
 97: 
 98:         except Exception as e:
 99:             print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
100: 
101: # In a real script, you'd set up the transport and run this async function
102: # anyio.run(run_client)
103: ```
104: 
105: In this scenario:
106: 1.  We create the `ClientSession`.
107: 2.  We explicitly call `session.initialize()` to start the conversation.
108: 3.  We use `session.call_tool()` to send the request. The `ClientSession` assigns an ID, sends the message, and waits for the specific response with that ID.
109: 4.  The result comes back directly from the `call_tool` method.
110: 
111: ## How Sessions Work Under the Hood: The Operator's Workflow
112: 
113: Let's trace the lifecycle and the request/response matching managed by a session. We'll use our phone operator analogy.
114: 
115: 1.  **Connection Established:** A communication channel (like Stdio or WebSocket, see [Chapter 9](09_communication_transports__stdio__sse__websocket__memory_.md)) is opened between the client and server.
116: 2.  **Session Creation:** A `ClientSession` is created on the client side, and a `ServerSession` on the server side, both linked to this channel.
117: 3.  **Initialization (Handshake):**
118:     *   `ClientSession` sends an `InitializeRequest` (like calling and saying "Hi, I'm ClientApp v1.0, I support MCP v0.3, can we talk?"). It assigns this request ID 0.
119:     *   `ServerSession` receives ID 0. It knows this is the `initialize` method. It checks the protocol version, stores the client's capabilities, and prepares its own info.
120:     *   `ServerSession` sends back an `InitializeResult` linked to ID 0 (like "Yes, I'm CalculatorServer v1.1, I also support v0.3, here are my capabilities...").
121:     *   `ClientSession` receives the response for ID 0. It checks the server's info and considers the handshake successful.
122:     *   `ClientSession` sends an `InitializedNotification` (just saying "Okay, great!").
123:     *   `ServerSession` receives this notification and marks the session as fully initialized. The line is now open for regular business.
124: 4.  **Client Sends Request:**
125:     *   `ClientSession` wants to call the `add` tool. It calls `session.call_tool("add", {...})`.
126:     *   The `ClientSession` assigns a *new* unique ID (e.g., ID 1) to this request.
127:     *   It stores a "waiting placeholder" (an `anyio` event or future) associated with ID 1.
128:     *   It sends the `CallToolRequest` message with ID 1 over the channel.
129: 5.  **Server Processes Request:**
130:     *   `ServerSession` receives the message with ID 1.
131:     *   It sees it's a `callTool` request for `add`.
132:     *   It passes the request details to the `FastMCP` handler (which uses the `ToolManager`).
133:     *   The tool function `add_numbers(15, 27)` runs and returns `42`.
134:     *   `FastMCP` gets the result.
135: 6.  **Server Sends Response:**
136:     *   `ServerSession` constructs a `CallToolResult` containing `42`.
137:     *   It sends this result back over the channel, making sure to include the *original* request ID (ID 1).
138: 7.  **Client Receives Response:**
139:     *   `ClientSession` receives the message with ID 1.
140:     *   It looks up ID 1 in its "waiting placeholders".
141:     *   It finds the placeholder created in step 4 and delivers the received `CallToolResult` to it.
142:     *   The code that was waiting on `session.call_tool(...)` now receives the result (`42`) and continues execution.
143: 8.  **Notifications (Example: Progress):**
144:     *   If the server tool called `ctx.report_progress(...)`, the `Context` tells the `ServerSession`.
145:     *   `ServerSession` constructs a `ProgressNotification` (which doesn't have a request ID, as it's not a response).
146:     *   `ServerSession` sends the notification.
147:     *   `ClientSession` receives the notification. It sees it's not a response to a specific request. It might trigger a callback or event handler registered in the client application to update a progress bar.
148: 9.  **Hang-up:** When the connection closes (client exits, server shuts down, network error), the sessions clean up their resources.
149: 
150: **Simplified Sequence Diagram (Client Calls Tool):**
151: 
152: ```mermaid
153: sequenceDiagram
154:     participant ClientApp
155:     participant ClientSess as ClientSession
156:     participant ServerSess as ServerSession
157:     participant ServerTool as Tool Function (e.g., add_numbers)
158: 
159:     ClientApp->>+ClientSess: call_tool("add", {num1: 15, num2: 27})
160:     ClientSess->>ClientSess: Assign Request ID (e.g., 1)
161:     ClientSess->>ClientSess: Store 'waiter' for ID 1
162:     ClientSess->>+ServerSess: Send CallToolRequest (ID=1, method="tools/call", params={...})
163:     ServerSess->>ServerSess: Receive request ID=1
164:     ServerSess->>+ServerTool: Dispatch request to tool handler
165:     ServerTool-->>-ServerSess: Return result (e.g., 42)
166:     ServerSess->>-ClientSess: Send CallToolResult (ID=1, result={content: [{"type": "text", "text": "42"}]})
167:     ClientSess->>ClientSess: Receive response ID=1
168:     ClientSess->>ClientSess: Match ID=1 to 'waiter'
169:     ClientSess-->>-ClientApp: Return result (CallToolResult object)
170: ```
171: 
172: This flow highlights how the session objects act as intermediaries, managing IDs and matching responses back to their original requests.
173: 
174: ## Diving into the Code (Briefly!)
175: 
176: You typically won't call these methods directly when using `FastMCP` for servers, but seeing the structure helps understand the session's role. These snippets are heavily simplified.
177: 
178: **Base Class (`shared/session.py`):**
179: 
180: Both `ClientSession` and `ServerSession` inherit from `BaseSession`, which contains the core logic for sending/receiving and request/response matching.
181: 
182: ```python
183: # Simplified from shared/session.py
184: import anyio
185: from mcp.types import JSONRPCRequest, JSONRPCResponse, JSONRPCError, ErrorData
186: 
187: class BaseSession:
188:     def __init__(self, read_stream, write_stream, ...):
189:         self._read_stream = read_stream
190:         self._write_stream = write_stream
191:         self._response_streams = {} # Stores 'waiters' for responses, keyed by request ID
192:         self._request_id_counter = 0
193:         # ... other setup ...
194: 
195:     async def send_request(self, request, result_type):
196:         # 1. Get a new unique ID
197:         request_id = self._request_id_counter
198:         self._request_id_counter += 1
199: 
200:         # 2. Create a 'waiter' (memory stream) to receive the response
201:         response_receiver, response_sender = anyio.create_memory_object_stream(1)
202:         self._response_streams[request_id] = response_sender
203: 
204:         # 3. Format the request with the ID
205:         jsonrpc_request = JSONRPCRequest(id=request_id, **request.model_dump())
206: 
207:         # 4. Send it over the write stream
208:         await self._write_stream.send(JSONRPCMessage(jsonrpc_request))
209: 
210:         # 5. Wait for the response to arrive on the 'waiter' stream
211:         response_or_error = await response_receiver.receive() # Timeout logic omitted
212: 
213:         # 6. Process response/error and return result
214:         if isinstance(response_or_error, JSONRPCError):
215:             raise McpError(response_or_error.error)
216:         else:
217:             return result_type.model_validate(response_or_error.result)
218: 
219:     async def _receive_loop(self):
220:         # Runs in the background, reading from the read_stream
221:         async for message in self._read_stream:
222:             if isinstance(message.root, (JSONRPCResponse, JSONRPCError)):
223:                 # It's a response or error for a request we sent
224:                 request_id = message.root.id
225:                 # Find the matching 'waiter' stream
226:                 response_sender = self._response_streams.pop(request_id, None)
227:                 if response_sender:
228:                     # Send the response back to the waiting send_request call
229:                     await response_sender.send(message.root)
230:                 else:
231:                     print(f"Warning: Received response for unknown request ID {request_id}")
232:             elif isinstance(message.root, JSONRPCRequest):
233:                 # It's a new request *from* the other side
234:                 # Subclasses (Client/ServerSession) handle this differently
235:                 await self._handle_incoming_request(message.root)
236:             elif isinstance(message.root, JSONRPCNotification):
237:                  # It's a notification *from* the other side
238:                  await self._handle_incoming_notification(message.root)
239: ```
240: 
241: This shows the core `send_request` logic (assign ID, store waiter, send, wait) and the `_receive_loop` logic (read message, if response -> find waiter, if request/notification -> handle).
242: 
243: **Server Session (`server/session.py`):**
244: 
245: Adds server-specific logic, like handling the `initialize` request and sending server-to-client notifications.
246: 
247: ```python
248: # Simplified from server/session.py
249: from mcp.types import InitializeRequest, InitializeResult, InitializedNotification
250: 
251: class ServerSession(BaseSession):
252:     # ... (init with server info, capabilities) ...
253:     _initialization_state = InitializationState.NotInitialized
254:     _client_params = None # Stores client info after initialization
255: 
256:     async def _handle_incoming_request(self, request: JSONRPCRequest):
257:         # Server specifically handles 'initialize' request first
258:         if request.method == "initialize":
259:             # ... (validate request, store client capabilities in self._client_params) ...
260:             self._initialization_state = InitializationState.Initializing
261:             init_result = InitializeResult(...) # Build result with server info
262:             # Respond directly using the base class's internal send method
263:             await self._send_response(request.id, ServerResult(init_result))
264:         elif self._initialization_state == InitializationState.Initialized:
265:             # For other requests, pass them to the main server logic
266:             # (e.g., to FastMCP's request router) via an internal queue
267:             await self._pass_request_to_server_handler(request)
268:         else:
269:             # Error: Request received before initialization complete
270:             error = ErrorData(code=..., message="Server not initialized")
271:             await self._send_response(request.id, error)
272: 
273:     async def _handle_incoming_notification(self, notification: JSONRPCNotification):
274:         if notification.method == "initialized":
275:              self._initialization_state = InitializationState.Initialized
276:              print("ServerSession: Client initialization complete.")
277:         elif self._initialization_state == InitializationState.Initialized:
278:             # Pass other notifications to server logic if needed
279:             pass
280:         else:
281:              # Ignore notifications before initialized, or log warning
282:              pass
283: 
284:     async def send_log_message(self, level, data, logger=None):
285:         # Helper method to send a specific notification type
286:         log_notification = LoggingMessageNotification(...)
287:         await self.send_notification(ServerNotification(log_notification))
288: 
289:     # ... other methods like send_progress_notification, send_resource_updated ...
290: ```
291: 
292: This highlights how `ServerSession` intercepts the `initialize` request and the `initialized` notification to manage the connection state before passing other messages to the main server logic.
293: 
294: ## Conclusion
295: 
296: You've now explored `ClientSession` and `ServerSession`, the dedicated operators managing individual communication lines between MCP clients and servers.
297: 
298: *   A **Session** handles the lifecycle of a single connection.
299: *   It manages the **initialization handshake**.
300: *   It reliably **sends and receives** messages (requests, responses, notifications).
301: *   Crucially, it **matches incoming responses to outgoing requests** using unique IDs.
302: *   **`ClientSession`** is used by clients to initiate connections and send requests *to* servers.
303: *   **`ServerSession`** is used by servers to handle connections and respond *to* clients.
304: *   Frameworks like **`FastMCP` manage `ServerSession` automatically** for you; interaction often happens indirectly via the `Context` object.
305: 
306: Sessions provide the robust foundation for the request-response patterns and asynchronous notifications that make MCP communication work.
307: 
308: In the final chapter of this foundational series, we'll look at the different ways these sessions can actually transmit their messages back and forth: the various [Chapter 9: Communication Transports (Stdio, SSE, WebSocket, Memory)](09_communication_transports__stdio__sse__websocket__memory_.md).

  8: # Chapter 9: Communication Transports (Stdio, SSE, WebSocket, Memory)
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the final chapter of our introductory journey into the `MCP Python SDK`! In [Chapter 8: Client/Server Sessions (`ClientSession`, `ServerSession`)](08_client_server_sessions___clientsession____serversession__.md), we learned how `Session` objects manage the ongoing conversation and state for a single connection between a client and a server, like dedicated phone operators handling a call.
 11: 
 12: But how do the messages actually *travel* over that phone line? If the client and server are different programs, possibly on different computers, what's the physical wire or digital equivalent carrying the signals?
 13: 
 14: Imagine our standardized MCP messages ([Chapter 7: MCP Protocol Types](07_mcp_protocol_types.md)) are like perfectly formatted letters. We need a delivery service to actually move these letters between the sender and receiver. This is where **Communication Transports** come in.
 15: 
 16: ## What are Communication Transports? The Delivery Service
 17: 
 18: Communication Transports define the **actual mechanisms** used to send the serialized MCP messages (those structured JSON strings) back and forth between the client and server processes.
 19: 
 20: Think of them as different **delivery services** you can choose from:
 21: 
 22: 1.  **`stdio` (Standard Input/Output): Postal Mail for Processes**
 23:     *   **Mechanism:** Uses the standard input (`stdin`) and standard output (`stdout`) streams of the processes. One process writes messages (as lines of text) to its `stdout`, and the other reads them from its `stdin`.
 24:     *   **Use Case:** Very common for command-line tools or when one process directly starts another (like when `mcp run` executes your server script). It's simple and works well when the client and server are running on the same machine and have a parent-child relationship.
 25: 
 26: 2.  **`sse` (Server-Sent Events): One-Way Radio Broadcast (Server -> Client)**
 27:     *   **Mechanism:** Uses standard web protocols (HTTP). The client makes an initial HTTP request, and the server keeps the connection open, sending messages (events) *to* the client whenever it wants. Client-to-server communication usually happens via separate HTTP POST requests.
 28:     *   **Use Case:** Good for web applications where the server needs to push updates (like notifications, progress) to the client (a web browser) efficiently.
 29: 
 30: 3.  **`websocket`: Dedicated Two-Way Phone Line (Web)**
 31:     *   **Mechanism:** Uses the WebSocket protocol, which provides a persistent, full-duplex (two-way) communication channel over a single TCP connection, typically initiated via an HTTP handshake.
 32:     *   **Use Case:** Ideal for highly interactive web applications (like chat apps, real-time dashboards, or the MCP Inspector) where both the client and server need to send messages to each other at any time with low latency.
 33: 
 34: 4.  **`memory`: Internal Office Courier**
 35:     *   **Mechanism:** Uses in-memory queues within a *single* Python process. Messages are passed directly between the client and server components without going through external pipes or network connections.
 36:     *   **Use Case:** Primarily used for **testing**. It allows you to run both the client and server parts of your code in the same test script and have them communicate directly, making tests faster and self-contained.
 37: 
 38: These transports are the concrete implementations that bridge the gap between the abstract `Session` objects (which manage the *conversation*) and the physical reality of sending bytes (the *delivery*).
 39: 
 40: ## How Transports are Used (Often Indirectly)
 41: 
 42: The good news is that if you're using `FastMCP` ([Chapter 2](02_fastmcp_server___fastmcp__.md)) and the `mcp` command-line tool ([Chapter 1](01_cli___mcp__command_.md)), you often **don't need to worry about explicitly choosing or configuring the transport**. The tools handle it for common scenarios:
 43: 
 44: *   **`mcp run your_server.py`**: By default, this command uses the **`stdio`** transport. It starts your Python script as a child process and communicates with it using `stdin` and `stdout`.
 45: *   **`mcp dev your_server.py`**: This command also typically runs your server using **`stdio`**. The *MCP Inspector* web application it launches then connects to your server (potentially via a WebSocket proxy managed by the dev tool) to monitor the `stdio` communication.
 46: *   **`mcp install ...` (for Claude Desktop)**: This usually configures Claude to launch your server using `uv run ... mcp run your_server.py`, again defaulting to **`stdio`** communication between Claude and your server process.
 47: 
 48: So, for many typical development and integration tasks, `stdio` is the default and works behind the scenes.
 49: 
 50: ## Using Transports Programmatically (A Glimpse)
 51: 
 52: While `mcp run` handles `stdio` automatically, what if you wanted to build a *custom* server application that listens over WebSockets? Or write tests using the `memory` transport? The SDK provides tools for this.
 53: 
 54: You typically use an `async context manager` provided by the SDK for the specific transport. These managers handle setting up the communication channel and yield a pair of streams (`read_stream`, `write_stream`) that the `ClientSession` or `ServerSession` can use.
 55: 
 56: **Conceptual Server using Stdio (like `mcp run`)**
 57: 
 58: ```python
 59: # Conceptual code showing how stdio_server might be used
 60: import anyio
 61: from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server # Import the stdio transport
 62: from mcp.server.mcp_server import MCPServer # Low-level server
 63: 
 64: # Assume 'my_actual_server' is your MCPServer instance
 65: my_actual_server = MCPServer(name="MyStdioServer")
 66: 
 67: async def main():
 68:     print("Server: Waiting for client over stdio...")
 69:     # 1. Use the stdio_server context manager
 70:     async with stdio_server() as (read_stream, write_stream):
 71:         # 2. It yields streams connected to stdin/stdout
 72:         print("Server: Stdio streams acquired. Running server logic.")
 73:         # 3. Pass streams to the server's run method
 74:         await my_actual_server.run(
 75:             read_stream,
 76:             write_stream,
 77:             my_actual_server.create_initialization_options()
 78:         )
 79:     print("Server: Stdio streams closed.")
 80: 
 81: if __name__ == "__main__":
 82:     try:
 83:         anyio.run(main)
 84:     except KeyboardInterrupt:
 85:         print("Server: Exiting.")
 86: ```
 87: 
 88: **Explanation:**
 89: The `stdio_server()` context manager handles wrapping the process's standard input and output. It provides the `read_stream` (to get messages *from* stdin) and `write_stream` (to send messages *to* stdout) that the underlying `MCPServer` (and thus `FastMCP`) needs to communicate.
 90: 
 91: **Conceptual Server using WebSocket (within a web framework)**
 92: 
 93: ```python
 94: # Conceptual code using Starlette web framework
 95: from starlette.applications import Starlette
 96: from starlette.routing import WebSocketRoute
 97: from starlette.websockets import WebSocket
 98: from mcp.server.websocket import websocket_server # Import WS transport
 99: from mcp.server.mcp_server import MCPServer # Low-level server
100: 
101: my_actual_server = MCPServer(name="MyWebSocketServer")
102: 
103: # Define the WebSocket endpoint handler
104: async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
105:     # 1. Use the websocket_server context manager
106:     async with websocket_server(
107:         websocket.scope, websocket.receive, websocket.send
108:     ) as (read_stream, write_stream):
109:         # 2. It yields streams connected to this specific WebSocket
110:         print(f"Server: WebSocket client connected. Running server logic.")
111:         # 3. Pass streams to the server's run method
112:         await my_actual_server.run(
113:             read_stream,
114:             write_stream,
115:             my_actual_server.create_initialization_options()
116:         )
117:     print("Server: WebSocket client disconnected.")
118: 
119: # Set up the web application routes
120: routes = [
121:     WebSocketRoute("/mcp", endpoint=websocket_endpoint)
122: ]
123: app = Starlette(routes=routes)
124: 
125: # To run this, you'd use an ASGI server like uvicorn:
126: # uvicorn your_module:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
127: ```
128: 
129: **Explanation:**
130: Here, `websocket_server()` adapts the WebSocket connection provided by the web framework (Starlette) into the `read_stream` and `write_stream` expected by the MCP server. Each connecting client gets its own session handled through this endpoint.
131: 
132: **Conceptual Test using Memory Transport**
133: 
134: ```python
135: import anyio
136: import pytest # Using pytest testing framework
137: from mcp.client.session import ClientSession
138: from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP # Using FastMCP for the server part
139: from mcp.shared.memory import create_client_server_memory_streams
140: 
141: # Define a simple FastMCP server for the test
142: test_server = FastMCP(name="TestServer")
143: @test_server.tool()
144: def ping() -> str:
145:     return "pong"
146: 
147: @pytest.mark.anyio # Mark test to be run with anyio
148: async def test_memory_transport():
149:     # 1. Use the memory stream generator
150:     async with create_client_server_memory_streams() as (
151:         (client_read, client_write), # Client perspective
152:         (server_read, server_write)  # Server perspective
153:     ):
154:         print("Test: Memory streams created.")
155:         # Run server and client concurrently
156:         async with anyio.create_task_group() as tg:
157:             # 2. Start the server using its streams
158:             tg.start_soon(
159:                 test_server.run, server_read, server_write,
160:                 test_server.create_initialization_options()
161:             )
162:             print("Test: Server started in background task.")
163: 
164:             # 3. Create and run client using its streams
165:             async with ClientSession(client_read, client_write) as client:
166:                 print("Test: Client session created. Initializing...")
167:                 await client.initialize()
168:                 print("Test: Client initialized. Calling 'ping' tool...")
169:                 result = await client.call_tool("ping")
170:                 print(f"Test: Client received result: {result}")
171:                 # Assert the result is correct
172:                 assert result.content[0].text == "pong"
173: 
174:             # Cancel server task when client is done (optional)
175:             tg.cancel_scope.cancel()
176:         print("Test: Finished.")
177: 
178: ```
179: 
180: **Explanation:**
181: `create_client_server_memory_streams()` creates pairs of connected in-memory queues. The server writes to `server_write`, which sends messages to `client_read`. The client writes to `client_write`, which sends messages to `server_read`. This allows direct, in-process communication for testing without actual pipes or network sockets.
182: 
183: ## How Transports Work Under the Hood (Stdio Example)
184: 
185: Let's focus on the simplest case: `stdio`. How does the `stdio_server` context manager actually work?
186: 
187: 1.  **Process Startup:** When you run `mcp run your_server.py`, the `mcp` command starts your `your_server.py` script as a new process. The operating system connects the `stdout` of your server process to the `stdin` of the `mcp` process (or vice versa, depending on perspective, but essentially creating pipes between them).
188: 2.  **Context Manager:** Inside your server script (when it calls `stdio_server()`), the context manager gets asynchronous wrappers around the process's standard input (`sys.stdin.buffer`) and standard output (`sys.stdout.buffer`), ensuring they handle text encoding (like UTF-8) correctly.
189: 3.  **Internal Streams:** The context manager also creates internal `anyio` memory streams: `read_stream_writer` / `read_stream` and `write_stream_reader` / `write_stream`. It yields `read_stream` and `write_stream` to your server code.
190: 4.  **Reader Task (`stdin_reader`)**: The context manager starts a background task that continuously reads lines from the process's actual `stdin`.
191:     *   For each line received:
192:         *   It tries to parse the line as a JSON string.
193:         *   It validates the JSON against the `JSONRPCMessage` Pydantic model ([Chapter 7](07_mcp_protocol_types.md)).
194:         *   If valid, it puts the `JSONRPCMessage` object onto the `read_stream_writer` (which sends it to the `read_stream` your server is listening on).
195:         *   If invalid, it might send an `Exception` object instead.
196: 5.  **Writer Task (`stdout_writer`)**: It starts another background task that continuously reads `JSONRPCMessage` objects from the `write_stream_reader` (which receives messages your server sends to the `write_stream`).
197:     *   For each message received:
198:         *   It serializes the `JSONRPCMessage` object back into a JSON string.
199:         *   It adds a newline character (`\n`) because `stdio` communication is typically line-based.
200:         *   It writes the resulting string to the process's actual `stdout`.
201: 6.  **Server Interaction:** Your `MCPServer` (or `FastMCP`) interacts *only* with the yielded `read_stream` and `write_stream`. It doesn't know about `stdin` or `stdout` directly. The transport handles the translation between these memory streams and the actual process I/O.
202: 7.  **Cleanup:** When the `async with stdio_server()...` block finishes, the background reader/writer tasks are stopped, and the streams are closed.
203: 
204: **Simplified Sequence Diagram (Stdio Transport during `callTool`)**
205: 
206: ```mermaid
207: sequenceDiagram
208:     participant ClientProc as Client Process (e.g., mcp CLI)
209:     participant ClientStdio as Stdio Client Transport
210:     participant ClientSess as ClientSession
211:     participant ServerSess as ServerSession
212:     participant ServerStdio as Stdio Server Transport
213:     participant ServerProc as Server Process (your_server.py)
214: 
215:     Note over ClientProc, ServerProc: OS connects pipes (stdout -> stdin)
216: 
217:     ClientSess->>+ClientStdio: Send CallToolRequest via write_stream

220:     ServerProc->>+ServerStdio: Reader task reads JSON line from stdin pipe
221:     ServerStdio->>ServerStdio: Parse & validate JSONRPCMessage
222:     ServerStdio->>-ServerSess: Send message via read_stream_writer
223: 
224:     Note over ServerSess: Server processes request...
225: 
226:     ServerSess->>+ServerStdio: Send CallToolResult via write_stream
227:     ServerStdio->>ServerStdio: Writer task reads from write_stream
228:     ServerStdio->>+ServerProc: Serialize & write JSON line to stdout pipe
229:     ClientProc->>+ClientStdio: Reader task reads JSON line from stdin pipe
230:     ClientStdio->>ClientStdio: Parse & validate JSONRPCMessage
231:     ClientStdio->>-ClientSess: Send message via read_stream_writer
232: ```
233: 
234: This shows how the transport layers (`ClientStdio`, `ServerStdio`) act as intermediaries, translating between the Session's memory streams and the actual process I/O pipes (`stdin`/`stdout`). The other transports (SSE, WebSocket, Memory) perform analogous translation tasks for their respective communication mechanisms.
235: 
236: ## Diving into the Code (Briefly!)
237: 
238: Let's look at the structure inside the transport files.
239: 
240: **`server/stdio.py` (Simplified `stdio_server`)**

273:                     await stdout.write(json_str + "\n")
274:                     await stdout.flush()

307: These snippets illustrate the pattern: set up the external communication (or fake it with memory streams), create internal memory streams for the Session, start background tasks to bridge the two, and yield the internal streams.

309: ## Conclusion
310: 
311: Congratulations on reaching the end of this introductory series! You've learned about Communication Transports – the crucial delivery services that move MCP messages between clients and servers.
312: 
313: *   Transports are the **mechanisms** for sending/receiving serialized messages (e.g., `stdio`, `sse`, `websocket`, `memory`).
314: *   Each transport suits different scenarios (command-line, web, testing).
315: *   Frameworks like `FastMCP` and tools like `mcp run` often handle the **default transport (`stdio`) automatically**.
316: *   Transports work by **bridging** the gap between the `Session`'s internal communication streams and the actual external I/O (pipes, sockets, queues).
317: 
318: Understanding transports completes the picture of how MCP components fit together, from high-level abstractions like `FastMCP` down to the way messages are physically exchanged.
319: 
320: You now have a solid foundation in the core concepts of the `MCP Python SDK`. From here, you can delve deeper into specific features, explore more complex examples, or start building your own powerful AI tools and integrations! Good luck!

  8: # Chapter 1: ndarray (N-dimensional array)
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the NumPy Core tutorial! If you're interested in how NumPy works under the hood, you're in the right place. NumPy is the foundation for scientific computing in Python, and its core strength comes from a special object called the `ndarray`.
 11: 
 12: Imagine you have a huge list of numbers, maybe temperatures recorded every second for a year, or the pixel values of a large image. Doing math with standard Python lists can be quite slow for these large datasets. This is the problem NumPy, and specifically the `ndarray`, is designed to solve.
 13: 
 14: ## What is an ndarray?
 15: 
 16: Think of an `ndarray` (which stands for N-dimensional array) as a powerful grid or table designed to hold items **of the same type**, usually numbers (like integers or decimals). It's the fundamental building block of NumPy.
 17: 
 18: *   **Grid:** It can be a simple list (1-dimension), a table with rows and columns (2-dimensions), or even have more dimensions (3D, 4D, ... N-D).
 19: *   **Same Type:** This is key! Unlike Python lists that can hold anything (numbers, strings, objects), NumPy arrays require all elements to be of the *same data type* (e.g., all 32-bit integers or all 64-bit floating-point numbers). This restriction allows NumPy to store and operate on the data extremely efficiently. We'll explore data types more in [Chapter 2: dtype (Data Type Object)](02_dtype__data_type_object_.md).
 20: 
 21: Analogy: Think of a Python list as a drawer where you can throw anything in – socks, books, tools. An `ndarray` is like a specialized toolbox or an egg carton – designed to hold only specific things (only tools, only eggs) in an organized way. This organization makes it much faster to work with.
 22: 
 23: Here's a quick peek at what different dimensional arrays look like conceptually:

 69: ## Why ndarrays? The Magic of Vectorization
 70: 
 71: Let's say you have two lists of numbers and you want to add them element by element. In standard Python, you'd use a loop:
 72: 
 73: ```python
 74: # Using standard Python lists
 75: list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 76: list2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]
 77: result = []
 78: for i in range(len(list1)):
 79:   result.append(list1[i] + list2[i])
 80: 
 81: print(result)
 82: # Output: [6, 8, 10, 12]
 83: ```
 84: This works, but for millions of numbers, this Python loop becomes slow.
 85: 
 86: Now, see how you do it with NumPy ndarrays:
 87: 
 88: ```python
 89: import numpy as np # Standard way to import NumPy
 90: 
 91: array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
 92: array2 = np.array([5, 6, 7, 8])
 93: 
 94: # Add the arrays directly!
 95: result_array = array1 + array2
 96: 
 97: print(result_array)
 98: # Output: [ 6  8 10 12]
 99: ```
100: Notice how we just used `+` directly on the arrays? This is called **vectorization**. You write the operation as if you're working on single values, but NumPy applies it to *all* elements automatically.
101: 
102: **Why is this better?**
103: 
104: 1.  **Speed:** The looping happens behind the scenes in highly optimized C code, which is *much* faster than a Python loop.
105: 2.  **Readability:** The code is cleaner and looks more like standard mathematical notation.
106: 
107: This ability to perform operations on entire arrays at once is a core reason why NumPy is so powerful and widely used.
108: 
109: ## Creating Your First ndarrays
110: 
111: Let's create some arrays. First, we always import NumPy, usually as `np`:
112: 
113: ```python
114: import numpy as np
115: ```
116: 
117: **1. From Python Lists:** The most common way is using `np.array()`:
118: 
119: ```python
120: # Create a 1-dimensional array (vector)
121: my_list = [10, 20, 30]
122: arr1d = np.array(my_list)
123: print(arr1d)
124: # Output: [10 20 30]
125: 
126: # Create a 2-dimensional array (matrix/table)
127: my_nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
128: arr2d = np.array(my_nested_list)
129: print(arr2d)
130: # Output:
131: # [[1 2 3]
132: #  [4 5 6]]
133: ```
134: `np.array()` takes your list (or list of lists) and converts it into an ndarray. NumPy tries to figure out the best data type automatically.
135: 
136: **2. Arrays of Zeros or Ones:** Often useful as placeholders.
137: 
138: ```python
139: # Create an array of shape (2, 3) filled with zeros
140: zeros_arr = np.zeros((2, 3))
141: print(zeros_arr)
142: # Output:
143: # [[0. 0. 0.]
144: #  [0. 0. 0.]]
145: 
146: # Create an array of shape (3,) filled with ones
147: ones_arr = np.ones(3)
148: print(ones_arr)
149: # Output: [1. 1. 1.]
150: ```
151: Notice we pass a tuple like `(2, 3)` to specify the desired shape. By default, these are filled with floating-point numbers.
152: 
153: **3. Using `np.arange`:** Similar to Python's `range`.
154: 
155: ```python
156: # Create an array with numbers from 0 up to (but not including) 5
157: range_arr = np.arange(5)
158: print(range_arr)
159: # Output: [0 1 2 3 4]
160: ```
161: 
162: There are many other ways to create arrays, but these are fundamental.
163: 
164: ## Exploring Your ndarray: Basic Attributes
165: 
166: Once you have an array, you can easily check its properties:
167: 
168: ```python
169: arr = np.array([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])
170: 
171: # 1. Shape: The size of each dimension
172: print(f"Shape: {arr.shape}")
173: # Output: Shape: (2, 3)  (2 rows, 3 columns)
174: 
175: # 2. Number of Dimensions (ndim): How many axes it has
176: print(f"Dimensions: {arr.ndim}")
177: # Output: Dimensions: 2
178: 
179: # 3. Size: Total number of elements
180: print(f"Size: {arr.size}")
181: # Output: Size: 6
182: 
183: # 4. Data Type (dtype): The type of elements in the array
184: print(f"Data Type: {arr.dtype}")
185: # Output: Data Type: float64
186: ```
187: These attributes are crucial for understanding the structure of your data. The `dtype` tells you what kind of data is stored (e.g., `int32`, `float64`, `bool`). We'll dive much deeper into this in [Chapter 2: dtype (Data Type Object)](02_dtype__data_type_object_.md).
188: 
189: ## A Glimpse Under the Hood
190: 
191: So, how does NumPy achieve its speed? The `ndarray` you manipulate in Python is actually a clever wrapper around a highly efficient data structure implemented in the **C programming language**.
192: 
193: When you perform an operation like `array1 + array2`, Python doesn't slowly loop through the elements. Instead, NumPy:
194: 
195: 1.  Checks if the operation is valid (e.g., arrays are compatible).
196: 2.  Hands off the arrays and the operation (`+` in this case) to its underlying C code.
197: 3.  The C code, which is pre-compiled and highly optimized for your processor, performs the addition very rapidly across the entire block of memory holding the array data.
198: 4.  The result (another block of memory) is then wrapped back into a new Python `ndarray` object for you to use.
199: 
200: Here's a simplified view of what happens when you call `np.array()`:
201: 
202: ```mermaid
203: sequenceDiagram
204:     participant P as Python Code (Your script)
205:     participant NPF as NumPy Python Function (e.g., np.array)
206:     participant CF as C Function (in _multiarray_umath)
207:     participant M as Memory
208: 
209:     P->>NPF: np.array([1, 2, 3])
210:     NPF->>CF: Call C implementation with list data
211:     CF->>M: Allocate contiguous memory block
212:     CF->>M: Copy data [1, 2, 3] into block
213:     CF-->>NPF: Return C-level ndarray structure pointing to memory
214:     NPF-->>P: Return Python ndarray object wrapping the C structure
215: ```
216: 
217: The core implementation lives within compiled C extension modules, primarily `_multiarray_umath`. Python files like `numpy/core/multiarray.py` and `numpy/core/numeric.py` provide the convenient Python functions (`np.array`, `np.zeros`, etc.) that eventually call this fast C code. You can see how `numeric.py` imports functions from `multiarray`:
218: 
219: ```python
220: # From numpy/core/numeric.py - Simplified
221: from . import multiarray
222: from .multiarray import (
223:     arange, array, asarray, asanyarray, # <-- Python functions defined here
224:     empty, empty_like, zeros # <-- More functions
225:     # ... many others ...
226: )
227: 
228: # The `array` function seen in multiarray.py is often a wrapper
229: # that calls the actual C implementation.
230: ```
231: This setup gives you the ease of Python with the speed of C. The `ndarray` object itself stores metadata (like shape, dtype, strides) and a pointer to the actual raw data block in memory. We will see more details about the Python modules involved in [Chapter 6: multiarray Module](06_multiarray_module.md) and [Chapter 7: umath Module](07_umath_module.md).
232: 
233: ## Conclusion
234: 
235: You've met the `ndarray`, the heart of NumPy! You learned:
236: 
237: *   It's a powerful, efficient grid for storing elements of the **same type**.
238: *   It enables **vectorization**, allowing fast operations on entire arrays without explicit Python loops.
239: *   How to create basic arrays using `np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, and `np.arange`.
240: *   How to check key properties like `shape`, `ndim`, `size`, and `dtype`.
241: *   That the speed comes from an underlying **C implementation**.
242: 
243: The `ndarray` is the container. Now, let's look more closely at *what* it contains – the different types of data it can hold.

  8: # Chapter 2: dtype (Data Type Object)
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: ndarray (N-dimensional array)](01_ndarray__n_dimensional_array_.md), we learned that NumPy's `ndarray` is a powerful grid designed to hold items **of the same type**. This "same type" requirement is fundamental to NumPy's speed and efficiency. But how does NumPy know *what kind* of data it's storing? That's where the `dtype` comes in!
 11: 
 12: ## What Problem Does `dtype` Solve?
 13: 
 14: Imagine you have a list of numbers in Python: `[1, 2, 3]`. Are these small integers? Big integers? Numbers with decimal points? Python figures this out on the fly, which is flexible but can be slow for large datasets.
 15: 
 16: NumPy needs to be much faster. To achieve speed, it needs to know *exactly* what kind of data is in an array *before* doing any calculations. Is it a tiny integer that fits in 1 byte? A standard integer using 4 bytes? A decimal number needing 8 bytes?
 17: 
 18: Knowing the exact type and size allows NumPy to:
 19: 1.  **Allocate Memory Efficiently:** If you have a million small integers, NumPy can reserve exactly the right amount of memory, not wasting space.
 20: 2.  **Perform Fast Math:** NumPy can use highly optimized, low-level C or Fortran code that works directly with specific number types (like 32-bit integers or 64-bit floats). These low-level operations are much faster than Python's flexible number handling.
 21: 
 22: Think of it like packing boxes. If you know you're only packing small screws (like `int8`), you can use small, efficiently packed boxes. If you're packing large bolts (`int64`), you need bigger boxes. If you just have a mixed bag (like a Python list), you need a much larger, less efficient container to hold everything. The `dtype` is the label on the box telling NumPy exactly what's inside.
 23: 
 24: ## What is a `dtype` (Data Type Object)?
 25: 
 26: A `dtype` is a special **object** in NumPy that describes the **type** and **size** of data stored in an `ndarray`. Every `ndarray` has a `dtype` associated with it.
 27: 
 28: It's like specifying the "column type" in a database or spreadsheet. If you set a column to "Integer", you expect only whole numbers in that column. If you set it to "Decimal", you expect numbers with potential decimal points. Similarly, the `dtype` ensures all elements in a NumPy array are consistent.
 29: 
 30: Let's see it in action. Remember from Chapter 1 how we could check the attributes of an array?
 31: 
 32: ```python
 33: import numpy as np
 34: 
 35: # Create an array of integers
 36: int_array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
 37: print(f"Integer array: {int_array}")
 38: print(f"Data type: {int_array.dtype}")
 39: 
 40: # Create an array of floating-point numbers (decimals)
 41: float_array = np.array([1.0, 2.5, 3.14])
 42: print(f"\nFloat array: {float_array}")
 43: print(f"Data type: {float_array.dtype}")
 44: 
 45: # Create an array of booleans (True/False)
 46: bool_array = np.array([True, False, True])
 47: print(f"\nBoolean array: {bool_array}")
 48: print(f"Data type: {bool_array.dtype}")
 49: ```
 50: 
 51: **Output:**
 52: 
 53: ```
 54: Integer array: [1 2 3]
 55: Data type: int64
 56: 
 57: Float array: [1.   2.5  3.14]
 58: Data type: float64
 59: 
 60: Boolean array: [ True False  True]
 61: Data type: bool
 62: ```
 63: 
 64: Look at the `Data type:` lines.
 65: *   For `int_array`, NumPy chose `int64`. This means each element is a 64-bit signed integer (a whole number that can be positive or negative, stored using 64 bits or 8 bytes). The `64` tells us the size.
 66: *   For `float_array`, NumPy chose `float64`. Each element is a 64-bit floating-point number (a number with a potential decimal point, following the standard IEEE 754 format, stored using 64 bits or 8 bytes).
 67: *   For `bool_array`, NumPy chose `bool`. Each element is a boolean value (True or False), typically stored using 1 byte.
 68: 
 69: The `dtype` object holds this crucial information.
 70: 
 71: ## Specifying the `dtype`
 72: 
 73: NumPy usually makes a good guess about the `dtype` when you create an array from a list. But sometimes you need to be explicit, especially if you want to save memory or ensure a specific precision.
 74: 
 75: You can specify the `dtype` when creating an array using the `dtype` argument:
 76: 
 77: ```python
 78: import numpy as np
 79: 
 80: # Create an array, specifying 32-bit integers
 81: arr_i32 = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.int32)
 82: print(f"Array: {arr_i32}")
 83: print(f"Data type: {arr_i32.dtype}")
 84: print(f"Bytes per element: {arr_i32.itemsize}") # itemsize shows bytes
 85: 
 86: # Create an array, specifying 32-bit floats
 87: arr_f32 = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.float32)
 88: print(f"\nArray: {arr_f32}") # Notice the decimal points now!
 89: print(f"Data type: {arr_f32.dtype}")
 90: print(f"Bytes per element: {arr_f32.itemsize}")
 91: 
 92: # Create an array using string codes for dtype
 93: arr_f64_str = np.array([4, 5, 6], dtype='float64') # Equivalent to np.float64
 94: print(f"\nArray: {arr_f64_str}")
 95: print(f"Data type: {arr_f64_str.dtype}")
 96: print(f"Bytes per element: {arr_f64_str.itemsize}")
 97: ```
 98: 
 99: **Output:**
100: 
101: ```
102: Array: [1 2 3]
103: Data type: int32
104: Bytes per element: 4
105: 
106: Array: [1. 2. 3.]
107: Data type: float32
108: Bytes per element: 4
109: 
110: Array: [4. 5. 6.]
111: Data type: float64
112: Bytes per element: 8
113: ```
114: 
115: Notice a few things:
116: 1.  We used `np.int32` and `np.float32` to explicitly ask for 32-bit types.
117: 2.  The `.itemsize` attribute shows how many *bytes* each element takes. `int32` and `float32` use 4 bytes, while `float64` uses 8 bytes. Choosing `int32` instead of the default `int64` uses half the memory!
118: 3.  You can use string codes like `'float64'` (or `'f8'`) instead of the type object `np.float64`.
119: 
120: ### Common Data Type Codes
121: 
122: NumPy offers various ways to specify dtypes. Here are the most common:
123: 
124: | Type Category      | NumPy Type Objects         | String Codes (Common) | Description                       |
125: | :----------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
126: | **Boolean**        | `np.bool_`                 | `'?'` or `'bool'`     | True / False                      |
127: | **Signed Integer** | `np.int8`, `np.int16`, `np.int32`, `np.int64` | `'i1'`, `'i2'`, `'i4'`, `'i8'` | Whole numbers (positive/negative) |
128: | **Unsigned Int**   | `np.uint8`, `np.uint16`, `np.uint32`, `np.uint64` | `'u1'`, `'u2'`, `'u4'`, `'u8'` | Whole numbers (non-negative)    |
129: | **Floating Point** | `np.float16`, `np.float32`, `np.float64` | `'f2'`, `'f4'`, `'f8'`     | Decimal numbers                   |
130: | **Complex Float**  | `np.complex64`, `np.complex128` | `'c8'`, `'c16'`    | Complex numbers (real+imaginary)  |
131: | **String (Fixed)** | `np.bytes_`                | `'S'` + number        | Fixed-length byte strings         |
132: | **Unicode (Fixed)**| `np.str_`                  | `'U'` + number        | Fixed-length unicode strings      |
133: | **Object**         | `np.object_`               | `'O'`                 | Python objects                    |
134: | **Datetime**       | `np.datetime64`            | `'M8'` + unit         | Date and time values              |
135: | **Timedelta**      | `np.timedelta64`           | `'m8'` + unit         | Time durations                    |
136: 
137: *   The numbers in the string codes (`i4`, `f8`, `u2`) usually represent the number of **bytes**. So `i4` = 4-byte integer (`int32`), `f8` = 8-byte float (`float64`).
138: *   `'S'` and `'U'` often need a number after them (e.g., `'S10'`, `'U25'`) to specify the maximum length of the string.
139: *   `'M8'` and `'m8'` usually have a unit like `[D]` for day or `[s]` for second (e.g., `'M8[D]'`). We'll explore numeric types more in [Chapter 4: Numeric Types (`numerictypes`)](04_numeric_types___numerictypes__.md).
140: 
141: Using explicit dtypes is important when:
142: *   You need to control memory usage (e.g., using `int8` if your numbers are always small).
143: *   You are reading data from a file that has a specific binary format.
144: *   You need a specific precision for calculations.
145: 
146: ## A Glimpse Under the Hood
147: 
148: How does NumPy manage this `dtype` information internally?
149: 
150: The Python `dtype` object you interact with (like `arr.dtype`) is essentially a wrapper around more detailed information stored in a C structure within NumPy's core. This C structure (often referred to as `PyArray_Descr`) contains everything NumPy needs to know to interpret the raw bytes in the `ndarray`'s memory block:
151: 
152: 1.  **Type Kind:** Is it an integer, float, boolean, string, etc.? (Represented by a character like `'i'`, `'f'`, `'b'`, `'S'`).
153: 2.  **Item Size:** How many bytes does one element occupy? (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8).
154: 3.  **Byte Order:** How are multi-byte numbers stored? (Little-endian `<` or Big-endian `>`. Important for reading files created on different types of computers).
155: 4.  **Element Type:** A pointer to the specific C-level functions that know how to operate on this data type.
156: 5.  **Fields (for Structured Types):** If it's a structured dtype (like a C struct or a database row), information about the names, dtypes, and offsets of each field.
157: 6.  **Subarray (for Nested Types):** Information if the dtype itself represents an array.
158: 
159: When you create an array or perform an operation:
160: 
161: ```mermaid

169:     P->>NPF: np.array([1, 2], dtype='int32')
170:     NPF->>C_API: Parse dtype string 'int32'
171:     C_API->>DTypeC: Create/Find PyArray_Descr for int32 (kind='i', itemsize=4, etc.)
172:     C_API->>Mem: Allocate memory (2 items * 4 bytes/item = 8 bytes)
173:     C_API->>Mem: Copy data [1, 2] into memory as 32-bit ints
174:     C_API-->>NPF: Return C ndarray struct (pointing to Mem and DTypeC)
175:     NPF-->>P: Return Python ndarray object wrapping the C struct
176: ```
177: 
178: The `dtype` is created or retrieved *once* and then referenced by potentially many arrays. This C-level description allows NumPy's core functions, especially the [ufunc (Universal Function)](03_ufunc__universal_function_.md)s we'll see next, to work directly on the raw memory with maximum efficiency.
179: 
180: The Python code in `numpy/core/_dtype.py` helps manage the creation and representation (like the nice string output you see when you `print(arr.dtype)`) of these `dtype` objects in Python. For instance, functions like `_kind_name`, `__str__`, and `__repr__` in `_dtype.py` are used to generate the user-friendly names and representations based on the underlying C structure's information. The `_dtype_ctypes.py` file helps bridge the gap between NumPy dtypes and Python's built-in `ctypes` module, allowing interoperability.
181: 
182: ## Beyond Simple Numbers: Structured Data and Byte Order
183: 
184: `dtype`s can do more than just describe simple numbers:
185: 
186: *   **Structured Arrays:** You can define a `dtype` that represents a mix of types, like a row in a table or a C struct. This is useful for representing structured data efficiently.
187:     ```python
188:     # Define a structured dtype: a name (up to 10 chars) and an age (4-byte int)
189:     person_dtype = np.dtype([('name', 'S10'), ('age', 'i4')])
190:     people = np.array([('Alice', 30), ('Bob', 25)], dtype=person_dtype)
191: 
192:     print(people)
193:     print(people.dtype)
194:     print(people[0]['name']) # Access fields by name
195:     ```
196:     **Output:**
197:     ```
198:     [(b'Alice', 30) (b'Bob', 25)]
199:     [('name', 'S10'), ('age', '<i4')]
200:     b'Alice'
201:     ```
202: *   **Byte Order:** Computers can store multi-byte numbers in different ways ("endianness"). `dtype`s can specify byte order (`<` for little-endian, `>` for big-endian) which is crucial for reading binary data correctly across different systems. Notice the `'<i4'` in the output above – the `<` indicates little-endian, which is common on x86 processors.
203: 
204: ## Conclusion
205: 
206: You've now learned about the `dtype` object, the crucial piece of metadata that tells NumPy *what kind* of data is stored in an `ndarray`. You saw:
207: 
208: *   `dtype` describes the **type** and **size** of array elements.
209: *   It's essential for NumPy's **memory efficiency** and **computational speed**.
210: *   How to **inspect** (`arr.dtype`) and **specify** (`dtype=...`) data types using type objects (`np.int32`) or string codes (`'i4'`).
211: *   That the Python `dtype` object represents lower-level C information (`PyArray_Descr`) used for efficient operations.
212: *   `dtype`s can also handle more complex scenarios like **structured data** and **byte order**.
213: 
214: Understanding `dtype`s is key to understanding how NumPy manages data efficiently. With the container (`ndarray`) and its contents (`dtype`) defined, we can now explore how NumPy performs fast calculations on these arrays.
215: 
216: Next up, we'll dive into the workhorses of NumPy's element-wise computations: [Chapter 3: ufunc (Universal Function)](03_ufunc__universal_function_.md).

  8: # Chapter 3: ufunc (Universal Function)
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 1: ndarray (N-dimensional array)](01_ndarray__n_dimensional_array_.md), we met the `ndarray`, NumPy's powerful container for numerical data. In [Chapter 2: dtype (Data Type Object)](02_dtype__data_type_object_.md), we learned how `dtype`s specify the exact *kind* of data stored within those arrays.
 11: 
 12: Now, let's tackle a fundamental question: How does NumPy actually *perform calculations* on these arrays so quickly? If you have two large arrays, `a` and `b`, why is `a + b` massively faster than using a Python `for` loop? The answer lies in a special type of function: the **ufunc**.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Do ufuncs Solve? Speeding Up Element-wise Math
 15: 
 16: Imagine you have temperature readings from a sensor stored in a NumPy array, and you need to convert them from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The formula is `F = C * 9/5 + 32`.
 17: 
 18: With standard Python lists, you'd loop through each temperature:
 19: 
 20: ```python
 21: # Celsius temperatures in a Python list
 22: celsius_list = [0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 100.0]
 23: fahrenheit_list = []
 24: 
 25: # Python loop for conversion
 26: for temp_c in celsius_list:
 27:   temp_f = temp_c * (9/5) + 32
 28:   fahrenheit_list.append(temp_f)
 29: 
 30: print(fahrenheit_list)
 31: # Output: [32.0, 50.0, 68.0, 86.0, 212.0]
 32: ```
 33: This works, but as we saw in Chapter 1, Python loops are relatively slow, especially for millions of data points.
 34: 
 35: NumPy offers a much faster way using its `ndarray` and vectorized operations:
 36: 
 37: ```python
 38: import numpy as np
 39: 
 40: # Celsius temperatures in a NumPy array
 41: celsius_array = np.array([0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 100.0])
 42: 
 43: # NumPy vectorized conversion - NO explicit Python loop!
 44: fahrenheit_array = celsius_array * (9/5) + 32
 45: 
 46: print(fahrenheit_array)
 47: # Output: [ 32.  50.  68.  86. 212.]
 48: ```
 49: Look how clean that is! We just wrote the math formula directly using the array. But *how* does NumPy execute `*`, `/`, and `+` so efficiently on *every element* without a visible loop? This magic is powered by ufuncs.
 50: 
 51: ## What is a ufunc (Universal Function)?
 52: 
 53: A **ufunc** (Universal Function) is a special type of function in NumPy designed to operate on `ndarray`s **element by element**. Think of them as super-powered mathematical functions specifically built for NumPy arrays.
 54: 
 55: Examples include `np.add`, `np.subtract`, `np.multiply`, `np.sin`, `np.cos`, `np.exp`, `np.sqrt`, `np.maximum`, `np.equal`, and many more.
 56: 
 57: **Key Features:**
 58: 
 59: 1.  **Element-wise Operation:** A ufunc applies the same operation independently to each element of the input array(s). When you do `np.add(a, b)`, it conceptually does `result[0] = a[0] + b[0]`, `result[1] = a[1] + b[1]`, and so on for all elements.
 60: 2.  **Speed (Optimized C Loops):** This is the secret sauce! Ufuncs don't actually perform the element-wise operation using slow Python loops. Instead, they execute highly optimized, pre-compiled **C loops** under the hood. This C code can work directly with the raw data buffers of the arrays (remember, ndarrays store data contiguously), making the computations extremely fast.
 61:     *   **Analogy:** Imagine you need to staple 1000 documents. A Python loop is like picking up the stapler, stapling one document, putting the stapler down, picking it up again, stapling the next... A ufunc is like using an industrial stapling machine that processes the entire stack almost instantly.
 62: 3.  **Broadcasting Support:** Ufuncs automatically handle operations between arrays of different, but compatible, shapes. For example, you can add a single number (a scalar) to every element of an array, or add a 1D array to each row of a 2D array. The ufunc "stretches" or "broadcasts" the smaller array to match the shape of the larger one during the calculation. (We won't dive deep into broadcasting rules here, just know that ufuncs enable it).
 63: 4.  **Type Casting:** Ufuncs can intelligently handle inputs with different [Chapter 2: dtype (Data Type Object)](02_dtype__data_type_object_.md)s. For instance, if you add an `int32` array and a `float64` array, the ufunc might decide to convert the integers to `float64` before performing the addition to avoid losing precision, returning a `float64` array. This happens according to well-defined casting rules.
 64: 5.  **Optional Output Arrays (`out` argument):** You can tell a ufunc to place its result into an *existing* array instead of creating a new one. This can save memory, especially when working with very large arrays or inside loops.
 65: 
 66: ## Using ufuncs
 67: 
 68: You use ufuncs just like regular Python functions, but you pass NumPy arrays as arguments. Many common mathematical operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `==`, `<`, etc.) also call ufuncs behind the scenes when used with NumPy arrays.
 69: 
 70: ```python
 71: import numpy as np
 72: 
 73: a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
 74: b = np.array([5, 0, 7, 2])
 75: 
 76: # Using the ufunc directly
 77: c = np.add(a, b)
 78: print(f"np.add(a, b)  = {c}")
 79: # Output: np.add(a, b)  = [ 6  2 10  6]
 80: 
 81: # Using the corresponding operator (which calls np.add internally)
 82: d = a + b
 83: print(f"a + b         = {d}")
 84: # Output: a + b         = [ 6  2 10  6]
 85: 
 86: # Other examples
 87: print(f"np.maximum(a, b) = {np.maximum(a, b)}") # Element-wise maximum
 88: # Output: np.maximum(a, b) = [5 2 7 4]
 89: 
 90: print(f"np.sin(a)      = {np.sin(a)}") # Element-wise sine
 91: # Output: np.sin(a)      = [ 0.84147098  0.90929743  0.14112001 -0.7568025 ]
 92: ```
 93: 
 94: **Using the `out` Argument:**
 95: 
 96: Let's pre-allocate an array and tell the ufunc to use it for the result.
 97: 
 98: ```python
 99: import numpy as np
100: 
101: a = np.arange(5)       # [0 1 2 3 4]
102: b = np.arange(5, 10)   # [5 6 7 8 9]
103: 
104: # Create an empty array with the same shape and type
105: result = np.empty_like(a)
106: 
107: # Perform addition, storing the result in the 'result' array
108: np.add(a, b, out=result)
109: 
110: print(f"a = {a}")
111: print(f"b = {b}")
112: print(f"result (after np.add(a, b, out=result)) = {result}")
113: # Output:
114: # a = [0 1 2 3 4]
115: # b = [5 6 7 8 9]
116: # result (after np.add(a, b, out=result)) = [ 5  7  9 11 13]
117: ```
118: Instead of creating a *new* array for the sum, `np.add` placed the values directly into `result`.
119: 
120: ## A Glimpse Under the Hood
121: 
122: So, what happens internally when you call, say, `np.add(array1, array2)`?
123: 
124: 1.  **Identify Ufunc:** NumPy recognizes `np.add` as a specific ufunc object. This object holds metadata about the operation (like its name, number of inputs/outputs, identity element if any, etc.).
125: 2.  **Check Dtypes:** NumPy inspects the `dtype` of `array1` and `array2` (e.g., `int32`, `float64`). This uses the `dtype` information we learned about in [Chapter 2: dtype (Data Type Object)](02_dtype__data_type_object_.md).
126: 3.  **Find the Loop:** The ufunc object contains an internal table (a list of "loops"). Each loop is a specific, pre-compiled C function designed to handle a particular combination of input/output `dtype`s (e.g., `int32 + int32 -> int32`, `float32 + float32 -> float32`, `int32 + float64 -> float64`). NumPy searches this table to find the most appropriate C function based on the input dtypes and casting rules. It might need to select a loop that involves converting one or both inputs to a common, safer type (type casting).
127: 4.  **Check Broadcasting:** NumPy checks if the shapes of `array1` and `array2` are compatible according to broadcasting rules. If they are compatible but different, it calculates how to "stretch" the smaller array's dimensions virtually.
128: 5.  **Allocate Output:** If the `out` argument wasn't provided, NumPy allocates a new block of memory for the result array, determining its shape (based on broadcasting) and `dtype` (based on the chosen loop).
129: 6.  **Execute C Loop:** NumPy calls the selected C function. This function iterates through the elements of the input arrays (using pointers to their raw memory locations, respecting broadcasting rules) and performs the addition, storing the result in the output array's memory. This loop is *very* fast because it's simple, compiled C code operating on primitive types.
130: 7.  **Return ndarray:** NumPy wraps the output memory block (either the newly allocated one or the one provided via `out`) into a new Python `ndarray` object ([Chapter 1: ndarray (N-dimensional array)](01_ndarray__n_dimensional_array_.md)) with the correct `shape`, `dtype`, etc., and returns it to your Python code.

153: ```
154: 
155: **Where is the Code?**
156: 
157: *   The ufunc objects themselves are typically defined in C, often generated by helper scripts like `numpy/core/code_generators/generate_umath.py`. This script reads definitions (like those in the `defdict` variable within the script) specifying the ufunc's name, inputs, outputs, and the C functions to use for different type combinations.
158:     ```python
159:     # Snippet from generate_umath.py's defdict for 'add'
160:     'add':
161:         Ufunc(2, 1, Zero, # nin=2, nout=1, identity=0
162:               docstrings.get('numpy._core.umath.add'),
163:               'PyUFunc_AdditionTypeResolver', # Function for type resolution
164:               TD('?', cfunc_alias='logical_or', ...), # Loop for bools
165:               TD(no_bool_times_obj, dispatch=[...]), # Loops for numeric types
166:               # ... loops for datetime, object ...
167:               indexed=intfltcmplx # Types supporting indexed access
168:               ),
169:     ```
170: *   The Python functions you call (like `numpy.add`) are often thin wrappers defined in places like `numpy/core/umath.py` or `numpy/core/numeric.py`. These Python functions essentially just retrieve the corresponding C ufunc object and trigger its execution mechanism.
171: *   The core C machinery for handling ufunc dispatch (finding the right loop), broadcasting, and executing the loops resides within the compiled `_multiarray_umath` C extension module. We'll touch upon these modules in [Chapter 6: multiarray Module](06_multiarray_module.md) and [Chapter 7: umath Module](07_umath_module.md).
172: *   Helper Python modules like `numpy/core/_methods.py` provide Python implementations for array methods (like `.sum()`, `.mean()`, `.max()`) which often leverage the underlying ufunc's reduction capabilities.
173: *   Error handling during ufunc execution (e.g., division by zero, invalid operations) can be configured using functions like `seterr` defined in `numpy/core/_ufunc_config.py`, and specific exception types like `UFuncTypeError` from `numpy/core/_exceptions.py` might be raised if things go wrong (e.g., no suitable loop found for the input types).
174: 
175: ## Conclusion
176: 
177: Ufuncs are the powerhouses behind NumPy's speed for element-wise operations. You've learned:
178: 
179: *   They perform operations **element by element** on arrays.
180: *   Their speed comes from executing optimized **C loops**, avoiding slow Python loops.
181: *   They support **broadcasting** (handling compatible shapes) and **type casting** (handling different dtypes).
182: *   You can use them directly (`np.add(a, b)`) or often via operators (`a + b`).
183: *   The `out` argument allows reusing existing arrays, saving memory.
184: *   Internally, NumPy finds the right C loop based on input dtypes, handles broadcasting, executes the loop, and returns a new ndarray.
185: 
186: Now that we understand how basic element-wise operations work, let's delve deeper into the different kinds of numbers NumPy works with.

  8: # Chapter 4: Numeric Types (`numerictypes`)
  9: 
 10: Hello again! In [Chapter 3: ufunc (Universal Function)](03_ufunc__universal_function_.md), we saw how NumPy uses universal functions (`ufuncs`) to perform fast calculations on arrays. We learned that these `ufuncs` operate element by element and can handle different data types using optimized C loops.
 11: 
 12: But what exactly *are* all the different data types that NumPy knows about? We touched on `dtype` objects in [Chapter 2: dtype (Data Type Object)](02_dtype__data_type_object_.md), which *describe* the type of data in an array (like '64-bit integer' or '32-bit float'). Now, we'll look at the actual **types themselves** – the specific building blocks like `numpy.int32`, `numpy.float64`, etc., and how they relate to each other. This collection and classification system is handled within the `numerictypes` concept in NumPy's core.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Do `numerictypes` Solve? Organizing the Data Ingredients
 15: 
 16: Imagine you're organizing a huge pantry. You have different kinds of items: grains, spices, canned goods, etc. Within grains, you have rice, oats, quinoa. Within rice, you might have basmati, jasmine, brown rice.
 17: 
 18: NumPy's data types are similar. It has many specific types of numbers (`int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `float16`, `float32`, `float64`, etc.) and other kinds of data (`bool`, `complex`, `datetime`). Just having a list of all these types isn't very organized.
 19: 
 20: We need a system to:
 21: 1.  **Define** each specific type precisely (e.g., what exactly is `np.int32`?).
 22: 2.  **Group** similar types together (e.g., all integers, all floating-point numbers).
 23: 3.  **Establish relationships** between types (e.g., know that an `int32` *is a kind of* `integer`, which *is a kind of* `number`).
 24: 4.  Provide convenient **shortcuts or aliases** (e.g., maybe `np.double` is just another name for `np.float64`).
 25: 
 26: The `numerictypes` concept in NumPy provides this structured catalog or "family tree" for all its scalar data types. It helps NumPy (and you!) understand how different data types are related, which is crucial for operations like choosing the right `ufunc` loop or deciding the output type of a calculation (type promotion).
 27: 
 28: ## What are Numeric Types (`numerictypes`)?
 29: 
 30: In NumPy, `numerictypes` refers to the collection of **scalar type objects** themselves (like the Python classes `numpy.int32`, `numpy.float64`, `numpy.bool_`) and the **hierarchy** that organizes them.
 31: 
 32: Think back to the `dtype` object from Chapter 2. The `dtype` object *describes* the data type of an array. The actual type it's describing *is* one of these numeric types (or more accurately, a scalar type, since it includes non-numbers like `bool_` and `str_`).
 33: 
 34: ```python
 35: import numpy as np
 36: 
 37: # Create an array of 32-bit integers
 38: arr = np.array([10, 20, 30], dtype=np.int32)
 39: 
 40: # The dtype object describes the type
 41: print(f"Array's dtype object: {arr.dtype}")
 42: # Output: Array's dtype object: int32
 43: 
 44: # The actual Python type of elements (if accessed individually)
 45: # and the type referred to by the dtype object's `.type` attribute
 46: print(f"The element type class: {arr.dtype.type}")
 47: # Output: The element type class: <class 'numpy.int32'>
 48: 
 49: # This <class 'numpy.int32'> is one of NumPy's scalar types
 50: # managed under the numerictypes concept.
 51: ```
 52: 
 53: So, `numerictypes` defines the actual classes like `np.int32`, `np.float64`, `np.integer`, `np.floating`, etc., that form the basis of NumPy's type system.
 54: 
 55: ## The Type Hierarchy: A Family Tree
 56: 
 57: NumPy organizes its scalar types into a hierarchy, much like biological classification (Kingdom > Phylum > Class > Order...). This helps group related types.
 58: 
 59: At the top is `np.generic`, the base class for all NumPy scalars. Below that, major branches include `np.number`, `np.flexible`, `np.bool_`, etc.
 60: 
 61: Here's a simplified view of the *numeric* part of the hierarchy:
 62: 
 63: ```mermaid
 64: graph TD
 65:     N[np.number] --> I[np.integer]
 66:     N --> IX[np.inexact]

101:     class N,I,IX,SI,UI,F,C abstract;
102: ```
103: 
104: *   **Abstract Types:** Boxes like `np.number`, `np.integer`, `np.floating` represent *categories* or abstract base classes. You usually don't create arrays directly of type `np.integer`, but you can use these categories to check if a specific type belongs to that group.
105: *   **Concrete Types:** Boxes like `np.int32`, `np.float64`, `np.complex128` are the specific, concrete types that you typically use to create arrays. They inherit from the abstract types. For example, `np.int32` is a subclass of `np.signedinteger`, which is a subclass of `np.integer`, which is a subclass of `np.number`.
106: 
107: You can check these relationships using `np.issubdtype` or Python's built-in `issubclass`:
108: 
109: ```python
110: import numpy as np
111: 
112: # Is np.int32 a kind of integer?
113: print(f"issubdtype(np.int32, np.integer): {np.issubdtype(np.int32, np.integer)}")
114: # Output: issubdtype(np.int32, np.integer): True
115: 
116: # Is np.float64 a kind of integer?
117: print(f"issubdtype(np.float64, np.integer): {np.issubdtype(np.float64, np.integer)}")
118: # Output: issubdtype(np.float64, np.integer): False
119: 
120: # Is np.float64 a kind of number?
121: print(f"issubdtype(np.float64, np.number): {np.issubdtype(np.float64, np.number)}")
122: # Output: issubdtype(np.float64, np.number): True
123: 
124: # Using issubclass directly on the types also works
125: print(f"issubclass(np.int32, np.integer): {issubclass(np.int32, np.integer)}")
126: # Output: issubclass(np.int32, np.integer): True
127: ```
128: This hierarchy is useful for understanding how NumPy treats different types, especially during calculations where types might need to be promoted (e.g., adding an `int32` and a `float64` usually results in a `float64`).
129: 
130: ## Common Types and Aliases
131: 
132: While NumPy defines many specific types (like `np.int8`, `np.uint16`, `np.float16`), you'll most often encounter these:
133: 
134: *   **Integers:** `np.int32`, `np.int64` (default on 64-bit systems is usually `np.int64`)
135: *   **Unsigned Integers:** `np.uint8` (common for images), `np.uint32`, `np.uint64`
136: *   **Floats:** `np.float32` (single precision), `np.float64` (double precision, usually the default)
137: *   **Complex:** `np.complex64`, `np.complex128`
138: *   **Boolean:** `np.bool_` (True/False)
139: 
140: NumPy also provides several **aliases** or alternative names for convenience or historical reasons. Some common ones:
141: 
142: *   `np.byte` is an alias for `np.int8`
143: *   `np.short` is an alias for `np.int16`
144: *   `np.intc` often corresponds to the C `int` type (usually `np.int32` or `np.int64`)
145: *   `np.int_` is the default integer type (often `np.int64` on 64-bit systems, `np.int32` on 32-bit systems). Platform dependent!
146: *   `np.single` is an alias for `np.float32`
147: *   `np.double` or `np.float_` is an alias for `np.float64` (matches Python's `float`)
148: *   `np.longdouble` corresponds to the C `long double` (size varies by platform)
149: *   `np.csingle` is an alias for `np.complex64`
150: *   `np.cdouble` or `np.complex_` is an alias for `np.complex128` (matches Python's `complex`)
151: 
152: You can usually use the specific name (like `np.float64`) or an alias (like `np.double`) interchangeably when specifying a `dtype`.
153: 
154: ```python
155: import numpy as np
156: 
157: # Using the specific name
158: arr_f64 = np.array([1.0, 2.0], dtype=np.float64)
159: print(f"Type using np.float64: {arr_f64.dtype}")
160: # Output: Type using np.float64: float64
161: 
162: # Using an alias
163: arr_double = np.array([1.0, 2.0], dtype=np.double)
164: print(f"Type using np.double: {arr_double.dtype}")
165: # Output: Type using np.double: float64
166: 
167: # They refer to the same underlying type
168: print(f"Is np.float64 the same as np.double? {np.float64 is np.double}")
169: # Output: Is np.float64 the same as np.double? True
170: ```
171: 
172: ## A Glimpse Under the Hood
173: 
174: How does NumPy define all these types and their relationships? It's mostly done in Python code within the `numpy.core` submodule.
175: 
176: 1.  **Base C Types:** The fundamental types (like a 32-bit integer, a 64-bit float) are ultimately implemented in C as part of the [multiarray Module](06_multiarray_module.md).
177: 2.  **Python Class Definitions:** Python classes are defined for each scalar type (e.g., `class int32(signedinteger): ...`) in modules like `numpy/core/numerictypes.py`. These classes inherit from each other to create the hierarchy (e.g., `int32` inherits from `signedinteger`, which inherits from `integer`, etc.).
178: 3.  **Type Aliases:** Files like `numpy/core/_type_aliases.py` set up dictionaries (`sctypeDict`, `allTypes`) that map various names (including aliases like "double" or "int_") to the actual type objects (like `np.float64` or `np.intp`). This allows you to use different names when creating `dtype` objects.
179: 4.  **Registration:** The Python number types are also registered with Python's abstract base classes (`numbers.Integral`, `numbers.Real`, etc.) in `numerictypes.py` to improve interoperability with standard Python type checking.
180: 5.  **Documentation Generation:** Helper scripts like `numpy/core/_add_newdocs_scalars.py` use the type information and aliases to automatically generate parts of the documentation strings you see when you type `help(np.int32)`, making sure the aliases and platform specifics are correctly listed.
181: 
182: When you use a function like `np.issubdtype(np.int32, np.integer)`:
183: 
184: ```mermaid
185: sequenceDiagram
186:     participant P as Your Python Code
187:     participant NPFunc as np.issubdtype
188:     participant PyTypes as Python Type System
189:     participant TypeHier as NumPy Type Hierarchy (in numerictypes.py)
190: 
191:     P->>NPFunc: np.issubdtype(np.int32, np.integer)
192:     NPFunc->>TypeHier: Get type object for np.int32
193:     NPFunc->>TypeHier: Get type object for np.integer
194:     NPFunc->>PyTypes: Ask: issubclass(np.int32_obj, np.integer_obj)?
195:     PyTypes-->>NPFunc: Return True (based on class inheritance)
196:     NPFunc-->>P: Return True
197: ```
198: 
199: Essentially, `np.issubdtype` leverages Python's standard `issubclass` mechanism, applied to the hierarchy of type classes defined within `numerictypes`. The `_type_aliases.py` file plays a crucial role in making sure that string names or alias names used in `dtype` specifications resolve to the correct underlying type object before such checks happen.
200: 
201: ```python
202: # Simplified view from numpy/core/_type_aliases.py
203: 
204: # ... (definitions of actual types like np.int8, np.float64) ...
205: 
206: allTypes = {
207:     'int8': np.int8,
208:     'int16': np.int16,
209:     # ...
210:     'float64': np.float64,
211:     # ...
212:     'signedinteger': np.signedinteger, # Abstract type
213:     'integer': np.integer,           # Abstract type
214:     'number': np.number,             # Abstract type
215:     # ... etc
216: }
217: 
218: _aliases = {
219:     'double': 'float64', # "double" maps to the key "float64"
220:     'int_': 'intp',      # "int_" maps to the key "intp" (platform dependent type)
221:     # ... etc
222: }
223: 
224: sctypeDict = {} # Dictionary mapping names/aliases to types
225: # Populate sctypeDict using allTypes and _aliases
226: # ... (code to merge these dictionaries) ...
227: 
228: # When you do np.dtype('double'), NumPy uses sctypeDict (or similar logic)
229: # to find that 'double' means np.float64.
230: ```
231: 
232: This setup provides a flexible and organized way to manage NumPy's rich set of data types.
233: 
234: ## Conclusion
235: 
236: You've now explored the world of NumPy's `numerictypes`! You learned:
237: 
238: *   `numerictypes` define the actual scalar **type objects** (like `np.int32`) and their **relationships**.
239: *   They form a **hierarchy** (like a family tree) with abstract categories (e.g., `np.integer`) and concrete types (e.g., `np.int32`).
240: *   This hierarchy helps NumPy understand how types relate, useful for calculations and type checking (`np.issubdtype`).
241: *   NumPy provides many convenient **aliases** (e.g., `np.double` for `np.float64`).
242: *   The types, hierarchy, and aliases are managed within Python code in `numpy.core`, primarily `numerictypes.py` and `_type_aliases.py`.
243: 
244: Understanding this catalog of types helps clarify why NumPy behaves the way it does when mixing different kinds of numbers.
245: 
246: Now that we know about the arrays, their data types, the functions that operate on them, and the specific numeric types available, how does NumPy *show* us the results?
247: 
248: Let's move on to how NumPy displays arrays: [Chapter 5: Array Printing (`arrayprint`)](05_array_printing___arrayprint__.md).

  8: # Chapter 5: Array Printing (`arrayprint`)
  9: 
 10: In the previous chapter, [Chapter 4: Numeric Types (`numerictypes`)](04_numeric_types___numerictypes__.md), we explored the different kinds of data NumPy can store in its arrays, like `int32`, `float64`, and more. Now that we know about the arrays ([`ndarray`](01_ndarray__n_dimensional_array_.md)), their data types ([`dtype`](02_dtype__data_type_object_.md)), the functions that operate on them ([`ufunc`](03_ufunc__universal_function_.md)), and the specific number types (`numerictypes`), a practical question arises: How do we actually *look* at these arrays, especially if they are very large?
 11: 
 12: ## What Problem Does `arrayprint` Solve? Making Arrays Readable
 13: 
 14: Imagine you have a NumPy array representing a large image, maybe with millions of pixel values. Or perhaps you have simulation data with thousands of temperature readings.
 15: 
 16: ```python
 17: import numpy as np
 18: 
 19: # Imagine this is a huge array, maybe thousands of numbers
 20: large_array = np.arange(2000)
 21: 
 22: # If Python just tried to print every single number...
 23: # it would flood your screen and be impossible to read!
 24: # print(list(large_array)) # <-- Don't run this! It would be too long.
 25: ```
 26: 
 27: If NumPy just dumped *all* the numbers onto your screen whenever you tried to display a large array, it would be overwhelming and useless. We need a way to show the array's contents in a concise, human-friendly format. How can we get a *sense* of the array's data without printing every single element?
 28: 
 29: This is the job of NumPy's **array printing** mechanism, often referred to internally by the name of its main Python module, `arrayprint`.
 30: 
 31: ## What is Array Printing (`arrayprint`)?
 32: 
 33: `arrayprint` is NumPy's **"pretty printer"** for `ndarray` objects. It's responsible for converting a NumPy array into a nicely formatted string representation that's easy to read and understand when you display it (e.g., in your Python console, Jupyter notebook, or using the `print()` function).
 34: 
 35: Think of it like getting a summary report instead of the raw database dump. `arrayprint` intelligently decides how to show the array, considering things like:
 36: 
 37: *   **Summarization:** For large arrays, it shows only the beginning and end elements, using ellipsis (`...`) to indicate the omitted parts.
 38: *   **Precision:** It controls how many decimal places are shown for floating-point numbers.
 39: *   **Line Wrapping:** It breaks long rows of data into multiple lines to fit within a certain width.
 40: *   **Special Values:** It uses consistent strings for "Not a Number" (`nan`) and infinity (`inf`).
 41: *   **Customization:** It allows you to change these settings to suit your needs.
 42: 
 43: Let's see it in action with our `large_array`:
 44: 
 45: ```python
 46: import numpy as np
 47: 
 48: large_array = np.arange(2000)
 49: 
 50: # Let NumPy's array printing handle it
 51: print(large_array)
 52: ```
 53: 
 54: **Output:**
 55: 
 56: ```
 57: [   0    1    2 ... 1997 1998 1999]
 58: ```
 59: 
 60: Instead of 2000 numbers flooding the screen, NumPy smartly printed only the first three and the last three, with `...` in between. This gives us a good idea of the array's contents (a sequence starting from 0) without being overwhelming.
 61: 
 62: ## Key Features and Options
 63: 
 64: `arrayprint` has several options you can control to change how arrays are displayed.
 65: 
 66: ### 1. Summarization (`threshold` and `edgeitems`)
 67: 
 68: *   `threshold`: The total number of array elements that triggers summarization. If the array's `size` is greater than `threshold`, the array gets summarized. (Default: 1000)
 69: *   `edgeitems`: When summarizing, this is the number of items shown at the beginning and end of each dimension. (Default: 3)
 70: 
 71: Let's try printing a smaller array and then changing the threshold:
 72: 
 73: ```python
 74: import numpy as np
 75: 
 76: # An array with 10 elements
 77: arr = np.arange(10)
 78: print("Original:")
 79: print(arr)
 80: 
 81: # Temporarily set the threshold lower (e.g., 5)
 82: # We use np.printoptions as a context manager for temporary settings
 83: with np.printoptions(threshold=5):
 84:   print("\nWith threshold=5:")
 85:   print(arr)
 86: 
 87: # Change edgeitems too
 88: with np.printoptions(threshold=5, edgeitems=2):
 89:   print("\nWith threshold=5, edgeitems=2:")
 90:   print(arr)
 91: ```
 92: 
 93: **Output:**
 94: 
 95: ```
 96: Original:
 97: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
 98: 
 99: With threshold=5:
100: [0 1 2 ... 7 8 9]
101: 
102: With threshold=5, edgeitems=2:
103: [0 1 ... 8 9]
104: ```
105: You can see how lowering the `threshold` caused the array (size 10) to be summarized, and `edgeitems` controlled how many elements were shown at the ends.
106: 
107: ### 2. Floating-Point Precision (`precision` and `suppress`)
108: 
109: *   `precision`: Controls the number of digits displayed after the decimal point for floats. (Default: 8)
110: *   `suppress`: If `True`, prevents NumPy from using scientific notation for very small numbers and prints them as zero if they are smaller than the current precision. (Default: False)
111: 
112: ```python
113: import numpy as np
114: 
115: # An array with floating-point numbers
116: float_arr = np.array([0.123456789, 1.5e-10, 2.987])
117: print("Default precision:")
118: print(float_arr)
119: 
120: # Set precision to 3
121: with np.printoptions(precision=3):
122:   print("\nWith precision=3:")
123:   print(float_arr)
124: 
125: # Set precision to 3 and suppress small numbers
126: with np.printoptions(precision=3, suppress=True):
127:   print("\nWith precision=3, suppress=True:")
128:   print(float_arr)
129: ```
130: 
131: **Output:**
132: 
133: ```
134: Default precision:
135: [1.23456789e-01 1.50000000e-10 2.98700000e+00]
136: 
137: With precision=3:
138: [1.235e-01 1.500e-10 2.987e+00]
139: 
140: With precision=3, suppress=True:
141: [0.123 0.    2.987]
142: ```
143: Notice how `precision` changed the rounding, and `suppress=True` made the very small number (`1.5e-10`) display as `0.` and switched from scientific notation to fixed-point for the others. There's also a `floatmode` option for more fine-grained control over float formatting (e.g., 'fixed', 'unique').
144: 
145: ### 3. Line Width (`linewidth`)
146: 
147: *   `linewidth`: The maximum number of characters allowed per line before wrapping. (Default: 75)
148: 
149: ```python
150: import numpy as np
151: 
152: # A 2D array
153: arr2d = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4) * 0.1
154: print("Default linewidth:")
155: print(arr2d)
156: 
157: # Set a narrow linewidth
158: with np.printoptions(linewidth=30):
159:   print("\nWith linewidth=30:")
160:   print(arr2d)
161: ```
162: 
163: **Output:**
164: 
165: ```
166: Default linewidth:
167: [[0.  0.1 0.2 0.3]
168:  [0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7]
169:  [0.8 0.9 1.  1.1]]
170: 
171: With linewidth=30:
172: [[0.  0.1 0.2 0.3]
173:  [0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7]
174:  [0.8 0.9 1.  1.1]]
175: ```
176: *(Note: The output might not actually wrap here because the lines are short. If the array was wider, you'd see the rows break across multiple lines with the narrower `linewidth` setting.)*
177: 
178: ### 4. Other Options
179: 
180: *   `nanstr`: String representation for Not a Number. (Default: 'nan')
181: *   `infstr`: String representation for Infinity. (Default: 'inf')
182: *   `sign`: Control sign display for floats ('-', '+', or ' ').
183: *   `formatter`: A dictionary to provide completely custom formatting functions for specific data types (like bool, int, float, datetime, etc.). This is more advanced.
184: 
185: ## Using and Customizing Array Printing
186: 
187: You usually interact with array printing implicitly just by displaying an array:
188: 
189: ```python
190: import numpy as np
191: arr = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)
192: 
193: # These both use NumPy's array printing behind the scenes
194: print(arr)         # Calls __str__ -> array_str -> array2string
195: arr                # In interactive sessions, calls __repr__ -> array_repr -> array2string
196: ```
197: 
198: To customize the output, you can use:
199: 
200: 1.  **`np.set_printoptions(...)`:** Sets options globally (for your entire Python session).
201: 2.  **`np.get_printoptions()`:** Returns a dictionary of the current settings.
202: 3.  **`np.printoptions(...)`:** A context manager to set options *temporarily* within a `with` block (as used in the examples above). This is often the preferred way to avoid changing settings permanently.
203: 4.  **`np.array2string(...)`:** A function to get the string representation directly, allowing you to override options just for that one call.
204: 
205: ```python
206: import numpy as np
207: import sys # Needed for sys.maxsize
208: 
209: arr = np.random.rand(10, 10) * 1000
210: 
211: # --- Global Setting ---
212: print("--- Setting threshold globally ---")
213: original_options = np.get_printoptions() # Store original settings
214: np.set_printoptions(threshold=50)
215: print(arr)
216: np.set_printoptions(**original_options) # Restore original settings
217: 
218: # --- Temporary Setting (Context Manager) ---
219: print("\n--- Setting precision temporarily ---")
220: with np.printoptions(precision=2, suppress=True):
221:     print(arr)
222: print("\n--- Back to default precision ---")
223: print(arr) # Options are automatically restored outside the 'with' block
224: 
225: # --- Direct Call with Overrides ---
226: print("\n--- Using array2string with summarization off ---")
227: # Use sys.maxsize to effectively disable summarization
228: arr_string = np.array2string(arr, threshold=sys.maxsize, precision=1)
229: # print(arr_string) # This might still be very long! Let's just print the first few lines
230: print('\n'.join(arr_string.splitlines()[:5]) + '\n...')
231: ```
232: 
233: **Output (will vary due to random numbers):**
234: 
235: ```

283: 
284: ## A Glimpse Under the Hood
285: 
286: What happens when you call `print(my_array)`?
287: 
288: 1.  Python calls the `__str__` method of the `ndarray` object.
289: 2.  NumPy's `ndarray.__str__` method typically calls the internal function `_array_str_implementation`.
290: 3.  `_array_str_implementation` checks for simple cases (like 0-dimensional arrays) and then calls the main workhorse: `array2string`.
291: 4.  **`array2string`** (defined in `numpy/core/arrayprint.py`) takes the array and any specified options (like `precision`, `threshold`, etc.). It also reads the current default print options (managed by `numpy/core/printoptions.py` using context variables).
292: 5.  It determines if the array needs **summarization** based on its `size` and the `threshold` option.
293: 6.  It figures out the **correct formatting function** for the array's `dtype` (e.g., `IntegerFormat`, `FloatingFormat`, `DatetimeFormat`). These formatters handle details like precision, sign, and scientific notation for individual elements. `FloatingFormat`, for example, might use the efficient `dragon4` algorithm (implemented in C) to convert floats to strings accurately.
294: 7.  It recursively processes the array's dimensions:
295:     *   For each element (or summarized chunk), it calls the chosen formatting function to get its string representation.
296:     *   It arranges these strings, adding separators (like spaces or commas) and brackets (`[` `]`).
297:     *   It checks the `linewidth` and inserts line breaks and indentation as needed.
298:     *   If summarizing, it inserts the ellipsis (`...`) string (`summary_insert`).
299: 8.  Finally, `array2string` returns the complete, formatted string representation of the array.

321:     NDArray-->>Python: Return formatted string
322:     Python-->>User: Display formatted string
323: ```
324: 
325: The core logic resides in `numpy/core/arrayprint.py`. This file contains `array2string`, `array_repr`, `array_str`, and various formatter classes (`FloatingFormat`, `IntegerFormat`, `BoolFormat`, `ComplexFloatingFormat`, `DatetimeFormat`, `TimedeltaFormat`, `StructuredVoidFormat`, etc.). The global print options themselves are managed using Python's `contextvars` in `numpy/core/printoptions.py`, allowing settings to be changed globally or temporarily within a context.
326: 
327: ## Conclusion
328: 
329: You've now learned how NumPy takes potentially huge and complex arrays and turns them into readable string representations using its `arrayprint` mechanism. Key takeaways:
330: 
331: *   `arrayprint` is NumPy's "pretty printer" for arrays.
332: *   It uses **summarization** (`threshold`, `edgeitems`) for large arrays.
333: *   It controls **formatting** (like `precision`, `suppress` for floats) and **layout** (`linewidth`).
334: *   You can customize printing **globally** (`set_printoptions`), **temporarily** (`printoptions` context manager), or for **single calls** (`array2string`).
335: *   The core logic resides in `numpy/core/arrayprint.py`, using formatters tailored to different dtypes and reading options from `numpy/core/printoptions.py`.
336: 
337: Understanding array printing helps you effectively inspect and share your NumPy data.
338: 
339: Next, we'll start looking at the specific C and Python modules that form the core of NumPy's implementation, beginning with the central [Chapter 6: multiarray Module](06_multiarray_module.md).

  8: # Chapter 6: multiarray Module
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 5: Array Printing (`arrayprint`)](05_array_printing___arrayprint__.md), we saw how NumPy takes complex arrays and presents them in a readable format. We've now covered the array container ([`ndarray`](01_ndarray__n_dimensional_array_.md)), its data types ([`dtype`](02_dtype__data_type_object_.md)), the functions that compute on them ([`ufunc`](03_ufunc__universal_function_.md)), the catalog of types ([`numerictypes`](04_numeric_types___numerictypes__.md)), and how arrays are displayed ([`arrayprint`](05_array_printing___arrayprint__.md)).
 11: 
 12: Now, let's peek deeper into the engine room. Where does the fundamental `ndarray` object *actually* come from? How are core operations like creating arrays or accessing elements implemented so efficiently? The answer lies largely within the C code associated with the concept of the `multiarray` module.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does `multiarray` Solve? Providing the Engine
 15: 
 16: Think about the very first step in using NumPy: creating an array.
 17: 
 18: ```python
 19: import numpy as np
 20: 
 21: # How does this seemingly simple line actually work?
 22: my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
 23: 
 24: # How does NumPy know its shape? How is the data stored?
 25: print(my_array)
 26: print(my_array.shape)
 27: ```
 28: 
 29: When you execute `np.array()`, you're using a convenient Python function. But NumPy's speed doesn't come from Python itself. It comes from highly optimized code written in the C programming language. How do these Python functions connect to that fast C code? And where is that C code defined?
 30: 
 31: The `multiarray` concept represents this core C engine. It's the part of NumPy responsible for:
 32: 
 33: 1.  **Defining the `ndarray` object:** The very structure that holds your data, its shape, its data type ([`dtype`](02_dtype__data_type_object_.md)), and how it's laid out in memory.
 34: 2.  **Implementing Fundamental Operations:** Providing the low-level C functions for creating arrays (like allocating memory), accessing elements (indexing), changing the view (slicing, reshaping), and basic mathematical operations.
 35: 
 36: Think of the Python functions like `np.array`, `np.zeros`, or accessing `arr.shape` as the dashboard and controls of a car. The `multiarray` C code is the powerful engine under the hood that actually makes the car move efficiently.
 37: 
 38: ## What is the `multiarray` Module (Concept)?
 39: 
 40: Historically, `multiarray` was a distinct C extension module in NumPy. An "extension module" is a module written in C (or C++) that Python can import and use just like a regular Python module. This allows Python code to leverage the speed of C for performance-critical tasks.
 41: 
 42: More recently (since NumPy 1.16), the C code for `multiarray` was merged with the C code for the [ufunc (Universal Function)](03_ufunc__universal_function_.md) system (which we'll discuss more in [Chapter 7: umath Module](07_umath_module.md)) into a single, larger C extension module typically called `_multiarray_umath.cpython-*.so` (on Linux/Mac) or `_multiarray_umath.pyd` (on Windows).
 43: 
 44: Even though the C code is merged, the *concept* of `multiarray` remains important. It represents the C implementation layer that provides:
 45: 
 46: *   The **`ndarray` object type** itself (`PyArrayObject` in C).
 47: *   The **C-API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of C functions that can be called by other C extensions (and internally by NumPy's Python code) to work with `ndarray` objects. Examples include functions to create arrays from data, get the shape, get the data pointer, perform indexing, etc.
 48: *   Implementations of **core array functionalities**: array creation, data type handling ([`dtype`](02_dtype__data_type_object_.md)), memory layout management (strides), indexing, slicing, reshaping, transposing, and some basic operations.
 49: 
 50: The Python files you might see in the NumPy source code, like `numpy/core/multiarray.py` and `numpy/core/numeric.py`, often serve as Python wrappers. They provide the user-friendly Python functions (like `np.array`, `np.empty`, `np.dot`) that eventually call the fast C functions implemented within the `_multiarray_umath` extension module.
 51: 
 52: ```python
 53: # numpy/core/multiarray.py - Simplified Example
 54: # This Python file imports directly from the C extension module
 55: 
 56: from . import _multiarray_umath # Import the compiled C module
 57: from ._multiarray_umath import * # Make C functions available
 58: 
 59: # Functions like 'array', 'empty', 'dot' that you use via `np.`
 60: # might be defined or re-exported here, ultimately calling C code.
 61: # For example, the `array` function here might parse the Python input
 62: # and then call a C function like `PyArray_NewFromDescr` from _multiarray_umath.
 63: ```
 64: 
 65: This structure gives you the flexibility and ease of Python on the surface, powered by the speed and efficiency of C underneath.
 66: 
 67: ## A Glimpse Under the Hood: Creating an Array
 68: 
 69: Let's trace what happens when you call `my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3])`:
 70: 
 71: 1.  **Python Call:** You call the Python function `np.array`. This function likely lives in `numpy/core/numeric.py` or is exposed through `numpy/core/multiarray.py`.
 72: 2.  **Argument Parsing:** The Python function examines the input `[1, 2, 3]`. It figures out the data type (likely `int64` by default on many systems) and the shape (which is `(3,)`).
 73: 3.  **Call C-API Function:** The Python function calls a specific function within the compiled `_multiarray_umath` C extension module. This C function is designed to create a new array. A common one is `PyArray_NewFromDescr` or a related helper.
 74: 4.  **Memory Allocation (C):** The C function asks the operating system for a block of memory large enough to hold 3 integers of the chosen type (e.g., 3 * 8 bytes = 24 bytes for `int64`).
 75: 5.  **Data Copying (C):** The C function copies the values `1`, `2`, and `3` from the Python list into the newly allocated memory block.
 76: 6.  **Create C `ndarray` Struct:** The C function creates an internal C structure (called `PyArrayObject`). This structure stores:
 77:     *   A pointer to the actual data block in memory.
 78:     *   Information about the data type ([`dtype`](02_dtype__data_type_object_.md)).
 79:     *   The shape of the array (`(3,)`).
 80:     *   The strides (how many bytes to jump to get to the next element in each dimension).
 81:     *   Other metadata (like flags indicating if it owns the data, if it's writeable, etc.).
 82: 7.  **Wrap in Python Object:** The C function wraps this internal `PyArrayObject` structure into a Python object that Python can understand – the `ndarray` object you interact with.
 83: 8.  **Return to Python:** The C function returns this new Python `ndarray` object back to your Python code, which assigns it to the variable `my_array`.
 84: 
 85: Here's a simplified view of that flow:
 86: 
 87: ```mermaid

 99:     C_API->>PyFunc: Return Python ndarray object wrapping the C struct
100:     PyFunc-->>User: Assign returned ndarray object to `my_array`
101: ```
102: 
103: **Where is the Code?**
104: 
105: *   **C Implementation:** The core logic is in C files compiled into the `_multiarray_umath` extension module (e.g., parts of `numpy/core/src/multiarray/`). Files like `alloc.c`, `ctors.c` (constructors), `getset.c` (for getting/setting attributes like shape), `item_selection.c` (indexing) contain relevant C code.
106: *   **Python Wrappers:** `numpy/core/numeric.py` and `numpy/core/multiarray.py` provide many of the familiar Python functions. They import directly from `_multiarray_umath`.
107:     ```python
108:     # From numpy/core/numeric.py - Simplified
109:     from . import multiarray # Imports numpy/core/multiarray.py
110:     # multiarray.py itself imports from _multiarray_umath
111:     from .multiarray import (
112:         array, asarray, zeros, empty, # Functions defined/re-exported
113:         # ... many others ...
114:     )
115:     ```
116: *   **Initialization:** `numpy/core/__init__.py` helps set up the `numpy.core` namespace, importing from `multiarray` and `umath`.
117:     ```python
118:     # From numpy/core/__init__.py - Simplified
119:     from . import multiarray
120:     from . import umath
121:     # ... other imports ...
122:     from . import numeric
123:     from .numeric import * # Pulls in functions like np.array, np.zeros
124:     # ... more setup ...
125:     ```
126: *   **C API Definition:** Files like `numpy/core/include/numpy/multiarray.h` define the C structures (`PyArrayObject`) and function prototypes (`PyArray_NewFromDescr`, etc.) that make up the NumPy C-API. Code generators like `numpy/core/code_generators/generate_numpy_api.py` help create tables (`__multiarray_api.h`, `__multiarray_api.c`) that allow other C extensions to easily access these core NumPy C functions.
127:     ```python
128:     # Snippet from numpy/core/code_generators/generate_numpy_api.py
129:     # This script generates C code that defines an array of function pointers
130:     # making up the C-API.
131: 
132:     # Describes API functions, their index in the API table, return type, args...
133:     multiarray_funcs = {
134:         # ... many functions ...
135:         'NewLikeArray': (10, None, 'PyObject *', (('PyArrayObject *', 'prototype'), ...)),
136:         'NewFromDescr': (9, None, 'PyObject *', ...),
137:         'Empty': (8, None, 'PyObject *', ...),
138:         # ...
139:     }
140: 
141:     # ... code to generate C header (.h) and implementation (.c) files ...
142:     # These generated files help expose the C functions consistently.
143:     ```
144: 
145: ## Conclusion
146: 
147: You've now learned about the conceptual `multiarray` module, the C engine at the heart of NumPy.
148: 
149: *   It's implemented in **C** (as part of the `_multiarray_umath` extension module) for maximum **speed and efficiency**.
150: *   It provides the fundamental **`ndarray` object** structure.
151: *   It implements **core array operations** like creation, memory management, indexing, and reshaping at a low level.
152: *   Python modules like `numpy.core.numeric` and `numpy.core.multiarray` provide user-friendly interfaces that call this underlying C code.
153: *   Understanding this separation helps explain *why* NumPy is so fast compared to standard Python lists for numerical tasks.
154: 
155: While `multiarray` provides the array structure and basic manipulation, the element-wise mathematical operations often rely on another closely related C implementation layer.
156: 
157: Let's explore that next in [Chapter 7: umath Module](07_umath_module.md).

  8: # Chapter 7: umath Module
  9: 
 10: Welcome to Chapter 7! In [Chapter 6: multiarray Module](06_multiarray_module.md), we explored the core C engine that defines the `ndarray` object and handles fundamental operations like creating arrays and accessing elements. We saw that the actual power comes from C code.
 11: 
 12: But what about the mathematical operations themselves? When you perform `np.sin(my_array)` or `array1 + array2`, which part of the C engine handles the actual sine calculation or the addition for *every single element*? This is where the concept of the `umath` module comes in.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does `umath` Solve? Implementing Fast Array Math
 15: 
 16: Remember the [ufunc (Universal Function)](03_ufunc__universal_function_.md) from Chapter 3? Ufuncs are NumPy's special functions designed to operate element-wise on arrays with incredible speed (like `np.add`, `np.sin`, `np.log`).
 17: 
 18: Let's take a simple example:
 19: 
 20: ```python
 21: import numpy as np
 22: 
 23: angles = np.array([0, np.pi/2, np.pi])
 24: sines = np.sin(angles) # How is this sine calculated so fast?
 25: 
 26: print(angles)
 27: print(sines)
 28: ```
 29: 
 30: **Output:**
 31: 
 32: ```
 33: [0.         1.57079633 3.14159265]
 34: [0.0000000e+00 1.0000000e+00 1.2246468e-16] # Note: pi value is approximate
 35: ```
 36: 
 37: The Python function `np.sin` acts as a dispatcher. It needs to hand off the actual, heavy-duty work of calculating the sine for each element in the `angles` array to highly optimized code. Where does this optimized code live?
 38: 
 39: Historically, the C code responsible for implementing the *loops and logic* of these mathematical ufuncs (like addition, subtraction, sine, cosine, logarithm, etc.) was contained within a dedicated C extension module called `umath`. It provided the fast, element-by-element computational kernels.
 40: 
 41: ## What is the `umath` Module (Concept)?
 42: 
 43: The `umath` module represents the part of NumPy's C core dedicated to implementing **universal functions (ufuncs)**. Think of it as NumPy's built-in, highly optimized math library specifically designed for element-wise operations on arrays.
 44: 
 45: **Key Points:**
 46: 
 47: 1.  **Houses ufunc Implementations:** It contains the low-level C code that performs the actual calculations for functions like `np.add`, `np.sin`, `np.exp`, `np.sqrt`, etc.
 48: 2.  **Optimized Loops:** This C code includes specialized loops that iterate over the array elements very efficiently, often tailored for specific [dtype (Data Type Object)](02_dtype__data_type_object_.md)s (like a fast loop for adding 32-bit integers, another for 64-bit floats, etc.).
 49: 3.  **Historical C Module:** Originally, `umath` was a separate compiled C extension module (`umath.so` or `umath.pyd`).
 50: 4.  **Merged with `multiarray`:** Since NumPy 1.16, the C code for `umath` has been merged with the C code for `multiarray` into a single, larger C extension module named `_multiarray_umath`. While they are now in the same compiled file, the *functions and purpose* associated with `umath` (implementing ufunc math) are distinct from those associated with `multiarray` (array object structure and basic manipulation).
 51: 5.  **Python Access (`numpy/core/umath.py`):** You don't usually interact with the C code directly. Instead, NumPy provides Python functions (like `np.add`, `np.sin`) in the Python file `numpy/core/umath.py`. These Python functions are wrappers that know how to find and trigger the correct C implementation within the `_multiarray_umath` extension module.
 52: 
 53: **Analogy:** Imagine `multiarray` builds the car chassis and engine block (`ndarray` structure). `umath` provides specialized, high-performance engine components like the fuel injectors for addition (`np.add`'s C code), the turbocharger for exponentiation (`np.exp`'s C code), and the precise valve timing for trigonometry (`np.sin`'s C code). The Python functions (`np.add`, `np.sin`) are the pedals and buttons you use to activate these components.
 54: 
 55: ## How it Works (Usage Perspective)
 56: 
 57: As a NumPy user, you typically trigger the `umath` C code indirectly by calling a ufunc:
 58: 
 59: ```python
 60: import numpy as np
 61: 
 62: a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
 63: b = np.array([10, 20, 30])
 64: 
 65: # Calling the ufunc np.add
 66: result1 = np.add(a, b) # Triggers the C implementation for addition
 67: 
 68: # Using the operator '+' which also calls np.add for arrays
 69: result2 = a + b        # Also triggers the C implementation
 70: 
 71: print(f"Using np.add: {result1}")
 72: print(f"Using + operator: {result2}")
 73: ```
 74: 
 75: **Output:**
 76: 
 77: ```
 78: Using np.add: [11 22 33]
 79: Using + operator: [11 22 33]
 80: ```
 81: 
 82: Both `np.add(a, b)` and `a + b` ultimately lead to NumPy executing the highly optimized C code associated with the addition ufunc, which conceptually belongs to the `umath` part of the core.
 83: 
 84: ## A Glimpse Under the Hood
 85: 
 86: When you call a ufunc like `np.add(a, b)`:
 87: 
 88: 1.  **Python Call:** You invoke the Python function `np.add` (found in `numpy/core/umath.py` or exposed through `numpy/core/__init__.py`).
 89: 2.  **Identify Ufunc Object:** This Python function accesses the corresponding ufunc object (`np.add` itself is a ufunc object). This object holds metadata about the operation.
 90: 3.  **Dispatch to C:** The ufunc object mechanism (part of the `_multiarray_umath` C core) takes over.
 91: 4.  **Type Resolution & Loop Selection:** The C code inspects the `dtype`s of the input arrays (`a` and `b`). Based on the input types, it looks up an internal table associated with the `add` ufunc to find the *best* matching, pre-compiled C loop. For example, if `a` and `b` are both `int64`, it selects the C function specifically designed for `int64 + int64 -> int64`. This selection process might involve type casting rules (e.g., adding `int32` and `float64` might choose a loop that operates on `float64`).
 92: 5.  **Execute C Loop:** The selected C function (the core `umath` implementation for this specific type combination) is executed. This function iterates efficiently over the input array(s) memory, performs the addition element by element, and stores the results in the output array's memory.
 93: 6.  **Return Result:** The C machinery wraps the output memory into a new `ndarray` object and returns it back to your Python code.

117:     PyUfunc-->>User: Assign result ndarray to 'result'
118: 
119: ```
120: 
121: **Where is the Code?**
122: 
123: *   **C Extension Module:** The compiled code lives in `_multiarray_umath.so` / `.pyd`.
124: *   **Ufunc Definition & Generation:** The script `numpy/core/code_generators/generate_umath.py` is crucial. It contains definitions (like the `defdict` dictionary) that describe each ufunc: its name, number of inputs/outputs, identity element, the C functions to use for different type combinations (`TD` entries), and associated docstrings. This script generates C code (`__umath_generated.c`, which is then compiled) that sets up the ufunc objects and their internal loop tables.
125:     ```python
126:     # Simplified snippet from generate_umath.py's defdict for 'add'
127:     'add':
128:         Ufunc(2, 1, Zero, # nin=2, nout=1, identity=0
129:               docstrings.get('numpy._core.umath.add'), # Docstring reference
130:               'PyUFunc_AdditionTypeResolver', # Type resolution logic
131:               TD('?', ...), # Loop for booleans
132:               TD(no_bool_times_obj, dispatch=[...]), # Loops for numeric types
133:               # ... loops for datetime, object ...
134:               ),
135:     ```
136:     This definition tells the generator how to build the `np.add` ufunc, including which C functions (often defined in other C files or generated from templates) handle addition for different data types.
137: *   **C Loop Implementations:** The actual C code performing the math often comes from template files (like `numpy/core/src/umath/loops.c.src`) or CPU-dispatch-specific files (like `numpy/core/src/umath/loops_arithm_fp.dispatch.c.src`). These `.src` files contain templates written in a C-like syntax that get processed to generate specific C code for various data types (e.g., generating `int32_add`, `int64_add`, `float32_add`, `float64_add` from a single addition template). The dispatch files allow NumPy to choose optimized code paths (using e.g., AVX2, AVX512 instructions) based on your CPU's capabilities at runtime.
138: *   **Python Wrappers:** `numpy/core/umath.py` provides the Python functions like `np.add`, `np.sin` that you call. It primarily imports these functions directly from the `_multiarray_umath` C extension module.
139:     ```python
140:     # From numpy/core/umath.py - Simplified
141:     from . import _multiarray_umath
142:     from ._multiarray_umath import * # Imports C-defined ufuncs like 'add'
143: 
144:     # Functions like 'add', 'sin', 'log' are now available in this module's
145:     # namespace, ready to be used via `np.add`, `np.sin`, etc.
146:     ```
147: *   **Namespace Setup:** `numpy/core/__init__.py` imports from `numpy.core.umath` (among others) to make functions like `np.add` easily accessible under the main `np` namespace.
148: 
149: ## Conclusion
150: 
151: You've now seen that the `umath` concept represents the implementation heart of NumPy's universal functions.
152: 
153: *   It provides the optimized **C code** that performs element-wise mathematical operations.
154: *   It contains specialized **loops** for different data types, crucial for NumPy's speed.
155: *   While historically a separate C module, its functionality is now part of the merged `_multiarray_umath` C extension.
156: *   Python files like `numpy/core/umath.py` provide access, but the real work happens in C, often defined via generators like `generate_umath.py` and implemented in templated `.src` or dispatchable C files.
157: 
158: Understanding `umath` clarifies where the computational power for element-wise operations originates within NumPy's core.
159: 
160: So far, we've focused on NumPy's built-in functions. But how does NumPy interact with other libraries or allow customization of how operations work on its arrays?
161: 
162: Next, we'll explore a powerful mechanism for extending NumPy's reach: [Chapter 8: __array_function__ Protocol / Overrides (`overrides`)](08___array_function___protocol___overrides___overrides__.md).

  8: # Chapter 8: __array_function__ Protocol / Overrides (`overrides`)
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the final chapter of our NumPy Core exploration! In [Chapter 7: umath Module](07_umath_module.md), we learned how NumPy implements its fast, element-wise mathematical functions (`ufuncs`) using optimized C code. We've seen the core components: the `ndarray` container, `dtype` descriptions, `ufunc` operations, numeric types, printing, and the C modules (`multiarray`, `umath`) that power them.
 11: 
 12: But NumPy doesn't exist in isolation. The Python scientific ecosystem is full of other libraries that also work with array-like data. Think of libraries like Dask (for parallel computing on large datasets that don't fit in memory) or CuPy (for running NumPy-like operations on GPUs). How can these *different* types of arrays work smoothly with standard NumPy functions like `np.sum`, `np.mean`, or `np.concatenate`?
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does `__array_function__` Solve? Speaking NumPy's Language
 15: 
 16: Imagine you have a special type of array, maybe one that lives on a GPU (like a CuPy array) or one that represents a computation spread across many machines (like a Dask array). You want to calculate the sum of its elements.
 17: 
 18: Ideally, you'd just write:
 19: 
 20: ```python
 21: # Assume 'my_special_array' is an instance of a custom array type
 22: # (e.g., from CuPy or Dask)
 23: result = np.sum(my_special_array)
 24: ```
 25: 
 26: But wait, `np.sum` is a NumPy function, designed primarily for NumPy's `ndarray` ([Chapter 1: ndarray (N-dimensional array)](01_ndarray__n_dimensional_array_.md)). How can it possibly know how to sum elements on a GPU or coordinate a distributed calculation?
 27: 
 28: Before the `__array_function__` protocol, this was tricky. Either the library (like CuPy) had to provide its *own* complete set of functions (`cupy.sum`), or NumPy would have needed specific code to handle every possible external array type, which is impossible to maintain.
 29: 
 30: We need a way for NumPy functions to ask the input objects: "Hey, do *you* know how to handle this operation (`np.sum` in this case)?" If the object says yes, NumPy can step back and let the object take control.
 31: 
 32: This is exactly what the `__array_function__` protocol (defined in NEP-18) allows. It's like a common language or negotiation rule that lets different array libraries "override" or take over the execution of NumPy functions when their objects are involved.
 33: 
 34: **Analogy:** Think of NumPy functions as a universal remote control. Initially, it only knows how to control NumPy-brand TVs (`ndarray`s). The `__array_function__` protocol is like adding a feature where the remote, when pointed at a different brand TV (like a CuPy array), asks the TV: "Do you understand this button (e.g., 'sum')?" If the TV responds, "Yes, here's how I do 'sum'," the remote lets the TV handle it.
 35: 
 36: ## What is the `__array_function__` Protocol?
 37: 
 38: The `__array_function__` protocol is a special method that array-like objects can implement. When a NumPy function is called with arguments that include one or more objects defining `__array_function__`, NumPy follows these steps:
 39: 
 40: 1.  **Check Arguments:** NumPy looks at all the input arguments passed to the function (e.g., `np.sum(my_array, axis=0)`).
 41: 2.  **Find Overrides:** It identifies which arguments have an `__array_function__` method.
 42: 3.  **Prioritize:** It sorts these arguments based on a special attribute (`__array_priority__`) or by their position in the function call if priorities are equal. Subclasses are also considered.
 43: 4.  **Negotiate:** It calls the `__array_function__` method of the highest-priority object. It passes two key pieces of information to this method:
 44:     *   The original NumPy function object itself (e.g., `np.sum`).
 45:     *   The arguments (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) that were originally passed to the NumPy function.
 46: 5.  **Delegate:** The object's `__array_function__` method now has control. It can:
 47:     *   Handle the operation itself (e.g., perform a GPU sum if it's a CuPy array) and return the result.
 48:     *   Decide it *cannot* handle this specific function or combination of arguments and return a special value `NotImplemented`. In this case, NumPy tries the `__array_function__` method of the *next* highest-priority object.
 49:     *   Potentially call the original NumPy function on converted inputs if needed.
 50: 6.  **Fallback:** If *no* object's `__array_function__` method handles the call (they all return `NotImplemented`), NumPy raises a `TypeError`. *Crucially, NumPy usually does NOT fall back to its own default implementation on the foreign objects unless explicitly told to by the override.*
 51: 
 52: ## Using `__array_function__` (Implementing a Simple Override)
 53: 
 54: Let's create a very basic array-like class that overrides `np.sum` but lets other functions pass through (by returning `NotImplemented`).
 55: 
 56: ```python
 57: import numpy as np
 58: 
 59: class MySimpleArray:
 60:     def __init__(self, data):
 61:         # Store data internally, maybe as a NumPy array for simplicity here
 62:         self._data = np.asarray(data)
 63: 
 64:     # This is the magic method!
 65:     def __array_function__(self, func, types, args, kwargs):
 66:         print(f"MySimpleArray.__array_function__ got called for {func.__name__}")
 67: 
 68:         if func is np.sum:
 69:             # Handle np.sum ourselves!
 70:             print("-> Handling np.sum internally!")
 71:             # Convert args to NumPy arrays if they are MySimpleArray
 72:             np_args = [a._data if isinstance(a, MySimpleArray) else a for a in args]
 73:             np_kwargs = {k: v._data if isinstance(v, MySimpleArray) else v for k, v in kwargs.items()}
 74:             # Perform the actual sum using NumPy on the internal data
 75:             return np.sum(*np_args, **np_kwargs)
 76:         else:
 77:             # For any other function, say we don't handle it
 78:             print(f"-> Don't know how to handle {func.__name__}, returning NotImplemented.")
 79:             return NotImplemented
 80: 
 81:     # Make it look a bit like an array for printing
 82:     def __repr__(self):
 83:         return f"MySimpleArray({self._data})"
 84: 
 85: # --- Try it out ---
 86: my_arr = MySimpleArray([1, 2, 3, 4])
 87: print("Array:", my_arr)
 88: 
 89: # Call np.sum
 90: print("\nCalling np.sum(my_arr):")
 91: total = np.sum(my_arr)
 92: print("Result:", total)
 93: 
 94: # Call np.mean (which our class doesn't handle)
 95: print("\nCalling np.mean(my_arr):")
 96: try:
 97:     mean_val = np.mean(my_arr)
 98:     print("Result:", mean_val)
 99: except TypeError as e:
100:     print("Caught expected TypeError:", e)
101: ```
102: 
103: **Output:**

106: Array: MySimpleArray([1 2 3 4])
107: 
108: Calling np.sum(my_arr):
109: MySimpleArray.__array_function__ got called for sum
110: -> Handling np.sum internally!
111: Result: 10

113: Calling np.mean(my_arr):
114: MySimpleArray.__array_function__ got called for mean
115: -> Don't know how to handle mean, returning NotImplemented.
116: Caught expected TypeError: no implementation found for 'numpy.mean' on types that implement __array_function__: [<class '__main__.MySimpleArray'>]
117: ```
118: 
119: **Explanation:**
120: 
121: 1.  We created `MySimpleArray` which holds some data (here, a standard NumPy array `_data`).
122: 2.  We implemented `__array_function__(self, func, types, args, kwargs)`.
123:     *   `func`: The NumPy function being called (e.g., `np.sum`, `np.mean`).
124:     *   `types`: A tuple of unique types implementing `__array_function__` in the arguments.
125:     *   `args`, `kwargs`: The original arguments passed to `func`.
126: 3.  Inside `__array_function__`, we check if `func` is `np.sum`.
127:     *   If yes, we print a message, extract the internal `_data` from any `MySimpleArray` arguments, call `np.sum` on that data, and return the result. NumPy uses this returned value directly.
128:     *   If no (like for `np.mean`), we print a message and return `NotImplemented`.
129: 4.  When we call `np.sum(my_arr)`, NumPy detects `__array_function__` on `my_arr`. It calls it. Our method handles `np.sum` and returns `10`.
130: 5.  When we call `np.mean(my_arr)`, NumPy again calls `__array_function__`. This time, our method returns `NotImplemented`. Since no other arguments handle it, NumPy raises a `TypeError` because it doesn't know how to calculate the mean of `MySimpleArray` by default.
131: 
132: This example demonstrates how an external library object can selectively take control of NumPy functions. Libraries like CuPy or Dask implement `__array_function__` much more thoroughly, handling many NumPy functions to perform operations on their specific data representations (GPU arrays, distributed arrays).
133: 
134: ## A Glimpse Under the Hood (`overrides.py`)
135: 
136: How does NumPy actually manage this dispatching process? The logic lives primarily in the `numpy/core/overrides.py` module.
137: 
138: 1.  **Decorator:** Many NumPy functions (especially those intended to be public and potentially overridden) are decorated with `@array_function_dispatch(...)` or a similar helper (`@array_function_from_dispatcher`). You can see this decorator used in files like `numpy/core/function_base.py` (for `linspace`, `logspace`, etc.) or `numpy/core/numeric.py` (for `sum`, `mean`, etc. indirectly via ufunc machinery).
139:     ```python
140:     # Example from numpy/core/function_base.py (simplified)
141:     from numpy._core import overrides
142: 
143:     array_function_dispatch = functools.partial(
144:         overrides.array_function_dispatch, module='numpy')
145: 
146:     def _linspace_dispatcher(start, stop, num=None, ...):
147:         # This helper identifies arguments relevant for dispatch
148:         return (start, stop)
149: 
150:     @array_function_dispatch(_linspace_dispatcher) # Decorator applied!
151:     def linspace(start, stop, num=50, ...):
152:         # ... Actual implementation for NumPy arrays ...
153:         pass
154:     ```
155: 2.  **Dispatcher Class:** The decorator wraps the original function (like `linspace`) in a special callable object, often an instance of `_ArrayFunctionDispatcher`.
156: 3.  **Call Interception:** When you call the decorated NumPy function (e.g., `np.linspace(...)`), you're actually calling the `_ArrayFunctionDispatcher` object.
157: 4.  **Argument Check (`_get_implementing_args`):** The dispatcher object first calls the little helper function provided to the decorator (like `_linspace_dispatcher`) to figure out which arguments are relevant for checking the `__array_function__` protocol. Then, it calls the C helper function `_get_implementing_args` (defined in `numpy/core/src/multiarray/overrides.c`) which efficiently inspects the relevant arguments, finds those with `__array_function__`, and sorts them according to priority and type relationships.
158: 5.  **Delegation Loop:** The dispatcher iterates through the implementing arguments found in step 4 (from highest priority to lowest). For each one, it calls its `__array_function__` method.
159: 6.  **Handle Result:**
160:     *   If `__array_function__` returns a value other than `NotImplemented`, the dispatcher immediately returns that value to the original caller. The process stops.
161:     *   If `__array_function__` returns `NotImplemented`, the dispatcher continues to the next implementing argument in the list.
162: 7.  **Error or Default:** If the loop finishes without any override handling the call, a `TypeError` is raised.
163: 
164: Here's a simplified sequence diagram for `np.sum(my_arr)`:
165: 
166: ```mermaid
167: sequenceDiagram
168:     participant User
169:     participant NumPyFunc as np.sum (Dispatcher Object)
170:     participant Overrides as numpy.core.overrides
171:     participant CustomArr as my_arr (MySimpleArray)
172: 
173:     User->>NumPyFunc: np.sum(my_arr)
174:     NumPyFunc->>Overrides: Get relevant args (my_arr)
175:     Overrides->>Overrides: _get_implementing_args([my_arr])
176:     Overrides-->>NumPyFunc: Found [my_arr] implements __array_function__
177:     NumPyFunc->>CustomArr: call __array_function__(func=np.sum, ...)
178:     CustomArr->>CustomArr: Check if func is np.sum (Yes)
179:     CustomArr->>CustomArr: Perform custom sum logic
180:     CustomArr-->>NumPyFunc: Return result (e.g., 10)
181:     NumPyFunc-->>User: Return result (10)
182: ```
183: 
184: The `numpy/core/overrides.py` file defines the Python-level infrastructure (`array_function_dispatch`, `_ArrayFunctionDispatcher`), while the core logic for efficiently finding and sorting implementing arguments (`_get_implementing_args`) is implemented in C for performance.
185: 
186: ## Conclusion
187: 
188: The `__array_function__` protocol is a powerful mechanism that makes NumPy far more extensible and integrated with the wider Python ecosystem. You've learned:
189: 
190: *   It allows objects from **other libraries** (like Dask, CuPy) to **override** how NumPy functions behave when passed instances of those objects.
191: *   It works via a special method, `__array_function__`, that implementing objects define.
192: *   NumPy **negotiates** with arguments: it checks for the method and **delegates** the call if an argument handles it.
193: *   This enables writing code that looks like standard NumPy (`np.sum(my_obj)`) but can operate seamlessly on diverse array types (CPU, GPU, distributed).
194: *   The dispatch logic is managed primarily by decorators and helpers in `numpy/core/overrides.py`, relying on a C function (`_get_implementing_args`) for efficient argument checking.
195: 
196: This protocol is a key part of why NumPy remains central to scientific computing in Python, allowing it to interact smoothly with specialized array libraries without requiring NumPy itself to know the specifics of each one.
197: 
198: This concludes our tour through the core concepts of NumPy! We hope this journey from the fundamental `ndarray` to the sophisticated `__array_function__` protocol has given you a deeper appreciation for how NumPy works under the hood.

It uses **dtypes** (data type objects) to precisely define the *kind of data* (like integers or floating-point numbers) stored within an array, ensuring memory efficiency and enabling optimized low-level operations. NumPy also features **ufuncs** (universal functions), which are functions like `add` or `sin` designed to operate *element-wise* on entire arrays very quickly, leveraging compiled code. Together, these components form the foundation for high-performance scientific computing in Python.

  8: # Chapter 1: The LLM - Your Agent's Brainpower
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the OpenManus tutorial! We're thrilled to have you on board. Let's start with the absolute core of any intelligent agent: the "brain" that does the thinking and understanding. In OpenManus, this brainpower comes from something called a **Large Language Model (LLM)**, and we interact with it using our `LLM` class.
 11: 
 12: ## What's the Big Deal with LLMs?
 13: 
 14: Imagine you have access to an incredibly smart expert who understands language, can reason, write, summarize, and even generate creative ideas. That's kind of what an LLM (like GPT-4, Claude, or Llama) is! These are massive AI models trained on vast amounts of text and data, making them capable of understanding and generating human-like text.
 15: 
 16: They are the engine that drives the "intelligence" in AI applications like chatbots, writing assistants, and, of course, the agents you'll build with OpenManus.
 17: 
 18: ## Why Do We Need an `LLM` Class?
 19: 
 20: Okay, so LLMs are powerful. Can't our agent just talk directly to them?
 21: 
 22: Well, it's a bit more complicated than a casual chat. Talking to these big AI models usually involves:
 23: 
 24: 1.  **Complex APIs:** Each LLM provider (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AWS) has its own specific way (an API or Application Programming Interface) to send requests and get responses. It's like needing different phone numbers and dialing procedures for different experts.
 25: 2.  **API Keys:** You need secret keys to prove you're allowed to use the service (and get billed for it!). Managing these securely is important.
 26: 3.  **Formatting:** You need to structure your questions (prompts) and conversation history in a very specific format the LLM understands.
 27: 4.  **Errors & Retries:** Sometimes network connections hiccup, or the LLM service is busy. You need a way to handle these errors gracefully, maybe by trying again.
 28: 5.  **Tracking Usage (Tokens):** Using these powerful models costs money, often based on how much text you send and receive (measured in "tokens"). You need to keep track of this.
 29: 
 30: Doing all this *every time* an agent needs to think would be repetitive and messy!
 31: 
 32: **This is where the `LLM` class comes in.** Think of it as a super-helpful **translator and network manager** rolled into one.
 33: 
 34: *   It knows how to talk to different LLM APIs.
 35: *   It securely handles your API keys (using settings from the [Configuration](07_configuration__config_.md)).
 36: *   It formats your messages correctly.
 37: *   It automatically retries if there's a temporary glitch.
 38: *   It helps count the "tokens" used.
 39: 
 40: It hides all that complexity, giving your agent a simple way to "ask" the LLM something.
 41: 
 42: **Use Case:** Let's say we want our agent to simply answer the question: "What is the capital of France?" The `LLM` class will handle all the background work to get that answer from the actual AI model.
 43: 
 44: ## How Do Agents Use the `LLM` Class?
 45: 
 46: In OpenManus, agents (which we'll learn more about in [Chapter 3: BaseAgent](03_baseagent.md)) have an `llm` component built-in. Usually, you don't even need to create it manually; the agent does it for you when it starts up, using settings from your configuration file (`config/config.toml`).
 47: 
 48: The primary way an agent uses the `LLM` class is through its `ask` method.
 49: 
 50: Let's look at a simplified example of how you might use the `LLM` class directly (though usually, your agent handles this):
 51: 
 52: ```python
 53: # Import necessary classes
 54: from app.llm import LLM
 55: from app.schema import Message
 56: import asyncio # Needed to run asynchronous code
 57: 
 58: # Assume configuration is already loaded (API keys, model name, etc.)
 59: # Create an instance of the LLM class (using default settings)
 60: llm_interface = LLM()
 61: 
 62: # Prepare the question as a list of messages
 63: # (We'll learn more about Messages in Chapter 2)
 64: conversation = [
 65:     Message.user_message("What is the capital of France?")
 66: ]
 67: 
 68: # Define an async function to ask the question
 69: async def ask_question():
 70:     print("Asking the LLM...")
 71:     # Use the 'ask' method to send the conversation
 72:     response = await llm_interface.ask(messages=conversation)
 73:     print(f"LLM Response: {response}")
 74: 
 75: # Run the async function
 76: asyncio.run(ask_question())
 77: ```
 78: 
 79: **Explanation:**
 80: 
 81: 1.  We import the `LLM` class and the `Message` class (more on `Message` in the [next chapter](02_message___memory.md)).
 82: 2.  We create `llm_interface = LLM()`. This sets up our connection to the LLM using settings found in the configuration.
 83: 3.  We create a `conversation` list containing our question, formatted as a `Message` object. The `LLM` class needs the input in this list-of-messages format.
 84: 4.  We call `await llm_interface.ask(messages=conversation)`. This is the core action! We send our message list to the LLM via our interface. The `await` keyword is used because communicating over the network takes time, so we wait for the response asynchronously.
 85: 5.  The `ask` method returns the LLM's text response as a string.
 86: 
 87: **Example Output (might vary slightly):**
 88: 
 89: ```
 90: Asking the LLM...
 91: LLM Response: The capital of France is Paris.
 92: ```
 93: 
 94: See? We just asked a question and got an answer, without worrying about API keys, JSON formatting, or network errors! The `LLM` class handled it all.
 95: 
 96: There's also a more advanced method called `ask_tool`, which allows the LLM to use specific [Tools](04_tool___toolcollection.md), but we'll cover that later. For now, `ask` is the main way to get text responses.
 97: 
 98: ## Under the Hood: What Happens When You `ask`?
 99: 
100: Let's peek behind the curtain. When your agent calls `llm.ask(...)`, several things happen in sequence:
101: 
102: 1.  **Format Messages:** The `LLM` class takes your list of `Message` objects and converts them into the exact dictionary format the specific LLM API (like OpenAI's or AWS Bedrock's) expects. This might involve adding special tags or structuring image data if needed (`llm.py: format_messages`).
103: 2.  **Count Tokens:** It calculates roughly how many "tokens" your input messages will use (`llm.py: count_message_tokens`).
104: 3.  **Check Limits:** It checks if sending this request would exceed any configured token limits (`llm.py: check_token_limit`). If it does, it raises a specific `TokenLimitExceeded` error *before* making the expensive API call.
105: 4.  **Send Request:** It sends the formatted messages and other parameters (like the desired model, `max_tokens`) to the LLM's API endpoint over the internet (`llm.py: client.chat.completions.create` or similar for AWS Bedrock in `bedrock.py`).
106: 5.  **Handle Glitches (Retry):** If the API call fails due to a temporary issue (like a network timeout or the service being momentarily busy), the `LLM` class automatically waits a bit and tries again, up to a few times (thanks to the `@retry` decorator in `llm.py`).
107: 6.  **Receive Response:** Once successful, it receives the response from the LLM API.
108: 7.  **Extract Answer:** It pulls out the actual text content from the API response.
109: 8.  **Update Counts:** It records the number of input tokens used and the number of tokens in the received response (`llm.py: update_token_count`).
110: 9.  **Return Result:** Finally, it returns the LLM's text answer back to your agent.
111: 
112: Here's a simplified diagram showing the flow:

136:     LLMClass-->>-Agent: llm_answer (string)
137: 
138: ```
139: 
140: Let's look at a tiny piece of the `ask` method in `app/llm.py` to see the retry mechanism:
141: 
142: ```python
143: # Simplified snippet from app/llm.py
144: 
145: from tenacity import retry, wait_random_exponential, stop_after_attempt, retry_if_exception_type
146: from openai import OpenAIError
147: 
148: # ... other imports ...
149: 
150: class LLM:
151:     # ... other methods like __init__, format_messages ...
152: 
153:     @retry( # This decorator handles retries!
154:         wait=wait_random_exponential(min=1, max=60), # Wait 1-60s between tries
155:         stop=stop_after_attempt(6), # Give up after 6 tries
156:         retry=retry_if_exception_type((OpenAIError, Exception)) # Retry on these errors
157:     )
158:     async def ask(
159:         self,
160:         messages: List[Union[dict, Message]],
161:         # ... other parameters ...
162:     ) -> str:
163:         try:
164:             # 1. Format messages (simplified)
165:             formatted_msgs = self.format_messages(messages)
166: 
167:             # 2. Count tokens & Check limits (simplified)
168:             input_tokens = self.count_message_tokens(formatted_msgs)
169:             if not self.check_token_limit(input_tokens):
170:                 raise TokenLimitExceeded(...) # Special error, not retried
171: 
172:             # 3. Prepare API call parameters (simplified)
173:             params = {"model": self.model, "messages": formatted_msgs, ...}
174: 
175:             # 4. Make the actual API call (simplified)
176:             response = await self.client.chat.completions.create(**params)
177: 
178:             # 5. Process response & update tokens (simplified)
179:             answer = response.choices[0].message.content
180:             self.update_token_count(response.usage.prompt_tokens, ...)
181: 
182:             return answer
183:         except TokenLimitExceeded:
184:              raise # Don't retry token limits
185:         except Exception as e:
186:              logger.error(f"LLM ask failed: {e}")
187:              raise # Let the @retry decorator handle retrying other errors
188: ```
189: 
190: **Explanation:**
191: 
192: *   The `@retry(...)` part *above* the `async def ask(...)` line is key. It tells Python: "If the code inside this `ask` function fails with certain errors (like `OpenAIError`), wait a bit and try running it again, up to 6 times."
193: *   Inside the `try...except` block, the code performs the steps we discussed: format, count, check, call the API (`self.client.chat.completions.create`), and process the result.
194: *   Crucially, it catches the `TokenLimitExceeded` error separately and `raise`s it again immediately – we *don't* want to retry if we know we've run out of tokens!
195: *   Other errors will be caught by the final `except Exception`, logged, and re-raised, allowing the `@retry` mechanism to decide whether to try again.
196: 
197: This shows how the `LLM` class uses libraries like `tenacity` to add resilience without cluttering the main logic of your agent.
198: 
199: ## Wrapping Up Chapter 1
200: 
201: You've learned about the core "brain" – the Large Language Model (LLM) – and why we need the `LLM` class in OpenManus to interact with it smoothly. This class acts as a vital interface, handling API complexities, errors, and token counting, providing your agents with simple `ask` (and `ask_tool`) methods.
202: 
203: Now that we understand how to communicate with the LLM, we need a way to structure the conversation – keeping track of who said what. That's where Messages and Memory come in.
204: 
205: Let's move on to [Chapter 2: Message / Memory](02_message___memory.md) to explore how we represent and store conversations for our agents.

 10: In [Chapter 1: The LLM - Your Agent's Brainpower](01_llm.md), we learned how our agent uses the `LLM` class to access its "thinking" capabilities. But just like humans, an agent needs to remember what was said earlier in a conversation to make sense of new requests and respond appropriately.
 11: 
 12: Imagine asking a friend: "What was the first thing I asked you?". If they have no memory, they can't answer! Agents face the same problem. They need a way to store the conversation history.
 13: 
 14: This is where `Message` and `Memory` come in.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Do They Solve?
 17: 
 18: Think about a simple chat:
 19: 
 20: 1.  **You:** "What's the weather like in London?"
 21: 2.  **Agent:** "It's currently cloudy and 15°C in London."
 22: 3.  **You:** "What about Paris?"
 23: 
 24: For the agent to answer your *second* question ("What about Paris?"), it needs to remember that the *topic* of the conversation is "weather". Without remembering the first question, the second question is meaningless.
 25: 
 26: `Message` and `Memory` provide the structure to:
 27: 
 28: 1.  Represent each individual turn (like your question or the agent's answer) clearly.
 29: 2.  Store these turns in order, creating a log of the conversation.
 30: 
 31: ## The Key Concepts: Message and Memory
 32: 
 33: Let's break these down:
 34: 
 35: ### 1. Message: A Single Turn in the Chat
 36: 
 37: A `Message` object is like a single speech bubble in a chat interface. It represents one specific thing said by someone (or something) at a particular point in the conversation.
 38: 
 39: Every `Message` has two main ingredients:
 40: 
 41: *   **`role`**: *Who* sent this message? This is crucial for the LLM to understand the flow. Common roles are:
 42:     *   `user`: A message from the end-user interacting with the agent. (e.g., "What's the weather?")
 43:     *   `assistant`: A message *from* the agent/LLM. (e.g., "The weather is sunny.")
 44:     *   `system`: An initial instruction to guide the agent's overall behavior. (e.g., "You are a helpful weather assistant.")
 45:     *   `tool`: The output or result from a [Tool / ToolCollection](04_tool___toolcollection.md) that the agent used. (e.g., The raw data returned by a weather API tool).
 46: *   **`content`**: *What* was said? This is the actual text of the message. (e.g., "What's the weather like in London?")
 47: 
 48: There are also optional parts for more advanced uses, like `tool_calls` (when the assistant decides to use a tool) or `base64_image` (if an image is included in the message), but `role` and `content` are the basics.
 49: 
 50: ### 2. Memory: The Conversation Log
 51: 
 52: The `Memory` object is simply a container, like a list or a notebook, that holds a sequence of `Message` objects.
 53: 
 54: *   It keeps track of the entire conversation history (or at least the recent parts).
 55: *   It stores messages in the order they occurred.
 56: *   Agents look at the `Memory` before deciding what to do next, giving them context.
 57: 
 58: Think of `Memory` as the agent's short-term memory for the current interaction.
 59: 
 60: ## How Do We Use Them?
 61: 
 62: Let's see how you'd typically work with `Message` and `Memory` in OpenManus (often, the agent framework handles some of this automatically, but it's good to understand the pieces).
 63: 
 64: **1. Creating Messages:**
 65: 
 66: The `Message` class in `app/schema.py` provides handy shortcuts to create messages with the correct role:
 67: 
 68: ```python
 69: # Import the Message class
 70: from app.schema import Message
 71: 
 72: # Create a message from the user
 73: user_q = Message.user_message("What's the capital of France?")
 74: 
 75: # Create a message from the assistant (agent's response)
 76: assistant_a = Message.assistant_message("The capital of France is Paris.")
 77: 
 78: # Create a system instruction
 79: system_instruction = Message.system_message("You are a helpful geography expert.")
 80: 
 81: print(f"User Message: Role='{user_q.role}', Content='{user_q.content}'")
 82: print(f"Assistant Message: Role='{assistant_a.role}', Content='{assistant_a.content}'")
 83: ```
 84: 
 85: **Explanation:**
 86: 
 87: *   We import `Message` from `app/schema.py`.
 88: *   `Message.user_message("...")` creates a `Message` object with `role` set to `user`.
 89: *   `Message.assistant_message("...")` creates one with `role` set to `assistant`.
 90: *   `Message.system_message("...")` creates one with `role` set to `system`.
 91: *   Each of these returns a `Message` object containing the role and the text content you provided.
 92: 
 93: **Example Output:**
 94: 
 95: ```
 96: User Message: Role='user', Content='What's the capital of France?'
 97: Assistant Message: Role='assistant', Content='The capital of France is Paris.'
 98: ```
 99: 
100: **2. Storing Messages in Memory:**
101: 
102: The `Memory` class (`app/schema.py`) holds these messages. Agents usually have a `memory` attribute.
103: 
104: ```python
105: # Import Memory and Message
106: from app.schema import Message, Memory
107: 
108: # Create a Memory instance
109: conversation_memory = Memory()
110: 
111: # Add messages to the memory
112: conversation_memory.add_message(
113:     Message.system_message("You are a helpful geography expert.")
114: )
115: conversation_memory.add_message(
116:     Message.user_message("What's the capital of France?")
117: )
118: conversation_memory.add_message(
119:     Message.assistant_message("The capital of France is Paris.")
120: )
121: conversation_memory.add_message(
122:     Message.user_message("What about Spain?")
123: )
124: 
125: 
126: # See the messages stored
127: print(f"Number of messages in memory: {len(conversation_memory.messages)}")
128: # Print the last message
129: print(f"Last message: {conversation_memory.messages[-1].to_dict()}")
130: ```
131: 
132: **Explanation:**
133: 
134: *   We import `Memory` and `Message`.
135: *   `conversation_memory = Memory()` creates an empty memory store.
136: *   `conversation_memory.add_message(...)` adds a `Message` object to the end of the internal list.
137: *   `conversation_memory.messages` gives you access to the list of `Message` objects currently stored.
138: *   `message.to_dict()` converts a `Message` object into a simple dictionary format, which is often needed for APIs.
139: 
140: **Example Output:**
141: 
142: ```
143: Number of messages in memory: 4
144: Last message: {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What about Spain?'}
145: ```
146: 
147: **3. Using Memory for Context:**
148: 
149: Now, how does the agent use this? Before calling the [LLM](01_llm.md) to figure out the answer to "What about Spain?", the agent would grab the messages from its `Memory`.
150: 
151: ```python
152: # (Continuing from previous example)
153: 
154: # Agent prepares to ask the LLM
155: messages_for_llm = conversation_memory.to_dict_list()
156: 
157: print("Messages being sent to LLM for context:")
158: for msg in messages_for_llm:
159:     print(f"- {msg}")
160: 
161: # Simplified: Agent would now pass 'messages_for_llm' to llm.ask(...)
162: # response = await agent.llm.ask(messages=messages_for_llm)
163: # print(f"LLM would likely respond about the capital of Spain, e.g., 'The capital of Spain is Madrid.'")
164: ```
165: 
166: **Explanation:**
167: 
168: *   `conversation_memory.to_dict_list()` converts all stored `Message` objects into the list-of-dictionaries format that the `llm.ask` method expects (as we saw in Chapter 1).
169: *   By sending this *entire history*, the LLM sees:
170:     1.  Its instructions ("You are a helpful geography expert.")
171:     2.  The first question ("What's the capital of France?")
172:     3.  Its previous answer ("The capital of France is Paris.")
173:     4.  The *new* question ("What about Spain?")
174: *   With this context, the LLM can correctly infer that "What about Spain?" means "What is the capital of Spain?".
175: 
176: ## Under the Hood: How It Works
177: 
178: `Memory` is conceptually simple. It's primarily a wrapper around a standard Python list, ensuring messages are stored correctly and providing convenient methods.
179: 
180: Here's a simplified flow of how an agent uses memory:
181: 
182: ```mermaid
183: sequenceDiagram
184:     participant User
185:     participant Agent as BaseAgent (app/agent/base.py)
186:     participant Mem as Memory (app/schema.py)
187:     participant LLM as LLM Class (app/llm.py)
188:     participant LLM_API as Actual LLM API
189: 
190:     User->>+Agent: Sends message ("What about Spain?")
191:     Agent->>+Mem: update_memory(role="user", content="What about Spain?")
192:     Mem->>Mem: Adds Message(role='user', ...) to internal list
193:     Mem-->>-Agent: Memory updated
194:     Agent->>Agent: Needs to generate response
195:     Agent->>+Mem: Get all messages (memory.messages)
196:     Mem-->>-Agent: Returns list of Message objects
197:     Agent->>Agent: Formats messages to dict list (memory.to_dict_list())
198:     Agent->>+LLM: ask(messages=formatted_list)
199:     LLM->>LLM_API: Sends request with history
200:     LLM_API-->>LLM: Receives response ("The capital is Madrid.")
201:     LLM-->>-Agent: Returns text response
202:     Agent->>+Mem: update_memory(role="assistant", content="The capital is Madrid.")
203:     Mem->>Mem: Adds Message(role='assistant', ...) to internal list
204:     Mem-->>-Agent: Memory updated
205:     Agent->>-User: Sends response ("The capital is Madrid.")
206: 
207: ```
208: 
209: **Code Glimpse:**
210: 
211: Let's look at the core parts in `app/schema.py`:
212: 
213: ```python
214: # Simplified snippet from app/schema.py
215: 
216: from typing import List, Optional
217: from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
218: 
219: # (Role enum and other definitions are here)
220: 
221: class Message(BaseModel):
222:     role: str # Simplified: In reality uses ROLE_TYPE Literal
223:     content: Optional[str] = None
224:     # ... other optional fields like tool_calls, name, etc.
225: 
226:     def to_dict(self) -> dict:
227:         # Creates a dictionary representation, skipping None values
228:         message_dict = {"role": self.role}
229:         if self.content is not None:
230:             message_dict["content"] = self.content
231:         # ... add other fields if they exist ...
232:         return message_dict
233: 
234:     @classmethod
235:     def user_message(cls, content: str) -> "Message":
236:         return cls(role="user", content=content)
237: 
238:     @classmethod
239:     def assistant_message(cls, content: Optional[str]) -> "Message":
240:         return cls(role="assistant", content=content)
241: 
242:     # ... other classmethods like system_message, tool_message ...
243: 
244: class Memory(BaseModel):
245:     messages: List[Message] = Field(default_factory=list)
246:     max_messages: int = 100 # Example limit
247: 
248:     def add_message(self, message: Message) -> None:
249:         """Add a single message to the list."""
250:         self.messages.append(message)
251:         # Optional: Trim old messages if limit exceeded
252:         if len(self.messages) > self.max_messages:
253:             self.messages = self.messages[-self.max_messages :]
254: 
255:     def to_dict_list(self) -> List[dict]:
256:         """Convert all stored messages to dictionaries."""
257:         return [msg.to_dict() for msg in self.messages]
258: 
259:     # ... other methods like clear(), get_recent_messages() ...
260: ```
261: 
262: **Explanation:**
263: 
264: *   The `Message` class uses Pydantic `BaseModel` for structure and validation. It clearly defines `role` and `content`. The classmethods (`user_message`, etc.) are just convenient ways to create instances with the role pre-filled. `to_dict` prepares it for API calls.
265: *   The `Memory` class also uses `BaseModel`. Its main part is `messages: List[Message]`, which holds the conversation history. `add_message` simply appends to this list (and optionally trims it). `to_dict_list` iterates through the stored messages and converts each one using its `to_dict` method.
266: 
267: And here's how an agent might use its memory attribute (simplified from `app/agent/base.py`):
268: 
269: ```python
270: # Simplified conceptual snippet inspired by app/agent/base.py
271: 
272: from app.schema import Memory, Message, ROLE_TYPE # Simplified imports
273: from app.llm import LLM
274: 
275: class SimplifiedAgent:
276:     def __init__(self):
277:         self.memory = Memory() # Agent holds a Memory instance
278:         self.llm = LLM() # Agent has access to the LLM
279: 
280:     def add_user_input(self, text: str):
281:         """Adds user input to memory."""
282:         user_msg = Message.user_message(text)
283:         self.memory.add_message(user_msg)
284:         print(f"Agent Memory Updated with: {user_msg.to_dict()}")
285: 
286:     async def generate_response(self) -> str:
287:         """Generates a response based on memory."""
288:         print("Agent consulting memory...")
289:         messages_for_llm = self.memory.to_dict_list()
290: 
291:         print(f"Sending {len(messages_for_llm)} messages to LLM...")
292:         # The actual call to the LLM
293:         response_text = await self.llm.ask(messages=messages_for_llm)
294: 
295:         # Add assistant response to memory
296:         assistant_msg = Message.assistant_message(response_text)
297:         self.memory.add_message(assistant_msg)
298:         print(f"Agent Memory Updated with: {assistant_msg.to_dict()}")
299: 
300:         return response_text
301: 
302: # Example Usage (needs async context)
303: # agent = SimplifiedAgent()
304: # agent.add_user_input("What is the capital of France?")
305: # response = await agent.generate_response() # Gets "Paris"
306: # agent.add_user_input("What about Spain?")
307: # response2 = await agent.generate_response() # Gets "Madrid"
308: ```
309: 
310: **Explanation:**
311: 
312: *   The agent has `self.memory`.
313: *   When input arrives (`add_user_input`), it creates a `Message` and adds it using `self.memory.add_message`.
314: *   When generating a response (`generate_response`), it retrieves the history using `self.memory.to_dict_list()` and passes it to `self.llm.ask`.
315: *   It then adds the LLM's response back into memory as an `assistant` message.
316: 
317: ## Wrapping Up Chapter 2
318: 
319: You've now learned about `Message` (a single conversational turn with a role and content) and `Memory` (the ordered list storing these messages). Together, they provide the crucial context agents need to understand conversations and respond coherently. They act as the agent's short-term memory or chat log.
320: 
321: We have the brain ([LLM](01_llm.md)) and the memory (`Message`/`Memory`). Now we need something to orchestrate the process – to receive input, consult memory, use the LLM, potentially use tools, and manage its state. That's the job of the Agent itself.
322: 
323: Let's move on to [Chapter 3: BaseAgent](03_baseagent.md) to see how agents are structured and how they use these core components.

  8: # Chapter 3: BaseAgent - The Agent Blueprint
  9: 
 10: In the previous chapters, we learned about the "brain" ([Chapter 1: The LLM](01_llm.md)) that powers our agents and how they remember conversations using [Chapter 2: Message / Memory](02_message___memory.md). Now, let's talk about the agent itself!
 11: 
 12: Imagine you want to build different kinds of digital helpers: one that can browse the web, one that can write code, and maybe one that just answers questions. While they have different jobs, they probably share some basic features, right? They all need a name, a way to remember things, a way to know if they are busy or waiting, and a process to follow when doing their work.
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does `BaseAgent` Solve?
 15: 
 16: Building every agent from scratch, defining these common features over and over again, would be tedious and error-prone. It's like designing a completely new car frame, engine, and wheels every time you want to build a new car model (a sports car, a truck, a sedan). It's inefficient!
 17: 
 18: This is where `BaseAgent` comes in. Think of it as the **master blueprint** or the standard **chassis and engine design** for *all* agents in OpenManus.
 19: 
 20: **Use Case:** Let's say we want to create a simple "EchoAgent" that just repeats back whatever the user says. Even this simple agent needs:
 21: *   A name (e.g., "EchoBot").
 22: *   Memory to store what the user said.
 23: *   A state (is it idle, or is it working on echoing?).
 24: *   A way to run and perform its simple "echo" task.
 25: 
 26: Instead of defining all these basics for EchoAgent, and then again for a "WeatherAgent", and again for a "CodeWriterAgent", we define them *once* in `BaseAgent`.
 27: 
 28: ## Key Concepts: The Building Blocks of an Agent
 29: 
 30: `BaseAgent` (`app/agent/base.py`) defines the fundamental properties and abilities that *all* agents built using OpenManus must have. It ensures consistency and saves us from repeating code. Here are the essential parts:
 31: 
 32: 1.  **`name` (str):** A unique name to identify the agent (e.g., "browser_agent", "code_writer").
 33: 2.  **`description` (Optional[str]):** A short explanation of what the agent does.
 34: 3.  **`state` (AgentState):** The agent's current status. Is it doing nothing (`IDLE`), actively working (`RUNNING`), finished its task (`FINISHED`), or encountered a problem (`ERROR`)?
 35: 4.  **`memory` (Memory):** An instance of the `Memory` class we learned about in [Chapter 2: Message / Memory](02_message___memory.md). This is where the agent stores the conversation history (`Message` objects).
 36: 5.  **`llm` (LLM):** An instance of the `LLM` class from [Chapter 1: The LLM - Your Agent's Brainpower](01_llm.md). This gives the agent access to the language model for "thinking".
 37: 6.  **`run()` method:** The main function you call to start the agent's work. It manages the overall process, like changing the state to `RUNNING` and repeatedly calling the `step()` method.
 38: 7.  **`step()` method:** This is the crucial part! `BaseAgent` defines *that* agents must have a `step` method, but it doesn't say *what* the step does. It's marked as `abstract`, meaning **each specific agent type (like our EchoAgent or a BrowserAgent) must provide its own implementation of `step()`**. This method defines the actual work the agent performs in a single cycle.
 39: 8.  **`max_steps` (int):** A safety limit on how many `step` cycles the agent can run before stopping automatically. This prevents agents from running forever if they get stuck.
 40: 
 41: Think of it like this:
 42: *   `BaseAgent` provides the car chassis (`name`, `state`), the engine (`llm`), the fuel tank (`memory`), and the ignition key (`run()`).
 43: *   The `step()` method is like the specific driving instructions (turn left, accelerate, brake) that make a sports car drive differently from a truck, even though they share the same basic parts.
 44: 
 45: ## How Do We Use `BaseAgent`?
 46: 
 47: You typically don't use `BaseAgent` directly. It's an **abstract** class, meaning it's a template, not a finished product. You **build upon it** by creating new classes that *inherit* from `BaseAgent`.
 48: 
 49: Let's imagine creating our simple `EchoAgent`:
 50: 
 51: ```python
 52: # Conceptual Example - Not runnable code, just for illustration
 53: 
 54: # Import BaseAgent and necessary components
 55: from app.agent.base import BaseAgent
 56: from app.schema import Message
 57: 
 58: class EchoAgent(BaseAgent): # Inherits from BaseAgent!
 59:     """A simple agent that echoes the last user message."""
 60: 
 61:     name: str = "EchoBot"
 62:     description: str = "Repeats the last thing the user said."
 63: 
 64:     # THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART - We implement the abstract 'step' method
 65:     async def step(self) -> str:
 66:         """Perform one step: find the last user message and echo it."""
 67: 
 68:         last_user_message = None
 69:         # Look backwards through memory to find the last user message
 70:         for msg in reversed(self.memory.messages):
 71:             if msg.role == "user":
 72:                 last_user_message = msg
 73:                 break
 74: 
 75:         if last_user_message and last_user_message.content:
 76:             echo_content = f"You said: {last_user_message.content}"
 77:             # Add the echo response to memory as an 'assistant' message
 78:             self.update_memory("assistant", echo_content)
 79:             # The state will be set to FINISHED after this step by run()
 80:             # (Simplified: a real agent might need more complex logic)
 81:             self.state = AgentState.FINISHED # Indicate task is done
 82:             return echo_content # Return the result of this step
 83:         else:
 84:             self.state = AgentState.FINISHED # Nothing to echo, finish
 85:             return "I didn't hear anything from the user to echo."
 86: 
 87: # How you might conceptually use it:
 88: # echo_bot = EchoAgent()
 89: # # Add a user message to its memory
 90: # echo_bot.update_memory("user", "Hello there!")
 91: # # Start the agent's run loop
 92: # result = await echo_bot.run()
 93: # print(result) # Output would contain: "Step 1: You said: Hello there!"
 94: ```
 95: 
 96: **Explanation:**
 97: 
 98: 1.  `class EchoAgent(BaseAgent):` - We declare that `EchoAgent` is a *type of* `BaseAgent`. It automatically gets all the standard parts like `name`, `memory`, `llm`, `state`, and the `run()` method.
 99: 2.  We provide a specific `name` and `description`.
100: 3.  Crucially, we define `async def step(self) -> str:`. This is *our* specific logic for the `EchoAgent`. In this case, it looks through the `memory` (inherited from `BaseAgent`), finds the last user message, and prepares an echo response.
101: 4.  It uses `self.update_memory(...)` (a helper method provided by `BaseAgent`) to add its response to the memory.
102: 5.  It sets its `self.state` to `FINISHED` to signal that its job is done after this one step.
103: 6.  The `run()` method (which we didn't have to write, it's inherited from `BaseAgent`) would handle starting the process, calling our `step()` method, and returning the final result.
104: 
105: This way, we only had to focus on the unique part – the echoing logic inside `step()` – while `BaseAgent` handled the common structure. More complex agents like `BrowserAgent` or `ToolCallAgent` (found in `app/agent/`) follow the same principle but have much more sophisticated `step()` methods, often involving thinking with the [LLM](01_llm.md) and using [Tools](04_tool___toolcollection.md).
106: 
107: ## Under the Hood: The `run()` Loop
108: 
109: What actually happens when you call `agent.run()`? The `BaseAgent` provides a standard execution loop:
110: 
111: 1.  **Check State:** It makes sure the agent is `IDLE` before starting. You can't run an agent that's already running or has finished.
112: 2.  **Set State:** It changes the agent's state to `RUNNING`. It uses a safety mechanism (`state_context`) to ensure the state is handled correctly, even if errors occur.
113: 3.  **Initialize:** If you provided an initial request (e.g., `agent.run("What's the weather?")`), it adds that as the first `user` message to the `memory`.
114: 4.  **Loop:** It enters a loop that continues as long as:
115:     *   The agent hasn't reached its `max_steps` limit.
116:     *   The agent's state is still `RUNNING` (i.e., it hasn't set itself to `FINISHED` or `ERROR` inside its `step()` method).
117: 5.  **Increment Step Counter:** It increases `current_step`.
118: 6.  **Execute `step()`:** This is where it calls the specific `step()` method implemented by the subclass (like our `EchoAgent.step()`). **This is the core of the agent's unique behavior.**
119: 7.  **Record Result:** It stores the string returned by `step()`.
120: 8.  **Repeat:** It goes back to step 4 until the loop condition is false.
121: 9.  **Finalize:** Once the loop finishes (either `max_steps` reached or state changed to `FINISHED`/`ERROR`), it sets the state back to `IDLE` (unless it ended in `ERROR`).
122: 10. **Return Results:** It returns a string summarizing the results from all the steps.
123: 
124: Here's a simplified diagram showing the flow:

154: ## Code Glimpse: Inside `app/agent/base.py`
155: 
156: Let's peek at the `BaseAgent` definition itself.
157: 
158: ```python
159: # Simplified snippet from app/agent/base.py

169:     # Core attributes defined here
170:     name: str = Field(..., description="Unique name")
171:     description: Optional[str] = Field(None)
172:     state: AgentState = Field(default=AgentState.IDLE)
173:     memory: Memory = Field(default_factory=Memory) # Gets a Memory instance
174:     llm: LLM = Field(default_factory=LLM) # Gets an LLM instance
175:     max_steps: int = Field(default=10)
176:     current_step: int = Field(default=0)
177: 
178:     # ... other config and helper methods like update_memory ...
179: 
180:     async def run(self, request: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
181:         """Execute the agent's main loop asynchronously."""
182:         if self.state != AgentState.IDLE:
183:             raise RuntimeError("Agent not IDLE")
184: 
185:         if request:
186:             self.update_memory("user", request) # Add initial request
187: 
188:         results = []
189:         # Simplified: using a context manager for state changes
190:         # async with self.state_context(AgentState.RUNNING):
191:         self.state = AgentState.RUNNING
192:         try:
193:             while (self.current_step < self.max_steps and self.state == AgentState.RUNNING):
194:                 self.current_step += 1
195:                 # ====> THE CORE CALL <====
196:                 step_result = await self.step() # Calls the subclass's step method
197:                 results.append(f"Step {self.current_step}: {step_result}")
198:                 # (Simplified: actual code has more checks)
199:         finally:
200:             # Reset state after loop finishes or if error occurs
201:             if self.state != AgentState.ERROR:
202:                 self.state = AgentState.IDLE
203: 
204:         return "\n".join(results)
205: 
206:     @abstractmethod # Marks this method as needing implementation by subclasses
207:     async def step(self) -> str:
208:         """Execute a single step in the agent's workflow. Must be implemented by subclasses."""
209:         pass # BaseAgent provides no implementation for step()
210: 
211:     def update_memory(self, role: str, content: str, ...) -> None:
212:         """Helper to add messages to self.memory easily."""
213:         # ... implementation uses Message.user_message etc. ...
214:         self.memory.add_message(...)
215: ```
216: 
217: **Explanation:**
218: 
219: *   `class BaseAgent(BaseModel, ABC):` declares it as both a Pydantic model (for data validation) and an Abstract Base Class.
220: *   Fields like `name`, `state`, `memory`, `llm`, `max_steps` are defined. `default_factory=Memory` means each agent gets its own fresh `Memory` instance when created.
221: *   The `run()` method contains the loop logic we discussed, crucially calling `await self.step()`.
222: *   `@abstractmethod` above `async def step(self) -> str:` signals that any class inheriting from `BaseAgent` *must* provide its own version of the `step` method. `BaseAgent` itself just puts `pass` (do nothing) there.
223: *   Helper methods like `update_memory` are provided for convenience.
224: 
225: ## Wrapping Up Chapter 3
226: 
227: We've learned about `BaseAgent`, the fundamental blueprint for all agents in OpenManus. It provides the common structure (`name`, `state`, `memory`, `llm`) and the core execution loop (`run()`), freeing us to focus on the unique logic of each agent by implementing the `step()` method. It acts as the chassis upon which specialized agents are built.
228: 
229: Now that we have the agent structure, how do agents gain specific skills beyond just talking to the LLM? How can they browse the web, run code, or interact with files? They use **Tools**!
230: 
231: Let's move on to [Chapter 4: Tool / ToolCollection](04_tool___toolcollection.md) to explore how we give agents capabilities to interact with the world.

  8: # Chapter 4: Tool / ToolCollection - Giving Your Agent Skills
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 3: BaseAgent - The Agent Blueprint](03_baseagent.md), we learned how `BaseAgent` provides the standard structure for our agents, including a brain ([LLM](01_llm.md)) and memory ([Message / Memory](02_message___memory.md)). But what if we want our agent to do more than just *think* and *remember*? What if we want it to *act* in the world – like searching the web, running code, or editing files?
 11: 
 12: This is where **Tools** come in!
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Do They Solve?
 15: 
 16: Imagine an agent trying to answer the question: "What's the weather like in Tokyo *right now*?"
 17: 
 18: The agent's LLM brain has a lot of general knowledge, but it doesn't have *real-time* access to the internet. It can't check the current weather. It needs a specific **capability** or **skill** to do that.
 19: 
 20: Similarly, if you ask an agent to "Write a python script that prints 'hello world' and save it to a file named `hello.py`," the agent needs the ability to:
 21: 1.  Understand the request (using its LLM).
 22: 2.  Write the code (using its LLM).
 23: 3.  Actually *execute* code to create and write to a file.
 24: 
 25: Steps 1 and 2 are handled by the LLM, but step 3 requires interacting with the computer's file system – something the LLM can't do directly.
 26: 
 27: **Tools** give agents these specific, actionable skills. A `ToolCollection` organizes these skills so the agent knows what it can do.
 28: 
 29: **Use Case:** Let's build towards an agent that can:
 30: 1.  Search the web for today's date.
 31: 2.  Tell the user the date.
 32: 
 33: This agent needs a "Web Search" tool.
 34: 
 35: ## Key Concepts: Tools and Toolboxes
 36: 
 37: Let's break down the two main ideas:
 38: 
 39: ### 1. `BaseTool`: The Blueprint for a Skill
 40: 
 41: Think of `BaseTool` (`app/tool/base.py`) as the *template* or *design specification* for any tool. It doesn't *do* anything itself, but it defines what every tool needs to have:
 42: 
 43: *   **`name` (str):** A short, descriptive name for the tool (e.g., `web_search`, `file_writer`, `code_runner`). This is how the agent (or LLM) identifies the tool.
 44: *   **`description` (str):** A clear explanation of what the tool does, what it's good for, and when to use it. This is crucial for the LLM to decide *which* tool to use for a given task.
 45: *   **`parameters` (dict):** A definition of the inputs the tool expects. For example, a `web_search` tool needs a `query` input, and a `file_writer` needs a `path` and `content`. This is defined using a standard format called JSON Schema.
 46: *   **`execute` method:** An **abstract** method. This means `BaseTool` says "every tool *must* have an execute method", but each specific tool needs to provide its *own* instructions for how to actually perform the action.
 47: 
 48: You almost never use `BaseTool` directly. You use it as a starting point to create *actual*, usable tools.
 49: 
 50: ### 2. Concrete Tools: The Actual Skills
 51: 
 52: These are specific classes that *inherit* from `BaseTool` and provide the real implementation for the `execute` method. OpenManus comes with several pre-built tools:
 53: 
 54: *   **`WebSearch` (`app/tool/web_search.py`):** Searches the web using engines like Google, Bing, etc.
 55: *   **`Bash` (`app/tool/bash.py`):** Executes shell commands (like `ls`, `pwd`, `python script.py`).
 56: *   **`StrReplaceEditor` (`app/tool/str_replace_editor.py`):** Views, creates, and edits files by replacing text.
 57: *   **`BrowserUseTool` (`app/tool/browser_use_tool.py`):** Interacts with web pages like a user (clicking, filling forms, etc.).
 58: *   **`Terminate` (`app/tool/terminate.py`):** A special tool used by agents to signal they have finished their task.
 59: 
 60: Each of these defines its specific `name`, `description`, `parameters`, and implements the `execute` method to perform its unique action.
 61: 
 62: ### 3. `ToolCollection`: The Agent's Toolbox
 63: 
 64: Think of a handyman. They don't just carry one tool; they have a toolbox filled with hammers, screwdrivers, wrenches, etc.
 65: 
 66: A `ToolCollection` (`app/tool/tool_collection.py`) is like that toolbox for an agent.
 67: 
 68: *   It holds a list of specific tool instances (like `WebSearch`, `Bash`).
 69: *   It allows the agent (and its LLM) to see all the available tools and their descriptions.
 70: *   It provides a way to execute a specific tool by its name.
 71: 
 72: When an agent needs to perform an action, its LLM can look at the `ToolCollection`, read the descriptions of the available tools, choose the best one for the job, figure out the necessary inputs based on the tool's `parameters`, and then ask the `ToolCollection` to execute that tool with those inputs.
 73: 
 74: ## How Do We Use Them?
 75: 
 76: Let's see how we can equip an agent with a simple tool. We'll create a basic "EchoTool" first.
 77: 
 78: **1. Creating a Concrete Tool (Inheriting from `BaseTool`):**
 79: 
 80: ```python
 81: # Import the necessary base class
 82: from app.tool.base import BaseTool, ToolResult
 83: 
 84: # Define our simple tool
 85: class EchoTool(BaseTool):
 86:     """A simple tool that echoes the input text."""
 87: 
 88:     name: str = "echo_message"
 89:     description: str = "Repeats back the text provided in the 'message' parameter."
 90:     parameters: dict = {
 91:         "type": "object",
 92:         "properties": {
 93:             "message": {
 94:                 "type": "string",
 95:                 "description": "The text to be echoed back.",
 96:             },
 97:         },
 98:         "required": ["message"], # Tells the LLM 'message' must be provided
 99:     }
100: 
101:     # Implement the actual action
102:     async def execute(self, message: str) -> ToolResult:
103:         """Takes a message and returns it."""
104:         print(f"EchoTool executing with message: '{message}'")
105:         # ToolResult is a standard way to return tool output
106:         return ToolResult(output=f"You said: {message}")
107: 
108: # Create an instance of our tool
109: echo_tool_instance = EchoTool()
110: 
111: print(f"Tool Name: {echo_tool_instance.name}")
112: print(f"Tool Description: {echo_tool_instance.description}")
113: ```
114: 
115: **Explanation:**
116: 
117: *   We import `BaseTool` and `ToolResult` (a standard object for wrapping tool outputs).
118: *   `class EchoTool(BaseTool):` declares that our `EchoTool` *is a type of* `BaseTool`.
119: *   We define the `name`, `description`, and `parameters` according to the `BaseTool` template. The `parameters` structure tells the LLM what input is expected (`message` as a string) and that it's required.
120: *   We implement `async def execute(self, message: str) -> ToolResult:`. This is the *specific* logic for our tool. It takes the `message` input and returns it wrapped in a `ToolResult`.
121: 
122: **Example Output:**
123: 
124: ```
125: Tool Name: echo_message
126: Tool Description: Repeats back the text provided in the 'message' parameter.
127: ```
128: 
129: **2. Creating a ToolCollection:**
130: 
131: Now, let's put our `EchoTool` and the built-in `WebSearch` tool into a toolbox.
132: 
133: ```python
134: # Import ToolCollection and the tools we want
135: from app.tool import ToolCollection, WebSearch
136: # Assume EchoTool class is defined as above
137: # from your_module import EchoTool # Or wherever EchoTool is defined
138: 
139: # Create instances of the tools
140: echo_tool = EchoTool()
141: web_search_tool = WebSearch() # Uses default settings
142: 
143: # Create a ToolCollection containing these tools
144: my_toolbox = ToolCollection(echo_tool, web_search_tool)
145: 
146: # See the names of the tools in the collection
147: tool_names = [tool.name for tool in my_toolbox]
148: print(f"Tools in the toolbox: {tool_names}")
149: 
150: # Get the parameters needed for the LLM
151: tool_params_for_llm = my_toolbox.to_params()
152: print(f"\nParameters for LLM (showing first tool):")
153: import json
154: print(json.dumps(tool_params_for_llm[0], indent=2))
155: ```
156: 
157: **Explanation:**
158: 
159: *   We import `ToolCollection` and the specific tools (`WebSearch`, `EchoTool`).
160: *   We create instances of the tools we need.
161: *   `my_toolbox = ToolCollection(echo_tool, web_search_tool)` creates the collection, holding our tool instances.
162: *   We can access the tools inside using `my_toolbox.tools` or iterate over `my_toolbox`.
163: *   `my_toolbox.to_params()` is a crucial method. It formats the `name`, `description`, and `parameters` of *all* tools in the collection into a list of dictionaries. This specific format is exactly what the agent's [LLM](01_llm.md) needs (when using its `ask_tool` method) to understand which tools are available and how to use them.
164: 
165: **Example Output:**
166: 
167: ```
168: Tools in the toolbox: ['echo_message', 'web_search']
169: 
170: Parameters for LLM (showing first tool):
171: {
172:   "type": "function",
173:   "function": {
174:     "name": "echo_message",
175:     "description": "Repeats back the text provided in the 'message' parameter.",
176:     "parameters": {
177:       "type": "object",
178:       "properties": {
179:         "message": {
180:           "type": "string",
181:           "description": "The text to be echoed back."
182:         }
183:       },
184:       "required": [
185:         "message"
186:       ]
187:     }
188:   }
189: }
190: ```
191: 
192: **3. Agent Using the ToolCollection:**
193: 
194: Now, how does an agent like `ToolCallAgent` (a specific type of [BaseAgent](03_baseagent.md)) use this?
195: 
196: Conceptually (the real agent code is more complex):
197: 
198: 1.  The agent is configured with a `ToolCollection` (like `my_toolbox`).
199: 2.  When the agent needs to figure out the next step, it calls its LLM's `ask_tool` method.
200: 3.  It passes the conversation history ([Message / Memory](02_message___memory.md)) AND the output of `my_toolbox.to_params()` to the LLM.
201: 4.  The LLM looks at the conversation and the list of available tools (from `to_params()`). It reads the `description` of each tool to understand what it does.
202: 5.  If the LLM decides a tool is needed (e.g., the user asked "What's today's date?", the LLM sees the `web_search` tool is available and appropriate), it will generate a special response indicating:
203:     *   The `name` of the tool to use (e.g., `"web_search"`).
204:     *   The `arguments` (inputs) for the tool, based on its `parameters` (e.g., `{"query": "today's date"}`).
205: 6.  The agent receives this response from the LLM.
206: 7.  The agent then uses the `ToolCollection`'s `execute` method: `await my_toolbox.execute(name="web_search", tool_input={"query": "today's date"})`.
207: 8.  The `ToolCollection` finds the `WebSearch` tool instance in its internal `tool_map` and calls *its* `execute` method with the provided input.
208: 9.  The `WebSearch` tool runs, performs the actual web search, and returns the results (as a `ToolResult` or similar).
209: 10. The agent takes this result, formats it as a `tool` message, adds it to its memory, and continues its thinking process (often asking the LLM again, now with the tool's result as context).
210: 
211: The `ToolCollection` acts as the crucial bridge between the LLM's *decision* to use a tool and the *actual execution* of that tool's code.
212: 
213: ## Under the Hood: How `ToolCollection.execute` Works
214: 
215: Let's trace the flow when an agent asks its `ToolCollection` to run a tool:

262:         return [tool.to_param() for tool in self.tools]
263: 
264:     async def execute(
265:         self, *, name: str, tool_input: Dict[str, Any] = None
266:     ) -> ToolResult:
267:         """Finds a tool by name and executes it."""
268:         # 1. Find the tool instance using the name
269:         tool = self.tool_map.get(name)
270:         if not tool:
271:             # Return a standard failure result if tool not found
272:             return ToolFailure(error=f"Tool {name} is invalid")
273: 
274:         # 2. Execute the tool's specific method
275:         try:
276:             # The 'tool(**tool_input)' calls the tool instance's __call__ method,
277:             # which in BaseTool, calls the tool's 'execute' method.
278:             # The ** unpacks the dictionary into keyword arguments.
279:             result = await tool(**(tool_input or {}))
280:             # Ensure the result is a ToolResult (or subclass)
281:             return result if isinstance(result, ToolResult) else ToolResult(output=str(result))
282:         except ToolError as e:
283:              # Handle errors specific to tools
284:             return ToolFailure(error=e.message)
285:         except Exception as e:
286:              # Handle unexpected errors during execution
287:             return ToolFailure(error=f"Unexpected error executing tool {name}: {e}")
288: 
289:     # ... other methods like add_tool, __iter__ ...
290: ```
291: 
292: **Explanation:**
293: 
294: *   The `__init__` method takes tool instances and stores them in `self.tools` (a tuple) and `self.tool_map` (a dictionary mapping name to instance).
295: *   `to_params` iterates through `self.tools` and calls each tool's `to_param()` method (defined in `BaseTool`) to get the LLM-compatible format.
296: *   `execute` is the core method used by agents:
297:     *   It uses `self.tool_map.get(name)` to quickly find the correct tool instance based on the requested name.
298:     *   If found, it calls `await tool(**(tool_input or {}))`. The `**` unpacks the `tool_input` dictionary into keyword arguments for the tool's `execute` method (e.g., `message="hello"` for our `EchoTool`, or `query="today's date"` for `WebSearch`).
299:     *   It wraps the execution in `try...except` blocks to catch errors and return a standardized `ToolFailure` result if anything goes wrong.
300: 
301: ## Wrapping Up Chapter 4
302: 
303: We've learned how **Tools** give agents specific skills beyond basic language understanding.
304: *   `BaseTool` is the abstract blueprint defining a tool's `name`, `description`, and expected `parameters`.
305: *   Concrete tools (like `WebSearch`, `Bash`, or our custom `EchoTool`) inherit from `BaseTool` and implement the actual `execute` logic.
306: *   `ToolCollection` acts as the agent's toolbox, holding various tools and providing methods (`to_params`, `execute`) for the agent (often guided by its [LLM](01_llm.md)) to discover and use these capabilities.
307: 
308: With tools, agents can interact with external systems, run code, access real-time data, and perform complex actions, making them much more powerful.
309: 
310: But how do we coordinate multiple agents, potentially using different tools, to work together on a larger task? That's where Flows come in.
311: 
312: Let's move on to [Chapter 5: BaseFlow](05_baseflow.md) to see how we orchestrate complex workflows involving multiple agents and steps.

  8: # Chapter 5: BaseFlow - Managing Multi-Step Projects
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 4: Tool / ToolCollection](04_tool___toolcollection.md), we saw how to give agents specific skills like web searching or running code using Tools. Now, imagine you have a task that requires multiple steps, maybe even using different skills (tools) or agents along the way. How do you coordinate this complex work?
 11: 
 12: That's where **Flows** come in!
 13: 
 14: ## What Problem Does `BaseFlow` Solve?
 15: 
 16: Think about a simple agent, maybe one equipped with a web search tool. You could ask it, "What's the capital of France?" and it could use its tool and answer "Paris." That's a single-step task.
 17: 
 18: But what if you ask something more complex, like: "Research the pros and cons of electric cars and then write a short blog post summarizing them."
 19: 
 20: This isn't a single action. It involves:
 21: 1.  **Planning:** Figuring out the steps needed (e.g., search for pros, search for cons, structure blog post, write draft, review draft).
 22: 2.  **Executing Step 1:** Using a web search tool to find pros.
 23: 3.  **Executing Step 2:** Using a web search tool to find cons.
 24: 4.  **Executing Step 3:** Maybe using the [LLM](01_llm.md) brain to outline the blog post.
 25: 5.  **Executing Step 4:** Using the LLM to write the post based on the research and outline.
 26: 6.  **Executing Step 5:** Perhaps a final review step.
 27: 
 28: A single [BaseAgent](03_baseagent.md) *might* be able to handle this if it's very sophisticated, but it's often clearer and more manageable to have a dedicated **orchestrator** or **project manager** overseeing the process.
 29: 
 30: **This is the job of a `Flow`.** Specifically, `BaseFlow` is the blueprint for these orchestrators. It defines a structure that can manage multiple agents and coordinate their work to achieve a larger goal according to a specific strategy (like following a pre-defined plan).
 31: 
 32: **Use Case:** Let's stick with our "Research and Write" task. We need something to manage the overall process: first the research, then the writing. A `PlanningFlow` (a specific type of Flow built on `BaseFlow`) is perfect for this. It will first create a plan (like the steps above) and then execute each step, potentially assigning different steps to different specialized agents if needed.
 33: 
 34: ## Key Concepts: Flow, Agents, and Strategy
 35: 
 36: 1.  **`BaseFlow` (`app/flow/base.py`):**
 37:     *   This is the **abstract blueprint** for all flows. Think of it as the job description for a project manager – it says a manager needs to know their team (agents) and have a way to run the project (`execute` method), but it doesn't dictate *how* they manage.
 38:     *   It mainly holds a dictionary of available `agents` that can be used within the flow.
 39:     *   You don't use `BaseFlow` directly; you use specific implementations.
 40: 
 41: 2.  **Concrete Flows (e.g., `PlanningFlow` in `app/flow/planning.py`):**
 42:     *   These are the **specific strategies** for managing the project. They *inherit* from `BaseFlow`.
 43:     *   `PlanningFlow` is a key example. Its strategy is:
 44:         1.  Receive the overall goal.
 45:         2.  Use an LLM and a special `PlanningTool` to break the goal down into a sequence of steps (the "plan").
 46:         3.  Execute each step in the plan, one by one, usually by calling the `run()` method of an appropriate [BaseAgent](03_baseagent.md).
 47:         4.  Track the status of each step (e.g., not started, in progress, completed).
 48: 
 49: 3.  **Agents within the Flow:**
 50:     *   These are the "workers" or "specialists" managed by the flow.
 51:     *   A flow holds one or more [BaseAgent](03_baseagent.md) instances.
 52:     *   In a `PlanningFlow`, one agent might be designated as the primary agent (often responsible for helping create the plan), while others (or maybe the same one) act as "executors" for the plan steps. The flow decides which agent is best suited for each step.
 53: 
 54: Think of it like building a house:
 55: *   `BaseFlow` is the concept of a "General Contractor".
 56: *   `PlanningFlow` is a specific *type* of General Contractor who always starts by creating a detailed architectural plan and then hires specialists for each phase.
 57: *   The `agents` are the specialists: the plumber, the electrician, the carpenter, etc.
 58: *   The overall goal ("Build a house") is given to the `PlanningFlow` (Contractor).
 59: *   The `PlanningFlow` creates the plan (foundation, framing, plumbing, electrical...).
 60: *   The `PlanningFlow` then calls the appropriate `agent` (specialist) for each step in the plan.
 61: 
 62: ## How Do We Use Flows?
 63: 
 64: You typically use a `FlowFactory` to create a specific type of flow, providing it with the agents it needs.
 65: 
 66: Let's set up a simple `PlanningFlow` with one agent called "Manus" (which is a general-purpose agent in OpenManus).
 67: 
 68: ```python
 69: # Import necessary classes
 70: from app.agent.manus import Manus # A capable agent
 71: from app.flow.flow_factory import FlowFactory, FlowType
 72: import asyncio # Needed for async execution
 73: 
 74: # 1. Create the agent(s) we want the flow to manage
 75: # We can give agents specific keys (names) within the flow
 76: agents_for_flow = {
 77:     "research_writer": Manus() # Use Manus agent for all tasks
 78: }
 79: 
 80: # 2. Create the flow using the factory
 81: # We specify the type (PLANNING) and provide the agents
 82: planning_flow_instance = FlowFactory.create_flow(
 83:     flow_type=FlowType.PLANNING,
 84:     agents=agents_for_flow,
 85:     # Optional: specify which agent is primary (if not first)
 86:     # primary_agent_key="research_writer"
 87: )
 88: 
 89: print(f"Created a {type(planning_flow_instance).__name__}")
 90: print(f"Primary agent: {planning_flow_instance.primary_agent.name}")
 91: 
 92: # 3. Define the overall goal for the flow
 93: overall_goal = "Research the main benefits of solar power and write a short summary."
 94: 
 95: # Define an async function to run the flow
 96: async def run_the_flow():
 97:     print(f"\nExecuting flow with goal: '{overall_goal}'")
 98:     # 4. Execute the flow with the goal
 99:     final_result = await planning_flow_instance.execute(overall_goal)
100:     print("\n--- Flow Execution Finished ---")
101:     print(f"Final Result:\n{final_result}")
102: 
103: # Run the async function
104: # asyncio.run(run_the_flow()) # Uncomment to run
105: ```
106: 
107: **Explanation:**
108: 
109: 1.  We import the agent we want to use (`Manus`) and the `FlowFactory` plus `FlowType`.
110: 2.  We create a dictionary `agents_for_flow` mapping a key ("research\_writer") to an instance of our `Manus` agent. This tells the flow which workers are available.
111: 3.  We use `FlowFactory.create_flow()` specifying `FlowType.PLANNING` and passing our `agents_for_flow`. The factory handles constructing the `PlanningFlow` object correctly.
112: 4.  We define the high-level task (`overall_goal`).
113: 5.  We call `await planning_flow_instance.execute(overall_goal)`. This is where the magic happens! The `PlanningFlow` takes over.
114: 
115: **Expected Outcome (High Level):**
116: 
117: When you run this (if uncommented), you won't just get an immediate answer. You'll likely see output indicating:
118: *   A plan is being created (e.g., Step 1: Search for benefits, Step 2: Synthesize findings, Step 3: Write summary).
119: *   The agent ("research\_writer") starting to execute Step 1. This might involve output from the agent using its web search tool.
120: *   The agent moving on to Step 2, then Step 3, potentially showing LLM thinking or writing output.
121: *   Finally, the `execute` call will return a string containing the results of the steps and possibly a final summary generated by the flow or the agent.
122: 
123: The `PlanningFlow` manages this entire multi-step process automatically based on the initial goal.
124: 
125: ## Under the Hood: How `PlanningFlow.execute` Works
126: 
127: Let's peek behind the curtain of the `PlanningFlow`'s `execute` method. What happens when you call it?
128: 
129: **High-Level Walkthrough:**
130: 
131: 1.  **Receive Goal:** The `execute` method gets the `input_text` (our overall goal).
132: 2.  **Create Plan (`_create_initial_plan`):**
133:     *   It constructs messages for the [LLM](01_llm.md), including a system message asking it to act as a planner.
134:     *   It tells the LLM about the `PlanningTool` (a special [Tool](04_tool___toolcollection.md) designed for creating and managing plans).
135:     *   It calls the LLM's `ask_tool` method, essentially asking: "Please use the PlanningTool to create a plan for this goal: *{input\_text}*".
136:     *   The `PlanningTool` (when called by the LLM) stores the generated steps (e.g., ["Search benefits", "Write summary"]) associated with a unique `plan_id`.
137: 3.  **Execution Loop:** The flow enters a loop to execute the plan steps.
138:     *   **Get Next Step (`_get_current_step_info`):** It checks the stored plan (using the `PlanningTool`) to find the first step that isn't marked as "completed". It gets the step's text and index.
139:     *   **Check for Completion:** If no non-completed steps are found, the plan is finished! The loop breaks.
140:     *   **Select Executor (`get_executor`):** It determines which agent should perform the current step. In our simple example, it will always select our "research\_writer" agent. More complex flows could choose based on step type (e.g., a "[CODE]" step might go to a coding agent).
141:     *   **Execute Step (`_execute_step`):**
142:         *   It prepares a prompt for the selected executor agent, including the current plan status and the specific instruction for the current step (e.g., "You are working on step 0: 'Search benefits'. Please execute this step.").
143:         *   It calls the executor agent's `run()` method with this prompt: `await executor.run(step_prompt)`. The agent then does its work (which might involve using its own tools, memory, and LLM).
144:         *   It gets the result back from the agent's `run()`.
145:     *   **Mark Step Complete (`_mark_step_completed`):** It tells the `PlanningTool` to update the status of the current step to "completed".
146:     *   **Loop:** Go back to find the next step.
147: 4.  **Finalize (`_finalize_plan`):** Once the loop finishes, it might generate a final summary of the completed plan (potentially using the LLM again).
148: 5.  **Return Result:** The accumulated results from executing all the steps are returned as a string.

348: 
349: **Explanation of Snippets:**
350: 
351: *   `BaseFlow` defines the `agents` dictionary and the abstract `execute` method.
352: *   `FlowFactory` looks at the requested `FlowType` and returns an instance of the corresponding class (`PlanningFlow`).
353: *   `PlanningFlow.execute` orchestrates the overall process: create plan, loop through steps, get executor, execute step via `agent.run()`, mark complete.
354: *   `_create_initial_plan` shows interaction with the [LLM](01_llm.md) and the `PlanningTool` to generate the initial steps.
355: *   `_execute_step` shows how the flow prepares a prompt and then delegates the actual work for a specific step to an agent by calling `executor.run()`.
356: *   `_mark_step_completed` updates the plan state using the `PlanningTool`.
357: 
358: ## Wrapping Up Chapter 5
359: 
360: We've seen that `BaseFlow` provides a way to manage complex, multi-step tasks that might involve multiple agents or tools. It acts as an orchestrator or project manager. We focused on `PlanningFlow`, a specific strategy where a plan is created first, and then each step is executed sequentially by designated agents. This allows OpenManus to tackle much larger and more complex goals than a single agent could handle alone.
361: 
362: So far, we've covered the core components: LLMs, Memory, Agents, Tools, and Flows. But how do we define the structure of data that these components pass around, like the format of tool parameters or agent configurations? That's where schemas come in.
363: 
364: Let's move on to [Chapter 6: Schema](06_schema.md) to understand how OpenManus defines and validates data structures.

  8: # Chapter 6: Schema - The Official Data Forms
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 5: BaseFlow](05_baseflow.md), we saw how Flows act like project managers, coordinating different [Agents](03_baseagent.md) and [Tools](04_tool___toolcollection.md) to complete complex tasks. But for all these different parts (Flows, Agents, LLMs, Tools) to work together smoothly, they need to speak the same language and use the same formats when exchanging information.
 11: 
 12: Imagine a busy office where everyone fills out forms for requests, reports, and messages. If everyone uses their *own* unique form layout, it quickly becomes chaotic! Someone might forget a required field, use the wrong data type (like writing "yesterday" instead of a specific date), or mislabel information. It would be incredibly hard to process anything efficiently.
 13: 
 14: This is where **Schemas** come into play in OpenManus.
 15: 
 16: ## What Problem Does Schema Solve?
 17: 
 18: In our digital "office" (the OpenManus application), various components need to pass data back and forth:
 19: *   The User sends a request (a message).
 20: *   The Agent stores this message in its [Memory](02_message___memory.md).
 21: *   The Agent might ask the [LLM](01_llm.md) for help, sending the conversation history.
 22: *   The LLM might decide to use a [Tool](04_tool___toolcollection.md), sending back instructions on which tool and what inputs to use.
 23: *   The Tool executes and sends back its results.
 24: *   The Agent updates its status (e.g., from `RUNNING` to `FINISHED`).
 25: 
 26: Without a standard way to structure all this information, we'd face problems:
 27: *   **Inconsistency:** One part might expect a user message to have a `sender` field, while another expects a `role` field.
 28: *   **Errors:** A Tool might expect a number as input but receive text, causing it to crash.
 29: *   **Confusion:** It would be hard for developers (and the system itself!) to know exactly what information is contained in a piece of data.
 30: *   **Maintenance Nightmares:** Changing how data is structured in one place could break many other parts unexpectedly.
 31: 
 32: **Schemas solve this by defining the official "forms" or "templates" for all the important data structures used in OpenManus.** Think of them as the agreed-upon standard formats that everyone must use.
 33: 
 34: **Use Case:** When the LLM decides the agent should use the `web_search` tool with the query "latest AI news", it doesn't just send back a vague text string. It needs to send structured data that clearly says:
 35: 1.  "I want to call a tool."
 36: 2.  "The tool's name is `web_search`."
 37: 3.  "The input parameter `query` should be set to `latest AI news`."
 38: 
 39: A schema defines exactly how this "tool call request" should look, ensuring the Agent understands it correctly.
 40: 
 41: ## Key Concepts: Standard Templates via Pydantic
 42: 
 43: 1.  **Schema as Templates:** At its core, a schema is a formal definition of a data structure. It specifies:
 44:     *   What pieces of information (fields) must be included (e.g., a `Message` must have a `role`).
 45:     *   What type each piece of information should be (e.g., `role` must be text, `current_step` in an Agent must be a number).
 46:     *   Which fields are optional and which are required.
 47:     *   Sometimes, default values or specific allowed values (e.g., `role` must be one of "user", "assistant", "system", or "tool").
 48: 
 49: 2.  **Pydantic: The Schema Engine:** OpenManus uses a popular Python library called **Pydantic** to define and enforce these schemas. You don't need to be a Pydantic expert, but understanding its role is helpful. Pydantic lets us define these data structures using simple Python classes. When data is loaded into these classes, Pydantic automatically:
 50:     *   **Validates** the data: Checks if all required fields are present and if the data types are correct. If not, it raises an error *before* the bad data can cause problems elsewhere.
 51:     *   **Provides Auto-completion and Clarity:** Because the structure is clearly defined in code, developers get better auto-completion hints in their editors, making the code easier to write and understand.
 52: 
 53: Think of Pydantic as the strict office manager who checks every form submitted, ensuring it's filled out correctly according to the official template before passing it on.
 54: 
 55: ## How Do We Use Schemas? (Examples)
 56: 
 57: Schemas are defined throughout the OpenManus codebase, primarily as Pydantic models. You've already encountered some! Let's look at a few key examples found mostly in `app/schema.py` and `app/tool/base.py`.
 58: 
 59: **1. `Message` (from `app/schema.py`): The Chat Bubble**
 60: 
 61: We saw this in [Chapter 2: Message / Memory](02_message___memory.md). It defines the structure for a single turn in a conversation.
 62: 
 63: ```python
 64: # Simplified Pydantic model from app/schema.py
 65: from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
 66: from typing import List, Optional, Literal
 67: 
 68: # Define allowed roles
 69: ROLE_TYPE = Literal["system", "user", "assistant", "tool"]
 70: 
 71: class Message(BaseModel):
 72:     role: ROLE_TYPE = Field(...) # '...' means this field is required
 73:     content: Optional[str] = Field(default=None) # Optional text content
 74:     # ... other optional fields like tool_calls, name, tool_call_id ...
 75: 
 76:     # Class methods like user_message, assistant_message are here...
 77: ```
 78: 
 79: **Explanation:**
 80: *   This Pydantic class `Message` defines the "form" for a message.
 81: *   `role: ROLE_TYPE = Field(...)` means every message *must* have a `role`, and its value must be one of the strings defined in `ROLE_TYPE`. Pydantic enforces this.
 82: *   `content: Optional[str] = Field(default=None)` means a message *can* have text `content`, but it's optional. If not provided, it defaults to `None`.
 83: *   Pydantic ensures that if you try to create a `Message` object without a valid `role`, or with `content` that isn't a string, you'll get an error immediately.
 84: 
 85: **2. `ToolCall` and `Function` (from `app/schema.py`): The Tool Request Form**
 86: 
 87: When the LLM tells the agent to use a tool, it sends back data structured according to the `ToolCall` schema.
 88: 
 89: ```python
 90: # Simplified Pydantic models from app/schema.py
 91: from pydantic import BaseModel
 92: 
 93: class Function(BaseModel):
 94:     name: str      # The name of the tool/function to call
 95:     arguments: str # The input arguments as a JSON string
 96: 
 97: class ToolCall(BaseModel):
 98:     id: str              # A unique ID for this specific call
 99:     type: str = "function" # Currently always "function"
100:     function: Function   # Embeds the Function details above
101: ```
102: 
103: **Explanation:**
104: *   The `Function` schema defines that we need the `name` of the tool (as text) and its `arguments` (also as text, expected to be formatted as JSON).
105: *   The `ToolCall` schema includes a unique `id`, the `type` (always "function" for now), and embeds the `Function` data.
106: *   This ensures that whenever the agent receives a tool call instruction from the LLM, it knows exactly where to find the tool's name and arguments, preventing guesswork and errors.
107: 
108: **3. `AgentState` (from `app/schema.py`): The Agent Status Report**
109: 
110: We saw this in [Chapter 3: BaseAgent](03_baseagent.md). It standardizes how we represent the agent's current status.
111: 
112: ```python
113: # Simplified definition from app/schema.py
114: from enum import Enum
115: 
116: class AgentState(str, Enum):
117:     """Agent execution states"""
118:     IDLE = "IDLE"
119:     RUNNING = "RUNNING"
120:     FINISHED = "FINISHED"
121:     ERROR = "ERROR"
122: ```
123: 
124: **Explanation:**
125: *   This uses Python's `Enum` (Enumeration) type, which is automatically compatible with Pydantic.
126: *   It defines a fixed set of allowed values for the agent's state. An agent's state *must* be one of these four strings.
127: *   This prevents typos (like "Runing" or "Idle") and makes it easy to check the agent's status reliably.
128: 
129: **4. `ToolResult` (from `app/tool/base.py`): The Tool Output Form**
130: 
131: When a [Tool](04_tool___toolcollection.md) finishes its job, it needs to report back its findings in a standard way.
132: 
133: ```python
134: # Simplified Pydantic model from app/tool/base.py
135: from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
136: from typing import Any, Optional
137: 
138: class ToolResult(BaseModel):
139:     """Represents the result of a tool execution."""
140:     output: Any = Field(default=None)          # The main result data
141:     error: Optional[str] = Field(default=None) # Error message, if any
142:     # ... other optional fields like base64_image, system message ...
143: 
144:     class Config:
145:         arbitrary_types_allowed = True # Allows 'Any' type for output
146: ```
147: 
148: **Explanation:**
149: *   Defines a standard structure for *any* tool's output.
150: *   It includes an `output` field for the successful result (which can be of `Any` type, allowing flexibility for different tools) and an optional `error` field to report problems.
151: *   Specific tools might *inherit* from `ToolResult` to add more specific fields, like `SearchResult` adding `url`, `title`, etc. (see `app/tool/web_search.py`). Using `ToolResult` as a base ensures all tool outputs have a consistent minimum structure.
152: 
153: ## Under the Hood: Pydantic Validation
154: 
155: The real power of using Pydantic for schemas comes from its automatic data validation. Let's illustrate with a simplified `Message` example.
156: 
157: Imagine you have this Pydantic model:
158: 
159: ```python
160: # Standalone Example (Illustrative)
161: from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError
162: from typing import Literal
163: 
164: ROLE_TYPE = Literal["user", "assistant"] # Only allow these roles
165: 
166: class SimpleMessage(BaseModel):
167:     role: ROLE_TYPE
168:     content: str
169: ```
170: 
171: Now, let's see what happens when we try to create instances:
172: 
173: ```python
174: # --- Valid Data ---
175: try:
176:     msg1 = SimpleMessage(role="user", content="Hello there!")
177:     print("msg1 created successfully:", msg1.model_dump()) # .model_dump() shows dict
178: except ValidationError as e:
179:     print("Error creating msg1:", e)
180: 
181: # --- Missing Required Field ('content') ---
182: try:
183:     msg2 = SimpleMessage(role="assistant")
184:     print("msg2 created successfully:", msg2.model_dump())
185: except ValidationError as e:
186:     print("\nError creating msg2:")
187:     print(e) # Pydantic gives a detailed error
188: 
189: # --- Invalid Role ---
190: try:
191:     msg3 = SimpleMessage(role="system", content="System message") # 'system' is not allowed
192:     print("msg3 created successfully:", msg3.model_dump())
193: except ValidationError as e:
194:     print("\nError creating msg3:")
195:     print(e) # Pydantic catches the wrong role
196: 
197: # --- Wrong Data Type for 'content' ---
198: try:
199:     msg4 = SimpleMessage(role="user", content=123) # content should be string
200:     print("msg4 created successfully:", msg4.model_dump())
201: except ValidationError as e:
202:     print("\nError creating msg4:")
203:     print(e) # Pydantic catches the type error
204: ```
205: 
206: **Example Output:**
207: 
208: ```
209: msg1 created successfully: {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello there!'}
210: 
211: Error creating msg2:
212: 1 validation error for SimpleMessage
213: content
214:   Field required [type=missing, input_value={'role': 'assistant'}, input_type=dict]
215:     For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.7/v/missing
216: 
217: Error creating msg3:
218: 1 validation error for SimpleMessage
219: role
220:   Input should be 'user' or 'assistant' [type=literal_error, input_value='system', input_type=str]
221:     For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.7/v/literal_error
222: 
223: Error creating msg4:
224: 1 validation error for SimpleMessage
225: content
226:   Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=123, input_type=int]
227:     For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.7/v/string_type
228: ```
229: 
230: **Explanation:**
231: *   When the data matches the schema (`msg1`), the object is created successfully.
232: *   When data is missing (`msg2`), has an invalid value (`msg3`), or the wrong type (`msg4`), Pydantic automatically raises a `ValidationError`.
233: *   The error message clearly explains *what* is wrong and *where*.
234: 
235: This validation happens automatically whenever data is loaded into these Pydantic models within OpenManus, catching errors early and ensuring data consistency across the entire application. You mostly find these schema definitions in `app/schema.py`, but also within specific tool files (like `app/tool/base.py`, `app/tool/web_search.py`) for their specific results.
236: 
237: ## Wrapping Up Chapter 6
238: 
239: You've learned that **Schemas** are like official data templates or forms used throughout OpenManus. They define the expected structure for important data like messages, tool calls, agent states, and tool results. By using the **Pydantic** library, OpenManus automatically **validates** data against these schemas, ensuring consistency, preventing errors, and making the whole system more reliable and easier to understand. They are the backbone of structured communication between different components.
240: 
241: We've now covered most of the core functional building blocks of OpenManus. But how do we configure things like which LLM model to use, API keys, or which tools an agent should have? That's handled by the Configuration system.
242: 
243: Let's move on to [Chapter 7: Configuration (Config)](07_configuration__config_.md) to see how we manage settings and secrets for our agents and flows.

  8: # Chapter 7: Configuration (Config)
  9: 
 10: Welcome to Chapter 7! In [Chapter 6: Schema](06_schema.md), we learned how OpenManus uses schemas to define the structure of data passed between different components, like official forms ensuring everyone fills them out correctly.
 11: 
 12: Now, think about setting up a new application. You often need to tell it *how* to behave.
 13: *   Which AI model should it use?
 14: *   What's the secret key to access that AI?
 15: *   Should it run code in a restricted "sandbox" environment?
 16: *   Which search engine should it prefer?
 17: 
 18: These are all **settings** or **configurations**. This chapter explores how OpenManus manages these settings using the `Config` system.
 19: 
 20: ## What Problem Does Config Solve?
 21: 
 22: Imagine you're building a simple app that uses an AI service. You need an API key to access it. Where do you put this key?
 23: 
 24: *   **Option 1: Hardcode it directly in the code.**
 25:     ```python
 26:     # Bad idea! Don't do this!
 27:     api_key = "MY_SUPER_SECRET_API_KEY_12345"
 28:     # ... rest of the code uses api_key ...
 29:     ```
 30:     This is a terrible idea! Your secret key is exposed in the code. Sharing the code means sharing your secret. Changing the key means editing the code. What if multiple parts of the code need the key? You'd have it scattered everywhere!
 31: 
 32: *   **Option 2: Use a Configuration System.**
 33:     Keep all settings in a separate, easy-to-read file. The application reads this file when it starts and makes the settings available wherever they're needed.
 34: 
 35: OpenManus uses Option 2. It keeps settings in a file named `config.toml` and uses a special `Config` object to manage them.
 36: 
 37: **Use Case:** Let's say we want our [LLM](01_llm.md) component to use the "gpt-4o" model and a specific API key. Instead of writing "gpt-4o" and the key directly into the `LLM` class code, the `LLM` class will *ask* the `Config` system: "What model should I use?" and "What's the API key?". The `Config` system provides the answers it read from `config.toml`.
 38: 
 39: ## Key Concepts: The Settings File and Manager
 40: 
 41: ### 1. The Settings File (`config.toml`)
 42: 
 43: This is a simple text file located in the `config/` directory of your OpenManus project. It uses the TOML format (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language), which is designed to be easy for humans to read.
 44: 
 45: It contains sections for different parts of the application. Here's a highly simplified snippet:
 46: 
 47: ```toml
 48: # config/config.toml (Simplified Example)
 49: 
 50: [llm] # Settings for the Large Language Model
 51: model = "gpt-4o"
 52: api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE" # Replace with your actual key
 53: base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
 54: api_type = "openai"
 55: 
 56: [sandbox] # Settings for the code execution sandbox
 57: use_sandbox = true
 58: image = "python:3.12-slim"
 59: memory_limit = "256m"
 60: 
 61: [search_config] # Settings for web search
 62: engine = "DuckDuckGo"
 63: 
 64: [browser_config] # Settings for the browser tool
 65: headless = false
 66: ```
 67: 
 68: **Explanation:**
 69: *   `[llm]`, `[sandbox]`, etc., define sections.
 70: *   `model = "gpt-4o"` assigns the value `"gpt-4o"` to the `model` setting within the `llm` section.
 71: *   `api_key = "YOUR_..."` stores your secret key (you should put your real key here and **never** share this file publicly if it contains secrets!).
 72: *   `use_sandbox = true` sets a boolean (true/false) value.
 73: 
 74: This file acts as the central "control panel" list for the application's behavior.
 75: 
 76: ### 2. The Settings Manager (`Config` class in `app/config.py`)
 77: 
 78: Okay, we have the settings file. How does the application *use* it?
 79: 
 80: OpenManus has a special Python class called `Config` (defined in `app/config.py`). Think of this class as the **Settings Manager**. Its job is:
 81: 
 82: 1.  **Read the File:** When the application starts, the `Config` manager reads the `config.toml` file.
 83: 2.  **Parse and Store:** It understands the TOML format and stores the settings internally, often using the Pydantic [Schemas](06_schema.md) we learned about (like `LLMSettings`, `SandboxSettings`) to validate the data.
 84: 3.  **Provide Access:** It offers a way for any other part of the application to easily ask for a specific setting (e.g., "Give me the LLM model name").
 85: 
 86: ### 3. The Singleton Pattern: One Manager to Rule Them All
 87: 
 88: The `Config` class uses a special design pattern called a **Singleton**. This sounds fancy, but the idea is simple: **There is only ever *one* instance (object) of the `Config` manager in the entire application.**
 89: 
 90: *Analogy:* Think of the principal's office in a school. There's only one principal's office. If any teacher or student needs official school-wide information (like the date of the next holiday), they go to that single, central office. They don't each have their own separate, potentially conflicting, information source.
 91: 
 92: The `Config` object is like that principal's office. When any part of OpenManus (like the [LLM](01_llm.md) class or the [DockerSandbox](08_dockersandbox.md) class) needs a setting, it asks the *same*, single `Config` instance. This ensures everyone is using the same configuration values that were loaded at the start.
 93: 
 94: ## How Do We Use It? (Accessing Settings)
 95: 
 96: Because `Config` is a singleton, accessing settings is straightforward. You import the pre-created instance and ask for the setting you need.
 97: 
 98: The single instance is created automatically when `app/config.py` is first loaded and is made available as `config`.
 99: 
100: ```python
101: # Example of how another part of the code might use the config
102: from app.config import config # Import the singleton instance
103: 
104: # Access LLM settings
105: default_llm_settings = config.llm.get("default") # Get the 'default' LLM config
106: if default_llm_settings:
107:     model_name = default_llm_settings.model
108:     api_key = default_llm_settings.api_key
109:     print(f"LLM Model: {model_name}")
110:     # Don't print the API key in real code! This is just for illustration.
111:     # print(f"LLM API Key: {api_key[:4]}...{api_key[-4:]}")
112: 
113: # Access Sandbox settings
114: use_sandbox_flag = config.sandbox.use_sandbox
115: sandbox_image = config.sandbox.image
116: print(f"Use Sandbox: {use_sandbox_flag}")
117: print(f"Sandbox Image: {sandbox_image}")
118: 
119: # Access Search settings (check if it exists)
120: if config.search_config:
121:     search_engine = config.search_config.engine
122:     print(f"Preferred Search Engine: {search_engine}")
123: 
124: # Access Browser settings (check if it exists)
125: if config.browser_config:
126:     run_headless = config.browser_config.headless
127:     print(f"Run Browser Headless: {run_headless}")
128: ```
129: 
130: **Explanation:**
131: 
132: 1.  `from app.config import config`: We import the single, shared `config` object.
133: 2.  `config.llm`: Accesses the dictionary of all LLM configurations read from the `[llm]` sections in `config.toml`. We use `.get("default")` to get the settings specifically for the LLM named "default".
134: 3.  `default_llm_settings.model`: Accesses the `model` attribute of the `LLMSettings` object. Pydantic ensures this attribute exists and is the correct type.
135: 4.  `config.sandbox.use_sandbox`: Directly accesses the `use_sandbox` attribute within the `sandbox` settings object (`SandboxSettings`).
136: 5.  We check if `config.search_config` and `config.browser_config` exist before accessing them, as they might be optional sections in the `config.toml` file.
137: 
138: **Use Case Example: How `LLM` Gets Its Settings**
139: 
140: Let's revisit our use case. When an `LLM` object is created (often inside a [BaseAgent](03_baseagent.md)), its initialization code (`__init__`) looks something like this (simplified):
141: 
142: ```python
143: # Simplified snippet from app/llm.py __init__ method
144: 
145: from app.config import config, LLMSettings # Import config and the schema
146: from typing import Optional
147: 
148: class LLM:
149:     # ... other methods ...
150:     def __init__(self, config_name: str = "default", llm_config: Optional[LLMSettings] = None):
151:         # If specific llm_config isn't provided, get it from the global config
152:         if llm_config is None:
153:             # Ask the global 'config' object for the settings
154:             # corresponding to 'config_name' (e.g., "default")
155:             llm_settings = config.llm.get(config_name)
156:             if not llm_settings: # Handle case where the name doesn't exist
157:                  llm_settings = config.llm.get("default") # Fallback to default
158: 
159:         else: # Use the provided config if given
160:             llm_settings = llm_config
161: 
162: 
163:         # Store the settings read from the config object
164:         self.model = llm_settings.model
165:         self.api_key = llm_settings.api_key
166:         self.base_url = llm_settings.base_url
167:         # ... store other settings like max_tokens, temperature ...
168: 
169:         print(f"LLM initialized with model: {self.model}")
170:         # Initialize the actual API client using these settings
171:         # self.client = AsyncOpenAI(api_key=self.api_key, base_url=self.base_url)
172:         # ... rest of initialization ...
173: ```
174: 
175: **Explanation:**
176: *   The `LLM` class imports the global `config` object.
177: *   In its `__init__`, it uses `config.llm.get(config_name)` to retrieve the specific settings (like `model`, `api_key`) it needs.
178: *   It then uses these retrieved values to configure itself and the underlying API client.
179: 
180: This way, the `LLM` class doesn't need the actual values hardcoded inside it. It just asks the central `Config` manager. If you want to change the model or API key, you only need to update `config.toml` and restart the application!
181: 
182: ## Under the Hood: Loading and Providing Settings
183: 
184: What happens when the application starts and the `config` object is first used?
185: 
186: 1.  **First Access:** The first time code tries to `import config` from `app.config`, Python runs the code in `app.config.py`.
187: 2.  **Singleton Check:** The `Config` class's special `__new__` method checks if an instance (`_instance`) already exists. If not, it creates a new one. If it *does* exist, it just returns the existing one. This ensures only one instance is ever made.
188: 3.  **Initialization (`__init__`):** The `__init__` method (run only once for the single instance) calls `_load_initial_config`.
189: 4.  **Find File (`_get_config_path`):** It looks for `config/config.toml`. If that doesn't exist, it looks for `config/config.example.toml` as a fallback.
190: 5.  **Read File (`_load_config`):** It opens the found `.toml` file and uses the standard `tomllib` library to read its contents into a Python dictionary.
191: 6.  **Parse & Validate:** `_load_initial_config` takes this raw dictionary and carefully organizes it, using Pydantic models (`LLMSettings`, `SandboxSettings`, `BrowserSettings`, `SearchSettings`, `MCPSettings`, all defined in `app/config.py`) to structure and *validate* the settings. For example, it creates `LLMSettings` objects for each entry under `[llm]`. If a required setting is missing or has the wrong type (e.g., `max_tokens` is text instead of a number), Pydantic will raise an error here, stopping the app from starting with bad configuration.
192: 7.  **Store Internally:** The validated settings (now nicely structured Pydantic objects) are stored within the `Config` instance (in `self._config`).
193: 8.  **Ready for Use:** The `config` instance is now ready. Subsequent accesses simply return the stored, validated settings via properties like `config.llm`, `config.sandbox`, etc.

310: config = Config()
311: ```
312: 
313: **Explanation:**
314: *   The Pydantic models (`LLMSettings`, `SandboxSettings`, `AppConfig`) define the expected structure and types for the settings read from `config.toml`.
315: *   The `Config` class uses `__new__` and `_lock` to implement the singleton pattern, ensuring only one instance.
316: *   `__init__` calls `_load_initial_config` only once.
317: *   `_load_initial_config` reads the TOML file and uses the Pydantic models (within `AppConfig`) to parse and validate the settings, storing the result in `self._config`.
318: *   `@property` decorators provide clean access (e.g., `config.llm`) to the stored settings.
319: *   `config = Config()` at the end creates the actual singleton instance that gets imported elsewhere.
320: 
321: ## Wrapping Up Chapter 7
322: 
323: We've learned that the `Config` system is OpenManus's way of managing application settings. It reads configurations from the `config.toml` file at startup, validates them using Pydantic [Schemas](06_schema.md), and makes them available throughout the application via a single, shared `config` object (using the singleton pattern). This keeps settings separate from code, making the application more flexible, secure, and easier to manage.
324: 
325: Many components rely on these configurations. For instance, when an agent needs to execute code safely, it might use a `DockerSandbox`. The settings for this sandbox – like which Docker image to use or how much memory to allow – are read directly from the configuration we just discussed.
326: 
327: Let's move on to [Chapter 8: DockerSandbox](08_dockersandbox.md) to see how OpenManus provides a secure environment for running code generated by agents, using settings managed by our `Config` system.

  8: # Chapter 8: DockerSandbox - A Safe Play Area for Code
  9: 
 10: Welcome to Chapter 8! In [Chapter 7: Configuration (Config)](07_configuration__config_.md), we learned how OpenManus manages settings using the `config.toml` file and the `Config` object. We saw settings for the [LLM](01_llm.md), search tools, and something called `[sandbox]`. Now, let's dive into what that sandbox is!
 11: 
 12: ## What Problem Does `DockerSandbox` Solve?
 13: 
 14: Imagine our agent, powered by a smart [LLM](01_llm.md), needs to test a piece of code it just wrote, or run a shell command to check something on the system. For example, the user asks: "Write a Python script that calculates 2 plus 2 and run it."
 15: 
 16: The agent might generate the code `print(2 + 2)`. But where should it run this code?
 17: 
 18: Running code generated by an AI, especially one connected to the internet, directly on your own computer is **risky**! What if the AI accidentally (or if tricked) generates harmful code like `delete_all_my_files()`? That would be disastrous!
 19: 
 20: We need a safe, isolated place to run potentially untrusted commands or code – a place where even if something goes wrong, it doesn't affect our main system.
 21: 
 22: **This is exactly what the `DockerSandbox` provides.** Think of it as a **secure laboratory sandbox** or a disposable, locked room. Inside this room, the agent can perform potentially messy or dangerous experiments (like running code) without any risk to the outside environment (your computer).
 23: 
 24: **Use Case:** Our agent needs to execute the Python code `print(2 + 2)`. Instead of running it directly, it will ask the `DockerSandbox` to run it inside a secure container. The sandbox will execute the code, capture the output ("4"), and report it back, all without giving the code access to the host machine's files or settings.
 25: 
 26: ## Key Concepts: Secure Execution with Docker
 27: 
 28: 1.  **Isolation via Docker:** `DockerSandbox` uses **Docker containers** to achieve isolation. Docker is a technology that allows packaging applications and their dependencies into lightweight, self-contained units called containers. Crucially, these containers run isolated from the host system and each other. They have their own restricted view of files, network, and processes. It's like giving the code its own mini-computer to run on, completely separate from yours.
 29: 2.  **The Sandbox Container:** When needed, the `DockerSandbox` system creates a specific Docker container based on settings in your `config.toml`. This container is the actual "sandbox" environment.
 30: 3.  **Lifecycle Management:** The `DockerSandbox` system handles the entire life of the container:
 31:     *   **Creation:** Starting up a fresh container when needed.
 32:     *   **Command Execution:** Running commands (like `python script.py` or `ls`) inside the container.
 33:     *   **File Transfers:** Safely copying files into or out of the container if needed (e.g., putting a script file in, getting a result file out).
 34:     *   **Cleanup:** Stopping and removing the container automatically when it's no longer needed or after a period of inactivity, ensuring no resources are wasted.
 35: 4.  **Configuration (`config.toml`):** As we saw in the [previous chapter](07_configuration__config_.md), the `[sandbox]` section in `config.toml` controls how the sandbox behaves:
 36:     *   `use_sandbox = true`: Turns the sandbox feature on. If `false`, code might run directly on the host (less safe!).
 37:     *   `image = "python:3.12-slim"`: Specifies which Docker base image to use (e.g., a minimal Python environment).
 38:     *   `memory_limit = "512m"`: Restricts how much memory the container can use.
 39:     *   `cpu_limit = 1.0`: Restricts how much CPU power the container can use.
 40:     *   `timeout = 300`: Sets a default time limit (in seconds) for commands.
 41:     *   `network_enabled = false`: Controls whether the container can access the internet (often disabled for extra security).
 42: 
 43: ## How Do We Use It? (Via Tools and Clients)
 44: 
 45: Typically, you don't interact with the `DockerSandbox` class directly. Instead, [Tools](04_tool___toolcollection.md) that need to execute code, like `Bash` (`app/tool/bash.py`) or `PythonExecute` (`app/tool/python_execute.py`), often use a helper called a **Sandbox Client** to interact with the sandbox environment *if* it's enabled in the configuration.
 46: 
 47: OpenManus provides a ready-to-use client instance: `SANDBOX_CLIENT` (from `app/sandbox/client.py`).
 48: 
 49: Let's see conceptually how a tool might use `SANDBOX_CLIENT` to run our `print(2 + 2)` example safely.
 50: 
 51: **1. Check Configuration:**
 52: First, the system checks if the sandbox is enabled.
 53: 
 54: ```python
 55: # Check the configuration loaded in Chapter 7
 56: from app.config import config
 57: 
 58: if config.sandbox and config.sandbox.use_sandbox:
 59:     print("Sandbox is ENABLED. Code will run inside a container.")
 60:     # Proceed with using the sandbox client...
 61: else:
 62:     print("Sandbox is DISABLED. Code might run directly on the host (potentially unsafe).")
 63:     # Fallback or raise an error...
 64: ```
 65: 
 66: **Explanation:**
 67: *   We import the global `config` object.
 68: *   We check `config.sandbox` (to see if the section exists) and `config.sandbox.use_sandbox`. This value comes directly from your `config.toml` file.
 69: 
 70: **2. Use the Sandbox Client:**
 71: If the sandbox is enabled, a tool would use the shared `SANDBOX_CLIENT` to execute the command.
 72: 
 73: ```python
 74: # Example of using the sandbox client (simplified)
 75: from app.sandbox.client import SANDBOX_CLIENT
 76: import asyncio
 77: 
 78: # Assume sandbox is enabled based on the config check above
 79: 
 80: # The Python code our agent wants to run
 81: python_code = "print(2 + 2)"
 82: 
 83: # Create a temporary script file content
 84: # We wrap the code to make it executable via 'python script.py'
 85: script_content = f"{python_code}"
 86: script_name = "temp_script.py"
 87: 
 88: # Define the command to run inside the sandbox
 89: command_to_run = f"python {script_name}"
 90: 
 91: async def run_in_sandbox():
 92:     try:
 93:         print(f"Asking sandbox to run: {command_to_run}")
 94: 
 95:         # 1. Create the sandbox container (if not already running)
 96:         # The client handles this automatically based on config
 97:         # (Simplified: Actual creation might be handled by a manager)
 98:         # await SANDBOX_CLIENT.create(config=config.sandbox) # Often implicit
 99: 
100:         # 2. Write the script file into the sandbox
101:         await SANDBOX_CLIENT.write_file(script_name, script_content)
102:         print(f"Wrote '{script_name}' to sandbox.")
103: 
104:         # 3. Execute the command inside the sandbox
105:         output = await SANDBOX_CLIENT.run_command(command_to_run)
106:         print(f"Sandbox execution output: {output}")
107: 
108:     except Exception as e:
109:         print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
110:     # finally:
111:         # 4. Cleanup (often handled automatically by a manager or context)
112:         # await SANDBOX_CLIENT.cleanup()
113:         # print("Sandbox cleaned up.")
114: 
115: # Run the async function
116: # asyncio.run(run_in_sandbox()) # Uncomment to run
117: ```
118: 
119: **Explanation:**
120: 
121: 1.  We import the pre-configured `SANDBOX_CLIENT`.
122: 2.  We define the Python code and the command (`python temp_script.py`) needed to execute it.
123: 3.  `SANDBOX_CLIENT.write_file(script_name, script_content)`: This copies our Python code into a file *inside* the isolated container. The path `script_name` refers to a path *within* the sandbox.
124: 4.  `SANDBOX_CLIENT.run_command(command_to_run)`: This is the core step! It tells the Docker container to execute `python temp_script.py`. The client waits for the command to finish and captures its output (stdout).
125: 5.  The `output` variable receives the result ("4\n" in this case).
126: 6.  **Crucially**, the actual container creation and cleanup might be managed automatically in the background (by the `SandboxManager`, see `app/sandbox/core/manager.py`) or handled when the client is used within a specific context, so explicit `create()` and `cleanup()` calls might not always be needed directly in the tool's code.
127: 
128: **Expected Output (High Level):**
129: 
130: ```
131: Sandbox is ENABLED. Code will run inside a container.
132: Asking sandbox to run: python temp_script.py
133: Wrote 'temp_script.py' to sandbox.
134: Sandbox execution output: 4
135: 
136: # (Cleanup messages might appear depending on implementation)
137: ```
138: 
139: The important part is that `print(2 + 2)` was executed securely *inside* the Docker container, managed by the sandbox system, without exposing the host machine.
140: 
141: ## Under the Hood: How Sandbox Execution Works
142: 
143: Let's trace the simplified journey when a tool uses `SANDBOX_CLIENT.run_command("python script.py")`:
144: 
145: 1.  **Request:** The tool (e.g., `PythonExecute`) calls `SANDBOX_CLIENT.run_command(...)`.
146: 2.  **Check/Create Container:** The `SANDBOX_CLIENT` (likely using `DockerSandbox` internally, possibly managed by `SandboxManager`) checks if a suitable sandbox container is already running. If not, it creates one based on the `SandboxSettings` from the `config` object (pulling the image, setting resource limits, etc.). This uses the Docker engine installed on your host machine.
147: 3.  **Execute Command:** The client sends the command (`python script.py`) to the running Docker container for execution.
148: 4.  **Docker Runs Command:** The Docker engine runs the command *inside* the isolated container environment. The script executes.
149: 5.  **Capture Output:** The `DockerSandbox` infrastructure captures the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) produced by the command within the container.
150: 6.  **Return Result:** The captured output is sent back to the `SANDBOX_CLIENT`.
151: 7.  **Client Returns:** The `SANDBOX_CLIENT` returns the output string to the calling tool.
152: 8.  **(Later) Cleanup:** The `SandboxManager` or context eventually decides to stop and remove the idle container to free up resources.

189: 
190: ## Code Glimpse: Sandbox Components
191: 
192: Let's look at simplified snippets of the key parts.
193: 
194: **1. `SandboxSettings` in `app/config.py`:**
195: This Pydantic model defines the structure for the `[sandbox]` section in `config.toml`.
196: 
197: ```python
198: # Simplified snippet from app/config.py
199: from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
200: 
201: class SandboxSettings(BaseModel):
202:     """Configuration for the execution sandbox"""
203:     use_sandbox: bool = Field(False, description="Whether to use the sandbox")
204:     image: str = Field("python:3.12-slim", description="Base image")
205:     work_dir: str = Field("/workspace", description="Container working directory")
206:     memory_limit: str = Field("512m", description="Memory limit")
207:     cpu_limit: float = Field(1.0, description="CPU limit")
208:     timeout: int = Field(300, description="Default command timeout (seconds)")
209:     network_enabled: bool = Field(False, description="Whether network access is allowed")
210: ```
211: 
212: **Explanation:** This defines the expected settings and their types, which `Config` uses to validate `config.toml`.
213: 
214: **2. `LocalSandboxClient` in `app/sandbox/client.py`:**
215: This class provides a convenient interface to the underlying `DockerSandbox`.
216: 
217: ```python
218: # Simplified snippet from app/sandbox/client.py
219: from app.config import SandboxSettings
220: from app.sandbox.core.sandbox import DockerSandbox
221: from typing import Optional
222: 
223: class LocalSandboxClient: # Implements BaseSandboxClient
224:     def __init__(self):
225:         self.sandbox: Optional[DockerSandbox] = None
226: 
227:     async def create(self, config: Optional[SandboxSettings] = None, ...):
228:         """Creates a sandbox if one doesn't exist."""
229:         if not self.sandbox:
230:             # Create the actual DockerSandbox instance
231:             self.sandbox = DockerSandbox(config, ...)
232:             await self.sandbox.create() # Start the container
233: 
234:     async def run_command(self, command: str, timeout: Optional[int] = None) -> str:
235:         """Runs command in the sandbox."""
236:         if not self.sandbox:
237:             # Simplified: In reality, might auto-create or raise error
238:             await self.create() # Ensure sandbox exists
239: 
240:         # Delegate the command execution to the DockerSandbox instance
241:         return await self.sandbox.run_command(command, timeout)
242: 
243:     async def write_file(self, path: str, content: str) -> None:
244:         """Writes file to the sandbox."""
245:         if not self.sandbox: await self.create()
246:         # Delegate writing to the DockerSandbox instance
247:         await self.sandbox.write_file(path, content)
248: 
249:     async def cleanup(self) -> None:
250:         """Cleans up the sandbox resources."""
251:         if self.sandbox:
252:             await self.sandbox.cleanup() # Tell DockerSandbox to stop/remove container
253:             self.sandbox = None
254: 
255: # Create the shared instance used by tools
256: SANDBOX_CLIENT = LocalSandboxClient()
257: ```
258: 
259: **Explanation:** The client acts as a middleman. It holds a `DockerSandbox` instance and forwards calls like `run_command` or `write_file` to it, potentially handling creation/cleanup implicitly.
260: 
261: **3. `DockerSandbox` in `app/sandbox/core/sandbox.py`:**
262: This class interacts directly with the Docker engine.
263: 
264: ```python
265: # Simplified snippet from app/sandbox/core/sandbox.py
266: import docker
267: import asyncio
268: from app.config import SandboxSettings
269: from app.sandbox.core.terminal import AsyncDockerizedTerminal # For running commands

271: class DockerSandbox:
272:     def __init__(self, config: Optional[SandboxSettings] = None, ...):
273:         self.config = config or SandboxSettings()
274:         self.client = docker.from_env() # Connect to Docker engine
275:         self.container: Optional[docker.models.containers.Container] = None
276:         self.terminal: Optional[AsyncDockerizedTerminal] = None
277: 
278:     async def create(self) -> "DockerSandbox":
279:         """Creates and starts the Docker container."""
280:         try:
281:             # 1. Prepare container settings (image, limits, etc.) from self.config
282:             container_config = {...} # Simplified
283: 
284:             # 2. Use Docker client to create the container
285:             container_data = await asyncio.to_thread(
286:                 self.client.api.create_container, **container_config
287:             )
288:             self.container = self.client.containers.get(container_data["Id"])
289: 
290:             # 3. Start the container
291:             await asyncio.to_thread(self.container.start)
292: 
293:             # 4. Initialize a terminal interface to run commands inside
294:             self.terminal = AsyncDockerizedTerminal(container_data["Id"], ...)
295:             await self.terminal.init()
296:             return self
297:         except Exception as e:
298:             await self.cleanup() # Cleanup on failure
299:             raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to create sandbox: {e}")
300: 
301:     async def run_command(self, cmd: str, timeout: Optional[int] = None) -> str:
302:         """Runs a command using the container's terminal."""
303:         if not self.terminal: raise RuntimeError("Sandbox not initialized")
304:         # Use the terminal helper to execute the command and get output
305:         return await self.terminal.run_command(
306:             cmd, timeout=timeout or self.config.timeout
307:         )
308: 
309:     async def write_file(self, path: str, content: str) -> None:
310:         """Writes content to a file inside the container."""
311:         if not self.container: raise RuntimeError("Sandbox not initialized")
312:         try:
313:             # Simplified: Creates a temporary tar archive with the file
314:             # and uses Docker's put_archive to copy it into the container
315:             tar_stream = await self._create_tar_stream(...) # Helper method
316:             await asyncio.to_thread(
317:                 self.container.put_archive, "/", tar_stream
318:             )
319:         except Exception as e:
320:             raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to write file: {e}")
321: 
322:     async def cleanup(self) -> None:
323:         """Stops and removes the Docker container."""
324:         if self.terminal: await self.terminal.close()
325:         if self.container:
326:             try:
327:                 await asyncio.to_thread(self.container.stop, timeout=5)
328:             except Exception: pass # Ignore errors on stop
329:             try:
330:                 await asyncio.to_thread(self.container.remove, force=True)
331:             except Exception: pass # Ignore errors on remove
332:             self.container = None
333: ```
334: 
335: **Explanation:** This class contains the low-level logic to interact with Docker's API (via the `docker` Python library) to create, start, stop, and remove containers, as well as execute commands and transfer files using Docker's mechanisms.
336: 
337: ## Wrapping Up Chapter 8
338: 
339: You've learned about the `DockerSandbox`, a critical security feature in OpenManus. It provides an isolated Docker container environment where agents can safely execute potentially untrusted code or commands generated by the [LLM](01_llm.md), using tools like `Bash` or `PythonExecute`. By isolating execution, the sandbox protects your host system from accidental or malicious harm. Its behavior is configured in `config.toml`, and it's typically used via the `SANDBOX_CLIENT` interface.
340: 
341: Now that we understand the core components – LLMs, Memory, Agents, Tools, Flows, Schemas, Config, and the Sandbox – how does information, especially structured data and context, flow between the user, the agent, and external models or tools in a standardized way?
342: 
343: Let's move on to the final core concept in [Chapter 9: MCP (Model Context Protocol)](09_mcp__model_context_protocol_.md) to explore how OpenManus defines a protocol for rich context exchange.

  8: # Chapter 9: MCP (Model Context Protocol)
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the final chapter of our core concepts tutorial! In [Chapter 8: DockerSandbox](08_dockersandbox.md), we saw how OpenManus can safely run code in an isolated environment. Now, let's explore a powerful way to extend your agent's capabilities *without* changing its internal code: the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.
 11: 
 12: ## What Problem Does MCP Solve?
 13: 
 14: Imagine you have an agent running smoothly. Suddenly, you realize you need it to perform a new, specialized task – maybe interacting with a custom company database or using a complex scientific calculation library.
 15: 
 16: Normally, you might have to:
 17: 1.  Stop the agent.
 18: 2.  Write new code for the [Tool](04_tool___toolcollection.md) that performs this task.
 19: 3.  Add this tool to the agent's code or configuration.
 20: 4.  Restart the agent.
 21: 
 22: This process can be cumbersome, especially if you want to add or update tools frequently, or if different people are managing different tools.
 23: 
 24: What if there was a way for the agent to **dynamically discover and use tools** provided by a completely separate service? Like plugging in a new USB device, and your computer automatically recognizes and uses it?
 25: 
 26: **This is what MCP enables!** It defines a standard way for an OpenManus agent (`MCPAgent`) to connect to an external **MCP Server**. This server advertises the tools it offers, and the agent can call these tools remotely as if they were built-in.
 27: 
 28: **Use Case:** Let's say we want our agent to be able to run basic shell commands (like `ls` or `pwd`) using the `Bash` tool. Instead of building the `Bash` tool directly into the agent, we can run an `MCPServer` that *offers* the `Bash` tool. Our `MCPAgent` can connect to this server, discover the `Bash` tool, and use it when needed, all without having the `Bash` tool's code inside the agent itself. If we later update the `Bash` tool on the server, the agent automatically gets the new version without needing changes.
 29: 
 30: ## Key Concepts: The Agent, The Server, and The Rules
 31: 
 32: MCP involves a few key players working together:
 33: 
 34: 1.  **`MCPServer` (The Tool Provider):**
 35:     *   Think of this as a separate application, like a dedicated "Tool Shop" running independently from your agent.
 36:     *   It holds one or more [Tools](04_tool___toolcollection.md) (like `Bash`, `BrowserUseTool`, `StrReplaceEditor`, or custom ones).
 37:     *   It "advertises" these tools, meaning it can tell connected clients (agents) which tools are available, what they do, and how to use them.
 38:     *   When asked, it executes a tool and sends the result back.
 39:     *   In OpenManus, `app/mcp/server.py` provides an implementation of this server.
 40: 
 41: 2.  **`MCPAgent` (The Tool User):**
 42:     *   This is a specialized type of [BaseAgent](03_baseagent.md) designed specifically to talk to an `MCPServer`.
 43:     *   When it starts, it connects to the specified `MCPServer`.
 44:     *   It asks the server: "What tools do you have?"
 45:     *   It treats the server's tools as its own available `ToolCollection`.
 46:     *   When its [LLM](01_llm.md) decides to use one of these tools, the `MCPAgent` sends a request to the `MCPServer` to execute it.
 47:     *   It can even periodically check if the server has added or removed tools and update its capabilities accordingly!
 48: 
 49: 3.  **The Protocol (The Rules of Communication):**
 50:     *   MCP defines the exact format of messages exchanged between the `MCPAgent` and `MCPServer`. How does the agent ask for the tool list? How does it request a tool execution? How is the result formatted?
 51:     *   OpenManus supports two main ways (transports) for this communication:
 52:         *   **stdio (Standard Input/Output):** The agent starts the server process directly and communicates with it using standard text streams (like typing commands in a terminal). This is simpler for local setups.
 53:         *   **SSE (Server-Sent Events):** The agent connects to a running server over the network (using HTTP). This is more suitable if the server is running elsewhere.
 54: 
 55: *Analogy:* Imagine the `MCPServer` is a smart TV's App Store, offering apps (tools) like Netflix or YouTube. The `MCPAgent` is a universal remote control. MCP is the protocol that lets the remote connect to the TV, see the available apps, and tell the TV "Launch Netflix" or "Play this video on YouTube". The actual app logic runs on the TV (the server), not the remote (the agent).
 56: 
 57: ## How Do We Use It?
 58: 
 59: Let's see how to run the server and connect an agent using the simple `stdio` method.
 60: 
 61: **1. Run the MCPServer:**
 62: 
 63: The server needs to be running first. OpenManus provides a script to run a server that includes standard tools like `Bash`, `Browser`, and `Editor`.
 64: 
 65: Open a terminal and run:
 66: 
 67: ```bash
 68: # Make sure you are in the root directory of the OpenManus project
 69: # Use python to run the server module
 70: python -m app.mcp.server --transport stdio
 71: ```
 72: 
 73: **Expected Output (in the server terminal):**
 74: 
 75: ```
 76: INFO:root:Registered tool: bash
 77: INFO:root:Registered tool: browser
 78: INFO:root:Registered tool: editor
 79: INFO:root:Registered tool: terminate
 80: INFO:root:Starting OpenManus server (stdio mode)
 81: # --- The server is now running and waiting for a connection ---
 82: ```
 83: 
 84: **Explanation:**
 85: *   `python -m app.mcp.server` tells Python to run the server code located in `app/mcp/server.py`.
 86: *   `--transport stdio` specifies that it should listen for connections via standard input/output.
 87: *   It registers the built-in tools and waits.
 88: 
 89: **2. Run the MCPAgent (connecting to the server):**
 90: 
 91: Now, open a *separate* terminal. We'll run a script that starts the `MCPAgent` and tells it how to connect to the server we just started.
 92: 
 93: ```bash
 94: # In a NEW terminal, in the root directory of OpenManus
 95: # Run the MCP agent runner script
 96: python run_mcp.py --connection stdio --interactive
 97: ```
 98: 
 99: **Expected Output (in the agent terminal):**
100: 
101: ```
102: INFO:app.config:Configuration loaded successfully from .../config/config.toml
103: INFO:app.agent.mcp:Initializing MCPAgent with stdio connection...
104: # ... (potential logs about connecting) ...
105: INFO:app.tool.mcp:Connected to server with tools: ['bash', 'browser', 'editor', 'terminate']
106: INFO:app.agent.mcp:Connected to MCP server via stdio
107: 
108: MCP Agent Interactive Mode (type 'exit' to quit)
109: 
110: Enter your request:
111: ```
112: 
113: **Explanation:**
114: *   `python run_mcp.py` runs the agent launcher script.
115: *   `--connection stdio` tells the agent to connect using standard input/output. The script (`run_mcp.py`) knows how to start the server process (`python -m app.mcp.server`) for this mode.
116: *   `--interactive` puts the agent in a mode where you can chat with it.
117: *   The agent connects, asks the server for its tools (`list_tools`), and logs the tools it found (`bash`, `browser`, etc.). It's now ready for your requests!
118: 
119: **3. Interact with the Agent (Using a Server Tool):**
120: 
121: Now, in the agent's interactive prompt, ask it to do something that requires a tool provided by the server, like listing files using `bash`:
122: 
123: ```text
124: # In the agent's terminal
125: Enter your request: Use the bash tool to list the files in the current directory.
126: ```
127: 
128: **What Happens:**
129: 
130: 1.  The `MCPAgent` receives your request.
131: 2.  Its [LLM](01_llm.md) analyzes the request and decides the `bash` tool is needed, with the command `ls`.
132: 3.  The agent sees that `bash` is a tool provided by the connected `MCPServer`.
133: 4.  The agent sends a `call_tool` request over `stdio` to the server: "Please run `bash` with `command='ls'`".
134: 5.  The `MCPServer` receives the request, finds its `Bash` tool, and executes `ls`.
135: 6.  The server captures the output (the list of files).
136: 7.  The server sends the result back to the agent.
137: 8.  The agent receives the result, adds it to its [Memory](02_message___memory.md), and might use its LLM again to formulate a user-friendly response based on the tool's output.
138: 
139: **Expected Output (in the agent terminal, may vary):**
140: 
141: ```text
142: # ... (Potential LLM thinking logs) ...
143: INFO:app.agent.mcp:Executing tool: bash with input {'command': 'ls'}
144: # ... (Server logs might show execution in its own terminal) ...
145: 
146: Agent: The bash tool executed the 'ls' command and returned the following output:
147: [List of files/directories in the project root, e.g.,]
148: README.md
149: app
150: config
151: run_mcp.py
152: ... etc ...
153: ```
154: 
155: Success! The agent used a tool (`bash`) that wasn't part of its own code, but was provided dynamically by the external `MCPServer` via the Model Context Protocol. If you added a *new* tool to the `MCPServer` code and restarted the server, the agent could potentially discover and use it without needing any changes itself (it periodically refreshes the tool list).
156: 
157: Type `exit` in the agent's terminal to stop it, then stop the server (usually Ctrl+C in its terminal).
158: 
159: ## Under the Hood: How MCP Communication Flows
160: 
161: Let's trace the simplified steps when the agent uses a server tool:
162: 
163: 1.  **Connect & List:** Agent starts, connects to Server (`stdio` or `SSE`). Agent sends `list_tools` request. Server replies with list of tools (`name`, `description`, `parameters`). Agent stores these.
164: 2.  **User Request:** User asks agent to do something (e.g., "list files").
165: 3.  **LLM Decides:** Agent's LLM decides to use `bash` tool with `command='ls'`.
166: 4.  **Agent Request:** Agent finds `bash` in its list of server tools. Sends `call_tool` request to Server (containing tool name `bash` and arguments `{'command': 'ls'}`).
167: 5.  **Server Executes:** Server receives request. Finds its internal `Bash` tool. Calls the tool's `execute(command='ls')` method. The tool runs `ls`.
168: 6.  **Server Response:** Server gets the result from the tool (e.g., "README.md\napp\n..."). Sends this result back to the Agent.
169: 7.  **Agent Processes:** Agent receives the result. Updates its memory. Presents the answer to the user.

195: 
196: ## Code Glimpse: Key MCP Components
197: 
198: Let's look at simplified parts of the relevant files.
199: 
200: **1. `MCPServer` (`app/mcp/server.py`): Registering Tools**
201: The server uses the `fastmcp` library to handle the protocol details. It needs to register the tools it wants to offer.
202: 
203: ```python
204: # Simplified snippet from app/mcp/server.py
205: from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
206: from app.tool.base import BaseTool
207: from app.tool.bash import Bash # Import the tool to offer
208: from app.logger import logger
209: import json
210: 
211: class MCPServer:
212:     def __init__(self, name: str = "openmanus"):
213:         self.server = FastMCP(name) # The underlying MCP server library
214:         self.tools: Dict[str, BaseTool] = {}
215:         # Add tools to offer
216:         self.tools["bash"] = Bash()
217:         # ... add other tools like Browser, Editor ...
218: 
219:     def register_tool(self, tool: BaseTool) -> None:
220:         """Registers a tool's execute method with the FastMCP server."""
221:         tool_name = tool.name
222:         tool_param = tool.to_param() # Get schema for the LLM
223:         tool_function = tool_param["function"]
224: 
225:         # Define the function that the MCP server will expose
226:         async def tool_method(**kwargs):
227:             logger.info(f"Executing {tool_name} via MCP: {kwargs}")
228:             # Call the actual tool's execute method
229:             result = await tool.execute(**kwargs)
230:             logger.info(f"Result of {tool_name}: {result}")
231:             # Return result (often needs conversion, e.g., to JSON)
232:             return json.dumps(result.model_dump()) if hasattr(result, "model_dump") else str(result)
233: 
234:         # Attach metadata (name, description, parameters) for discovery
235:         tool_method.__name__ = tool_name
236:         tool_method.__doc__ = self._build_docstring(tool_function)
237:         tool_method.__signature__ = self._build_signature(tool_function)
238: 
239:         # Register with the FastMCP library instance
240:         self.server.tool()(tool_method)
241:         logger.info(f"Registered tool for MCP: {tool_name}")
242: 
243:     def register_all_tools(self):
244:         for tool in self.tools.values():
245:             self.register_tool(tool)
246: 
247:     def run(self, transport: str = "stdio"):
248:         self.register_all_tools()
249:         logger.info(f"Starting MCP server ({transport} mode)")
250:         self.server.run(transport=transport) # Start listening
251: 
252: # Command-line execution part:
253: # if __name__ == "__main__":
254: #    server = MCPServer()
255: #    server.run(transport="stdio") # Or based on args
256: ```
257: 
258: **Explanation:** The `MCPServer` creates instances of tools (`Bash`, etc.) and then uses `register_tool` to wrap each tool's `execute` method into a format the `fastmcp` library understands. This allows the server to advertise the tool (with its name, description, parameters) and call the correct function when the agent makes a `call_tool` request.
259: 
260: **2. `MCPClients` (`app/tool/mcp.py`): Client-Side Tool Representation**
261: The `MCPAgent` uses this class, which acts like a `ToolCollection`, but its tools are proxies that make calls to the remote server.
262: 
263: ```python
264: # Simplified snippet from app/tool/mcp.py
265: from mcp import ClientSession # MCP library for client-side communication
266: from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client # Specific transport handler
267: from mcp.types import TextContent
268: from app.tool.base import BaseTool, ToolResult
269: from app.tool.tool_collection import ToolCollection
270: from contextlib import AsyncExitStack
271: 
272: # Represents a single tool on the server, callable from the client
273: class MCPClientTool(BaseTool):
274:     session: Optional[ClientSession] = None # Holds the connection
275: 
276:     async def execute(self, **kwargs) -> ToolResult:
277:         """Execute by calling the remote tool via the MCP session."""
278:         if not self.session: return ToolResult(error="Not connected")
279:         try:
280:             # Make the actual remote call
281:             result = await self.session.call_tool(self.name, kwargs)
282:             # Extract text output from the response
283:             content = ", ".join(
284:                 item.text for item in result.content if isinstance(item, TextContent)
285:             )
286:             return ToolResult(output=content or "No output.")
287:         except Exception as e:
288:             return ToolResult(error=f"MCP tool error: {e}")
289: 
290: # The collection holding the proxy tools
291: class MCPClients(ToolCollection):
292:     session: Optional[ClientSession] = None
293:     exit_stack: AsyncExitStack = None # Manages connection resources
294: 
295:     async def connect_stdio(self, command: str, args: List[str]):
296:         """Connect using stdio."""
297:         if self.session: await self.disconnect()
298:         self.exit_stack = AsyncExitStack()
299: 
300:         # Set up stdio connection using MCP library helper
301:         server_params = {"command": command, "args": args} # Simplified
302:         streams = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(
303:             stdio_client(server_params)
304:         )
305:         # Establish the MCP session over the connection
306:         self.session = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(
307:             ClientSession(*streams)
308:         )
309:         await self._initialize_and_list_tools() # Get tool list from server
310: 
311:     async def _initialize_and_list_tools(self):
312:         """Fetch tools from server and create proxy objects."""
313:         await self.session.initialize()
314:         response = await self.session.list_tools() # Ask server for tools
315: 
316:         self.tool_map = {}
317:         for tool_info in response.tools:
318:             # Create an MCPClientTool instance for each server tool
319:             proxy_tool = MCPClientTool(
320:                 name=tool_info.name,
321:                 description=tool_info.description,
322:                 parameters=tool_info.inputSchema, # Use schema from server
323:                 session=self.session, # Pass the active session
324:             )
325:             self.tool_map[tool_info.name] = proxy_tool
326:         self.tools = tuple(self.tool_map.values())
327:         logger.info(f"MCP Client found tools: {list(self.tool_map.keys())}")
328: 
329:     async def disconnect(self):
330:         if self.session and self.exit_stack:
331:             await self.exit_stack.aclose() # Clean up connection
332:             # ... reset state ...
333: ```
334: 
335: **Explanation:** `MCPClients` handles the connection (`connect_stdio`). When connected, it calls `list_tools` on the server. For each tool reported by the server, it creates a local `MCPClientTool` proxy object. This proxy object looks like a normal `BaseTool` (with name, description, parameters), but its `execute` method doesn't run code locally – instead, it uses the active `ClientSession` to send a `call_tool` request back to the server.
336: 
337: **3. `MCPAgent` (`app/agent/mcp.py`): Using MCPClients**
338: The agent integrates the `MCPClients` collection.
339: 
340: ```python
341: # Simplified snippet from app/agent/mcp.py
342: from app.agent.toolcall import ToolCallAgent
343: from app.tool.mcp import MCPClients
344: 
345: class MCPAgent(ToolCallAgent):
346:     # Use MCPClients as the tool collection
347:     mcp_clients: MCPClients = Field(default_factory=MCPClients)
348:     available_tools: MCPClients = None # Will point to mcp_clients
349: 
350:     connection_type: str = "stdio"
351:     # ... other fields ...
352: 
353:     async def initialize(
354:         self, command: Optional[str] = None, args: Optional[List[str]] = None, ...
355:     ):
356:         """Initialize by connecting the MCPClients instance."""
357:         if self.connection_type == "stdio":
358:             # Tell mcp_clients to connect
359:             await self.mcp_clients.connect_stdio(command=command, args=args or [])
360:         # elif self.connection_type == "sse": ...
361: 
362:         # The agent's tools are now the tools provided by the server
363:         self.available_tools = self.mcp_clients
364: 
365:         # Store initial tool schemas for detecting changes later
366:         self.tool_schemas = {t.name: t.parameters for t in self.available_tools}
367: 
368:         # Add system message about tools...
369: 
370:     async def _refresh_tools(self):
371:         """Periodically check the server for tool updates."""
372:         if not self.mcp_clients.session: return
373: 
374:         # Ask the server for its current list of tools
375:         response = await self.mcp_clients.session.list_tools()
376:         current_tools = {t.name: t.inputSchema for t in response.tools}
377: 
378:         # Compare with stored schemas (self.tool_schemas)
379:         # Detect added/removed tools and update self.tool_schemas
380:         # Add system messages to memory if tools change
381:         # ... logic to detect and log changes ...
382: 
383:     async def think(self) -> bool:
384:         """Agent's thinking step."""
385:         # Refresh tools periodically
386:         if self.current_step % self._refresh_tools_interval == 0:
387:             await self._refresh_tools()
388:             # Stop if server seems gone (no tools left)
389:             if not self.mcp_clients.tool_map: return False
390: 
391:         # Use parent class's think method, which uses self.available_tools
392:         # (which points to self.mcp_clients) for tool decisions/calls
393:         return await super().think()
394: 
395:     async def cleanup(self):
396:         """Disconnect the MCP session when the agent finishes."""
397:         if self.mcp_clients.session:
398:             await self.mcp_clients.disconnect()
399: ```
400: 
401: **Explanation:** The `MCPAgent` holds an instance of `MCPClients`. In `initialize`, it tells `MCPClients` to connect to the server. It sets its own `available_tools` to point to the `MCPClients` instance. When the agent's `think` method (inherited from `ToolCallAgent`) needs to consider or execute tools, it uses `self.available_tools`. Because this *is* the `MCPClients` object, any tool execution results in a remote call to the `MCPServer` via the proxy tools. The agent also adds logic to periodically `_refresh_tools` and `cleanup` the connection.

403: ## Wrapping Up Chapter 9
404: 
405: Congratulations on completing the core concepts tutorial!
406: 
407: In this final chapter, we explored the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. You learned how MCP allows an `MCPAgent` to connect to an external `MCPServer` and dynamically discover and use tools hosted by that server. This provides a powerful way to extend agent capabilities with specialized tools without modifying the agent's core code, enabling a flexible, plug-and-play architecture for agent skills.
408: 
409: You've journeyed through the essential building blocks of OpenManus:
410: *   The "brain" ([LLM](01_llm.md))
411: *   Conversation history ([Message / Memory](02_message___memory.md))
412: *   The agent structure ([BaseAgent](03_baseagent.md))
413: *   Agent skills ([Tool / ToolCollection](04_tool___toolcollection.md))
414: *   Multi-step task orchestration ([BaseFlow](05_baseflow.md))
415: *   Data structure definitions ([Schema](06_schema.md))
416: *   Settings management ([Configuration (Config)](07_configuration__config_.md))
417: *   Secure code execution ([DockerSandbox](08_dockersandbox.md))
418: *   And dynamic external tools ([MCP](09_mcp__model_context_protocol_.md))
419: 
420: Armed with this knowledge, you're now well-equipped to start exploring the OpenManus codebase, experimenting with different agents and tools, and building your own intelligent applications! Good luck!

12: OpenManus<sup>[View Repo](https://github.com/mannaandpoem/OpenManus/tree/f616c5d43d02d93ccc6e55f11666726d6645fdc2)</sup> is a framework for building autonomous *AI agents*.
13: Think of it like a digital assistant that can perform tasks. It uses a central **brain** (an `LLM` like GPT-4) to understand requests and decide what to do next.
14: Agents can use various **tools** (like searching the web or writing code) to interact with the world or perform specific actions. Some complex tasks might involve a **flow** that coordinates multiple agents.
15: It keeps track of the conversation using `Memory` and ensures secure code execution using a `DockerSandbox`.
16: The system is flexible, allowing new tools to be added, even dynamically through the `MCP` protocol.

  8: # Chapter 1: Shared State (`shared` dictionary)
  9: 
 10: Welcome to your first step into the world of PocketFlow! Building powerful AI applications often involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. But how do these steps communicate with each other? How does one part of your AI know what another part has done or figured out? That's where the **`shared` dictionary** comes into play.
 11: 
 12: Imagine you're building a simple AI assistant.
 13: 1.  First, it needs to get your question (e.g., "What's the weather like in London?").
 14: 2.  Then, it might need to search the web for "weather in London."
 15: 3.  Finally, it uses your original question and the search results to give you an answer.
 16: 
 17: For this to work, the "question understanding" step needs to pass the question to the "web searching" step. Then, both the original question and the search results need to be available to the "answering" step. The `shared` dictionary is the magic message board that lets all these steps share information.
 18: 
 19: ## What is the `shared` Dictionary?
 20: 
 21: At its heart, the `shared` dictionary is a standard Python dictionary (`dict`). Think of it like a **communal backpack** or a **shared whiteboard**.
 22: As your PocketFlow application (which we call a [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md)) runs, different components (which we call [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md)) can:
 23: *   **Put things into it** (write data).
 24: *   **Look at what's inside** (read data).
 25: *   **Update things** that are already there.
 26: 
 27: This `shared` dictionary becomes the primary way for different parts of your workflow to pass data, intermediate results, and context to each other. It's available throughout the entire lifecycle of a single execution of a [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md).
 28: 
 29: ## How to Use the `shared` Dictionary
 30: 
 31: Let's see how this works with a few simple examples.
 32: 
 33: **1. Initializing `shared` with Starting Data**
 34: 
 35: Before your [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) even starts, you usually prepare some initial data. This data is placed into the `shared` dictionary.
 36: 
 37: Consider this snippet from one of our example projects (`cookbook/pocketflow-node/main.py`):
 38: ```python
 39: # This is how we can start with some data
 40: text_to_summarize = """
 41: PocketFlow is a minimalist LLM framework...
 42: """
 43: shared = {"data": text_to_summarize}
 44: 
 45: # Later, this 'shared' dictionary is passed when running the flow:
 46: # flow.run(shared)
 47: ```
 48: In this code:
 49: *   We have some `text_to_summarize`.
 50: *   We create a Python dictionary named `shared`.
 51: *   We add an entry to this dictionary: the key is `"data"` and its value is our `text_to_summarize`.
 52: When the [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) starts, this `shared` dictionary will be its starting point.
 53: 
 54: Here's another example from `cookbook/pocketflow-a2a/main.py` where a question is put into `shared`:
 55: ```python
 56: # Default question or one from command line
 57: question = "Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics 2024?"
 58: 
 59: # Process the question
 60: shared = {"question": question}
 61: # agent_flow.run(shared)
 62: ```
 63: Here, the `shared` dictionary is initialized with the `question` under the key `"question"`.
 64: 
 65: **2. A [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) Reading from `shared`**
 66: 
 67: [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) are the workers in your [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md). They often need to read data from the `shared` dictionary to know what to do. This usually happens in a Node's `prep` method.
 68: 
 69: Let's look at the `Summarize` [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) from `cookbook/pocketflow-node/flow.py`:
 70: ```python
 71: # Inside the Summarize Node class
 72: # def prep(self, shared):
 73: #     """Read and preprocess data from shared store."""
 74: #     return shared["data"] # Accesses the 'data' we set earlier
 75: ```
 76: When this `Summarize` [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) is about to run, its `prep` method is called. PocketFlow automatically passes the current `shared` dictionary to this method.
 77: The line `shared["data"]` retrieves the value associated with the key `"data"` – which is the text we want to summarize.
 78: 
 79: Another example from `cookbook/pocketflow-a2a/nodes.py`, in the `DecideAction` [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md):
 80: ```python
 81: # Inside the DecideAction Node's prep method
 82: # def prep(self, shared):
 83: # Get the current context (default if none exists)
 84: context = shared.get("context", "No previous search")
 85: # Get the question from the shared store
 86: question = shared["question"]
 87: return question, context
 88: ```
 89: This `prep` method reads two items:
 90: *   `shared.get("context", "No previous search")`: This tries to get the value for the key `"context"`. If `"context"` isn't found (maybe it's the first time this runs), it defaults to `"No previous search"`. Using `.get()` is a safe way to read, as it prevents errors if a key might be missing.
 91: *   `shared["question"]`: This directly retrieves the value for the key `"question"`, assuming it will always be there.
 92: 
 93: **3. A [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) Writing Results Back to `shared`**
 94: 
 95: After a [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) does its work (e.g., summarizes text, gets search results), it often needs to save its findings back into the `shared` dictionary. This typically happens in a Node's `post` method.
 96: 
 97: Continuing with our `Summarize` [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) (`cookbook/pocketflow-node/flow.py`):
 98: ```python
 99: # Inside the Summarize Node class
100: # 'exec_res' below is the result from the Node's main task
101: # def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
102: #     """Store the summary in shared store."""
103: #     shared["summary"] = exec_res # Stores the result
104: ```
105: Here, `exec_res` holds the summary generated by the [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md). The line `shared["summary"] = exec_res` creates a new key `"summary"` in the `shared` dictionary (or updates it if it already exists) and stores the summary there. Now, subsequent [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) can access this summary!
106: 
107: Similarly, in `DecideAction`'s `post` method (`cookbook/pocketflow-a2a/nodes.py`):
108: ```python
109: # Inside DecideAction Node's post method
110: # def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
111: # 'exec_res' contains the decision made by an LLM
112: if exec_res["action"] == "search":
113:     shared["search_query"] = exec_res["search_query"]
114:     # ...
115: else:
116:     shared["context"] = exec_res["answer"]
117:     # ...
118: # ...
119: ```
120: Depending on the `action` decided, this `post` method writes either a `"search_query"` or an updated `"context"` (which is the answer) into the `shared` dictionary.
121: 
122: **4. Modifying Existing Data in `shared`**
123: 
124: Sometimes, a [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) needs to update or add to existing information in `shared`. For example, in a chat application, you maintain a history of messages.
125: 
126: From `cookbook/pocketflow-chat/main.py`, the `ChatNode`'s `prep` method does this:
127: ```python
128: # Inside ChatNode's prep method
129: # def prep(self, shared):
130: # Initialize messages if this is the first run
131: if "messages" not in shared:
132:     shared["messages"] = [] # Create an empty list if no history
133: 
134: # ... user_input is obtained ...
135: 
136: # Add user message to history
137: shared["messages"].append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
138: # ...
139: ```
140: Here:
141: 1.  It checks if `"messages"` (our chat history) exists in `shared`. If not, it initializes `shared["messages"]` as an empty list.
142: 2.  It then appends the new user message to this list. The `shared["messages"]` list grows with each turn of the conversation.
143: 
144: **5. Accessing Final Results from `shared`**
145: 
146: Once your [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) has completed all its steps, the `shared` dictionary will contain the final outputs and any important intermediate data you chose to store. You can then access these results from your main script.
147: 
148: Back to `cookbook/pocketflow-node/main.py`:
149: ```python
150: # After the flow.run(shared) call:
151: # The 'shared' dictionary now contains the summary
152: 
153: print("\nSummary:", shared["summary"])
154: ```
155: This line simply prints the value associated with the key `"summary"` from the `shared` dictionary, which was put there by the `Summarize` [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md).
156: 
157: ## Key Characteristics of `shared`
158: 
159: *   **It's a Python Dictionary:** This makes it incredibly flexible and easy to use. If you know how to use dictionaries in Python (e.g., `my_dict['key'] = value`, `value = my_dict['key']`, `my_dict.get('key', default_value)`), you already know how to interact with `shared`.
160: *   **Scoped to a Single Flow Execution:** Each time you run a [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) (e.g., by calling `flow.run(shared_input)`), it operates on its own instance of the `shared` dictionary. If you run the same [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) twice, even simultaneously for different requests, they will have completely separate `shared` dictionaries. They won't interfere with each other. Think of it like two people filling out their own copies of the same form.
161: *   **Persistent Throughout One Flow Execution:** The `shared` dictionary is created (or you provide an initial one) when a [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) starts. The *exact same* dictionary object is then passed from one [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) to the next. Any modifications made by one [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) are visible to all subsequent [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md).
162: 
163: ## What Happens Under the Hood? (A Simplified View)
164: 
165: You don't need to manage the passing of the `shared` dictionary yourself; PocketFlow handles it for you. Here's a simplified step-by-step:
166: 
167: 1.  **You start a Flow:** You call something like `my_flow.run(initial_shared_data)`. `initial_shared_data` is the dictionary you've prepared.
168: 2.  **PocketFlow takes over:** It takes your `initial_shared_data` and passes it to the first [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) in your [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md).
169: 3.  **Node executes:**
170:     *   The [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md)'s `prep` method is called with the `shared` dictionary. It can read from it.
171:     *   The [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md)'s `exec` method (the main workhorse) is called.
172:     *   The [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md)'s `post` method is called with the `shared` dictionary. It can write results back to it.
173: 4.  **Pass it on:** PocketFlow determines the next [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) to run and passes the *same, possibly modified*, `shared` dictionary to it.
174: 5.  **Repeat:** Steps 3 and 4 repeat until there are no more [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) to run in the [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md).
175: 6.  **Flow ends:** The `run` method finishes, and the `shared` dictionary you originally passed in now contains all the updates made by the [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md).
176: 
177: Here's a visual way to think about it:
178: 
179: ```mermaid
180: sequenceDiagram
181:     participant You
182:     participant PocketFlowEngine as PocketFlow Engine
183:     participant NodeA as First Node
184:     participant NodeB as Second Node
185:     participant SharedDict as Shared Dictionary
186: 
187:     You->>PocketFlowEngine: my_flow.run(initial_shared)
188:     PocketFlowEngine->>SharedDict: Initialize with initial_shared
189:     PocketFlowEngine->>NodeA: process(SharedDict)
190:     NodeA->>SharedDict: Reads input (e.g., shared['question'])
191:     NodeA->>SharedDict: Writes output (e.g., shared['data_from_A'] = ...)
192:     PocketFlowEngine->>NodeB: process(SharedDict)
193:     NodeB->>SharedDict: Reads input (e.g., shared['data_from_A'])
194:     NodeB->>SharedDict: Writes output (e.g., shared['final_answer'] = ...)
195:     PocketFlowEngine->>You: Flow complete (initial_shared is now updated)
196: ```
197: 
198: ## Analogy Time!
199: 
200: Think of the `shared` dictionary as:
201: 
202: *   **A Relay Race Baton (but smarter!):** Each runner ([Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md)) takes the baton (`shared` dictionary), maybe adds a small note or a sticker to it, and then passes it to the next runner. By the end of the race, the baton has collected contributions from everyone.
203: *   **A Project's Shared Folder:** Imagine a team working on a project. They have a shared folder (`shared` dictionary) on a server. The first person creates a document (initial data). The next person opens it, adds their part, and saves it. The next person does the same. Everyone works on the same set of files in that folder.
204: 
205: ## Conclusion
206: 
207: You've now learned about the `shared` dictionary, the backbone of communication within a PocketFlow [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md). It's a simple yet powerful Python dictionary that allows different [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) to share data and context seamlessly. By reading from and writing to `shared`, your [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) can collaborate to achieve complex tasks.
208: 
209: Now that you understand how data is passed around, you're probably wondering about the "workers" themselves – the [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md). What are they, and how do you build them? Let's dive into that in the next chapter!
210:

  8: # Chapter 2: Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: Shared State (`shared` dictionary)](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md), we learned how different parts of a PocketFlow workflow can communicate using the `shared` dictionary. Now, let's meet the actual "workers" that perform the tasks and use this shared information: **Nodes**.
 11: 
 12: ## What are Nodes and Why Do We Need Them?
 13: 
 14: Imagine you're building an AI that helps you write a story. This process might involve several steps:
 15: 1.  Generate a story idea.
 16: 2.  Write an outline based on the idea.
 17: 3.  Write the first draft of a chapter using the outline.
 18: 4.  Review and edit the chapter.
 19: 
 20: Each of these steps is a distinct task. In PocketFlow, each such task would be handled by a **Node**.
 21: 
 22: A **Node** is the fundamental building block in PocketFlow. It represents a single, atomic step in your workflow. Think of it as a highly specialized worker on an assembly line, responsible for one specific job. This job could be:
 23: *   Calling a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate text.
 24: *   Searching the web for information.
 25: *   Making a decision based on some data.
 26: *   Reading user input.
 27: *   Saving results to a file.
 28: 
 29: By breaking down a complex process into a series of Nodes, we make our AI applications:
 30: *   **Modular:** Each Node focuses on one thing, making it easier to develop, test, and understand.
 31: *   **Reusable:** A Node designed for web search can be used in many different AI applications.
 32: *   **Manageable:** It's easier to build and debug a sequence of simple steps than one giant, monolithic piece of code.
 33: 
 34: ## The Anatomy of a Node: `prep`, `exec`, and `post`
 35: 
 36: Most Nodes in PocketFlow have a similar structure, typically involving three key methods:
 37: 
 38: 1.  **`prep(self, shared)` (Prepare):**
 39:     *   **Purpose:** This method is called *before* the Node does its main work. Its job is to get any necessary input data from the [shared dictionary](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md).
 40:     *   **Analogy:** An assembly line worker picking up the necessary parts from a shared bin before starting their task.
 41:     *   **Input:** It receives the `shared` dictionary.
 42:     *   **Output:** It usually returns the specific data the Node needs for its core logic.
 43: 
 44: 2.  **`exec(self, prep_res)` (Execute):**
 45:     *   **Purpose:** This is where the Node performs its core task. This is the "brain" or "muscle" of the Node.
 46:     *   **Analogy:** The assembly line worker actually assembling the parts or performing their specialized action.
 47:     *   **Input:** It receives the result from the `prep` method (`prep_res`).
 48:     *   **Output:** It returns the result of its execution (e.g., a summary, search results, a decision).
 49: 
 50: 3.  **`post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res)` (Post-process):**
 51:     *   **Purpose:** This method is called *after* the Node has finished its main work. Its jobs are:
 52:         *   To process the results from `exec`.
 53:         *   To update the [shared dictionary](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md) with these results or any other new information.
 54:         *   To decide what should happen next in the workflow (this is crucial for [Actions / Transitions](03_actions___transitions_.md), which we'll cover in the next chapter).
 55:     *   **Analogy:** The assembly line worker placing the finished component onto the conveyor belt (updating `shared`) and signaling if the item needs to go to a different station next (deciding the next action).
 56:     *   **Input:** It receives the `shared` dictionary, the result from `prep` (`prep_res`), and the result from `exec` (`exec_res`).
 57:     *   **Output:** It can return an "action" string that tells the [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md) which Node to execute next. If it returns nothing (or `None`), a default transition is usually followed.
 58: 
 59: Let's make this concrete with a simple example: a `SummarizeNode` whose job is to take some text and produce a short summary.
 60: 
 61: ```python
 62: # This is a conceptual Node, actual implementation details might vary slightly
 63: from pocketflow import Node # We'll import the base class
 64: 
 65: class SummarizeNode(Node):
 66:     def prep(self, shared):
 67:         # 1. Prepare: Get the text to summarize from 'shared'
 68:         print("SummarizeNode: Preparing...")
 69:         text_to_summarize = shared.get("document_text", "No text found.")
 70:         return text_to_summarize
 71: 
 72:     def exec(self, text_input):
 73:         # 2. Execute: Perform the summarization (e.g., call an LLM)
 74:         print(f"SummarizeNode: Executing with text: '{text_input[:30]}...'")
 75:         if not text_input or text_input == "No text found.":
 76:             return "Cannot summarize empty or missing text."
 77:         # In a real scenario, this would call an LLM or a summarization library
 78:         summary = f"This is a summary of: {text_input[:20]}..."
 79:         return summary
 80: 
 81:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 82:         # 3. Post-process: Store the summary in 'shared'
 83:         print(f"SummarizeNode: Posting summary: '{exec_res}'")
 84:         shared["summary_output"] = exec_res
 85:         # We might decide the next step here, e.g., return "summarization_done"
 86:         # For now, we'll just let it end by returning nothing (None)
 87: ```
 88: 
 89: Let's imagine how this `SummarizeNode` would work:
 90: 
 91: 1.  **Initialization:** You'd start with some text in the `shared` dictionary.
 92:     ```python
 93:     shared_data = {"document_text": "PocketFlow is a cool framework for building AI."}
 94:     ```
 95: 
 96: 2.  **Running the Node (simplified):**
 97:     *   **`prep(shared_data)` is called:** It looks into `shared_data` and finds `"PocketFlow is a cool framework for building AI."`. It returns this text.
 98:     *   **`exec("PocketFlow is a cool framework...")` is called:** It takes the text and (in our simplified example) creates a summary like `"This is a summary of: PocketFlow is a cool..."`. It returns this summary.
 99:     *   **`post(shared_data, text_from_prep, summary_from_exec)` is called:** It takes the `shared_data` and the `summary_from_exec`. It then adds a new entry: `shared_data["summary_output"] = "This is a summary of: PocketFlow is a cool..."`.
100: 
101: After the Node runs, `shared_data` would look like this:
102: ```
103: {
104:     "document_text": "PocketFlow is a cool framework for building AI.",
105:     "summary_output": "This is a summary of: PocketFlow is a cool..."
106: }
107: ```
108: The summary is now available in the `shared` dictionary for other Nodes or for final output!
109: 
110: ## Types of Nodes: `BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`
111: 
112: PocketFlow provides a few variations of Nodes, built on top of each other:
113: 
114: *   **`BaseNode`:**
115:     *   This is the most fundamental type of Node. It provides the basic structure with `prep`, `exec`, and `post` methods.
116:     *   It's like the basic blueprint for any worker.
117: 
118: *   **`Node` (inherits from `BaseNode`):**
119:     *   This is the standard synchronous Node you'll often use. "Synchronous" means it performs its task and waits for it to complete before anything else happens.
120:     *   It adds helpful features on top of `BaseNode`, like automatic **retries** if the `exec` method fails (e.g., a network error when calling an LLM) and an `exec_fallback` method that can be called if all retries fail.
121:     *   From `cookbook/pocketflow-node/flow.py`, our `Summarize` Node is an example of `Node`:
122:       ```python
123:       from pocketflow import Node
124:       # ... other imports ...
125: 
126:       class Summarize(Node): # Inherits from Node
127:           # ... prep, exec, post methods ...
128:           def exec_fallback(self, shared, prep_res, exc):
129:               """Provide a simple fallback instead of crashing."""
130:               return "There was an error processing your request."
131:       ```
132:       This `Summarize` Node, if its `exec` method fails (e.g., `call_llm` raises an error), will retry (default is 1 retry, but can be configured like `Summarize(max_retries=3)`). If all retries fail, `exec_fallback` is called.
133: 
134: *   **`AsyncNode` (inherits from `Node`):**
135:     *   This type of Node is for **asynchronous** tasks. Asynchronous tasks are those that might take some time to complete (like waiting for a web request or a user to type something) but don't need to block the entire program while they wait. They can "pause" and let other things run.
136:     *   `AsyncNode` uses `async` and `await` keywords from Python's `asyncio` library.
137:     *   It has asynchronous versions of the core methods: `prep_async`, `exec_async`, and `post_async`.
138:     *   We'll dive much deeper into asynchronous operations in [Chapter 5: Asynchronous Processing (`AsyncNode`, `AsyncFlow`)](05_asynchronous_processing___asyncnode____asyncflow___.md). For now, just know it exists for tasks that involve waiting.
139:     *   Example from `cookbook/pocketflow-async-basic/nodes.py`:
140:       ```python
141:       from pocketflow import AsyncNode
142:       # ... other imports ...
143: 
144:       class FetchRecipes(AsyncNode): # Inherits from AsyncNode
145:           async def prep_async(self, shared):
146:               # ... prepare input asynchronously ...
147:               ingredient = await get_user_input("Enter ingredient: ") # get_user_input is async
148:               return ingredient
149: 
150:           async def exec_async(self, ingredient):
151:               # ... execute task asynchronously ...
152:               recipes = await fetch_recipes(ingredient) # fetch_recipes is async
153:               return recipes
154: 
155:           async def post_async(self, shared, prep_res, recipes):
156:               # ... post-process asynchronously ...
157:               shared["recipes"] = recipes
158:               return "suggest" # Action for the next step
159:       ```
160:       Notice the `async def` and `await` keywords. This `FetchRecipes` Node can wait for user input and web requests without freezing the application.
161: 
162: ## How a Node Runs: Under the Hood (Simplified)
163: 
164: When PocketFlow decides it's time for a particular Node to run (as part of a [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md)), it essentially orchestrates the calling of its `prep`, `exec`, and `post` methods in sequence.
165: 
166: Here's a simplified view of what happens when a synchronous `Node`'s internal `_run` method is invoked:
167: 
168: 1.  **Call `prep`:** `prep_result = self.prep(shared)`
169:     *   Your Node's `prep` method is called with the current `shared` dictionary.
170:     *   Whatever `prep` returns is stored.
171: 
172: 2.  **Call `_exec` (which internally calls your `exec` with retries):** `exec_result = self._exec(prep_result)`
173:     *   The Node's `_exec` method is called with the `prep_result`.
174:     *   This `_exec` method in the `Node` class handles the retry logic. It will try to call your `exec(prep_result)` method.
175:     *   If your `exec` succeeds, its result is stored.
176:     *   If your `exec` raises an exception, `_exec` might wait and try again (up to `max_retries`).
177:     *   If all retries fail, `exec_fallback(prep_result, exception)` is called, and its result is used as `exec_result`.
178: 
179: 3.  **Call `post`:** `action = self.post(shared, prep_result, exec_result)`
180:     *   Your Node's `post` method is called with the `shared` dictionary, the `prep_result`, and the `exec_result`.
181:     *   `post` can modify `shared` and returns an action string (or `None`).
182: 
183: 4.  **Return Action:** The `action` returned by `post` is then used by the [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md) to determine the next Node to run.
184: 
185: Let's visualize this with a sequence diagram:
186: 
187: ```mermaid
188: sequenceDiagram
189:     participant FlowEngine as PocketFlow Engine
190:     participant YourNode as Your Node Instance
191:     participant SharedDict as Shared Dictionary
192: 
193:     FlowEngine->>YourNode: _run(SharedDict)
194:     YourNode->>YourNode: prep(SharedDict)
195:     Note right of YourNode: Reads from SharedDict
196:     YourNode-->>SharedDict: Access data (e.g., shared['input'])
197:     YourNode->>YourNode: _exec(prep_result)
198:     Note right of YourNode: Calls your exec(), handles retries/fallback
199:     YourNode->>YourNode: post(SharedDict, prep_result, exec_result)
200:     Note right of YourNode: Writes to SharedDict, decides next action
201:     YourNode-->>SharedDict: Update data (e.g., shared['output'] = ...)
202:     YourNode-->>FlowEngine: Returns action string
203: ```
204: 
205: **Code Glimpse (from `pocketflow/__init__.py`):**
206: 
207: The `BaseNode` class defines the fundamental execution flow in its `_run` method (this is a direct, slightly simplified version):
208: ```python
209: # Inside BaseNode class from pocketflow/__init__.py
210: def _run(self, shared):
211:     prep_output = self.prep(shared)
212:     exec_output = self._exec(prep_output) # _exec calls self.exec
213:     action = self.post(shared, prep_output, exec_output)
214:     return action
215: ```
216: This is the core loop for a single Node's execution.
217: 
218: The `Node` class (which inherits from `BaseNode`) overrides `_exec` to add retry and fallback logic:
219: ```python
220: # Simplified concept from Node class in pocketflow/__init__.py
221: def _exec(self, prep_res):
222:     for self.cur_retry in range(self.max_retries): # Loop for retries
223:         try:
224:             return self.exec(prep_res) # Call your Node's exec method
225:         except Exception as e:
226:             if self.cur_retry == self.max_retries - 1: # If last retry
227:                 return self.exec_fallback(prep_res, e) # Call fallback
228:             if self.wait > 0:
229:                 time.sleep(self.wait) # Wait before retrying
230: ```
231: This shows how `Node` makes your worker more robust by automatically handling temporary failures.
232: 
233: For `AsyncNode`, the methods are `prep_async`, `exec_async`, `post_async`, and they are `await`ed, allowing other tasks to run while waiting for I/O operations. This will be detailed in [Chapter 5](05_asynchronous_processing___asyncnode____asyncflow___.md).
234: 
235: ## Conclusion
236: 
237: You've now been introduced to **Nodes**, the workhorses of PocketFlow!
238: *   They represent **single, atomic steps** in your workflow.
239: *   They typically follow a **`prep` -> `exec` -> `post`** lifecycle.
240: *   `prep` gets data from the [shared dictionary](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md).
241: *   `exec` performs the core logic.
242: *   `post` updates the `shared` dictionary and can decide what happens next.
243: *   **`Node`** provides synchronous execution with retries and fallbacks.
244: *   **`AsyncNode`** provides asynchronous execution for I/O-bound tasks.
245: 
246: Nodes are the building blocks you'll use to define the individual capabilities of your AI agents and applications. But how do these Nodes connect to form a sequence or a more complex workflow? And how does the `post` method's return value actually control the flow? That's where [Actions / Transitions](03_actions___transitions__.md) come in, which we'll explore in the next chapter!

  8: # Chapter 3: Actions / Transitions
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 2: Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md), we learned that Nodes are the individual workers in our PocketFlow application, each performing a specific task. We also touched upon the `post` method of a Node, mentioning that it can return an "action" string. Now, it's time to explore exactly what these "actions" are and how they create "transitions," guiding the workflow dynamically.
 11: 
 12: Imagine you're building an AI research assistant. After the AI receives your question, it needs to decide: should it search the web for more information, or does it already have enough context to answer? This decision point, and acting upon it, is where Actions and Transitions shine.
 13: 
 14: ## What are Actions and Transitions?
 15: 
 16: **Actions** and **Transitions** are the mechanism by which a PocketFlow [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) determines the next [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) to execute.
 17: 
 18: *   An **Action** is usually a simple string (e.g., `"search"`, `"answer"`, `"proceed"`) returned by a [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md)'s `post` method after it completes its work. This string signals the outcome or a desired next step.
 19: *   A **Transition** is the rule defined within the [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) that says, "If *this* Node returns *this* action, then go to *that* Node next."
 20: 
 21: Think of it like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book. At the end of a section (a [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) finishing its task), you might be told, "If you want to open the door, turn to page 42. If you want to look under the bed, turn to page 55." The "open the door" part is the "action," and "turn to page 42" is the "transition."
 22: 
 23: This allows your workflow to be dynamic and intelligent, not just a fixed sequence of steps.
 24: 
 25: ## How to Use Actions and Transitions
 26: 
 27: Let's break down how you implement this, using our AI research assistant idea from `cookbook/pocketflow-a2a/`.
 28: 
 29: **1. A Node Returns an Action String**
 30: 
 31: The `post` method of a [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) is where the decision for the next action is typically made and returned.
 32: 
 33: Consider the `DecideAction` [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) from `cookbook/pocketflow-a2a/nodes.py`. Its job is to decide whether to search the web or try to answer the question directly.
 34: 
 35: ```python
 36: # Inside DecideAction Node class (cookbook/pocketflow-a2a/nodes.py)
 37: # ... (prep and exec methods are here) ...
 38: 
 39: class DecideAction(Node):
 40:     # ...
 41:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 42:         """Save the decision and determine the next step in the flow."""
 43:         # 'exec_res' is a dictionary like {"action": "search", "search_query": "..."}
 44:         # or {"action": "answer", "answer": "..."}
 45:         if exec_res["action"] == "search":
 46:             shared["search_query"] = exec_res["search_query"]
 47:             print(f"🔍 Agent decided to search for: {exec_res['search_query']}")
 48:         else:
 49:             # ... store answer if action is "answer" ...
 50:             print(f"💡 Agent decided to answer the question")
 51:         
 52:         # Return the action string to guide the Flow
 53:         return exec_res["action"] # This could be "search" or "answer"
 54: ```
 55: In this `post` method:
 56: *   It first updates the [shared dictionary](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md) based on the decision made in `exec_res`.
 57: *   Crucially, it returns `exec_res["action"]`. If the LLM in the `exec` method decided to search, this will be the string `"search"`. If it decided to answer, it will be `"answer"`. This returned string is the **action**.
 58: 
 59: **2. Defining Transitions in a Flow**
 60: 
 61: Now that our `DecideAction` [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) can return an action like `"search"` or `"answer"`, we need to tell the [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) what to do for each of these actions. This is done when you set up your [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md).
 62: 
 63: PocketFlow uses a very intuitive syntax: `current_node - "action_string" >> next_node`.
 64: 
 65: Let's look at `cookbook/pocketflow-a2a/flow.py`:
 66: ```python
 67: # From cookbook/pocketflow-a2a/flow.py
 68: from pocketflow import Flow
 69: from nodes import DecideAction, SearchWeb, AnswerQuestion
 70: 
 71: # Create instances of each node
 72: decide = DecideAction()
 73: search = SearchWeb()
 74: answer = AnswerQuestion()
 75: 
 76: # Connect the nodes using actions
 77: # If DecideAction returns "search", go to SearchWeb node
 78: decide - "search" >> search
 79: 
 80: # If DecideAction returns "answer", go to AnswerQuestion node
 81: decide - "answer" >> answer
 82: 
 83: # After SearchWeb completes and returns "decide", go back to DecideAction
 84: search - "decide" >> decide
 85: 
 86: # Create the flow, starting with the DecideAction node
 87: agent_flow = Flow(start=decide)
 88: ```
 89: Here's what's happening:
 90: *   `decide - "search" >> search`: This line says, "If the `decide` Node returns the action string `"search"`, then the *next* Node to execute should be the `search` Node."
 91: *   `decide - "answer" >> answer`: Similarly, "If `decide` returns `"answer"`, then go to the `answer` Node."
 92: *   `search - "decide" >> decide`: This creates a loop! After the `search` Node (which performs a web search) completes, its `post` method returns `"decide"`. This transition sends the control *back* to the `decide` Node, perhaps with new search results in the [shared dictionary](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md), to re-evaluate.
 93: 
 94: When `agent_flow.run(shared_data)` is called:
 95: 1.  The `decide` Node runs. Let's say its `post` method returns `"search"`.
 96: 2.  The `Flow` sees this action. It looks at the transitions defined for `decide`. It finds `decide - "search" >> search`.
 97: 3.  So, the `search` Node runs next.
 98: 4.  Let's say the `search` Node's `post` method returns `"decide"`.
 99: 5.  The `Flow` sees this. It finds `search - "decide" >> decide`.
100: 6.  The `decide` Node runs again. This time, with the search results in `shared`, it might return `"answer"`.
101: 7.  The `Flow` finds `decide - "answer" >> answer`.
102: 8.  The `answer` Node runs, generates the final answer, and its `post` method might return `"done"` (or `None`). If `"done"` isn't a defined transition for the `answer` Node, the flow might end.
103: 
104: **3. Default Transitions**
105: 
106: What if a Node's `post` method returns `None` (i.e., nothing), or it returns an action string for which you haven't defined a specific transition (e.g., `decide` returns `"unknown_action"`)?
107: 
108: Often, you'll define a **default transition**. This is like the "else" in an if-else statement. If no specific action matches, the default transition is taken.
109: 
110: The syntax for a default transition is simpler: `current_node >> next_node_for_default_action`.
111: 
112: Let's look at `cookbook/pocketflow-supervisor/flow.py`:
113: ```python
114: # From cookbook/pocketflow-supervisor/flow.py
115: # ... (agent_flow is an inner Flow, supervisor is a SupervisorNode) ...
116: 
117: # Connect the components
118: # After agent_flow completes, go to supervisor (this is a default transition)
119: agent_flow >> supervisor
120: 
121: # If supervisor rejects the answer (returns "retry"), go back to agent_flow
122: supervisor - "retry" >> agent_flow
123: 
124: # Create and return the outer flow
125: supervised_flow = Flow(start=agent_flow)
126: ```
127: Here:
128: *   `agent_flow >> supervisor`: If the `agent_flow` (which is treated as a single unit here) completes and its `post` method returns an action that is *not* specifically handled by `agent_flow` itself for transitions *within* it, or if it returns `None`, it will transition to the `supervisor` Node. This is a default transition.
129: *   `supervisor - "retry" >> agent_flow`: This is a specific action-based transition. If the `supervisor` Node's `post` method returns `"retry"`, the flow goes back to `agent_flow`.
130: 
131: If a Node's `post` returns `None`, and there's a default transition defined (e.g., `node1 >> node2`), then `node2` will be executed. If there's no specific transition for the returned action *and* no default transition, the [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) typically ends for that branch.
132: 
133: ## What Happens Under the Hood? (A Simplified View)
134: 
135: 1.  **Node Execution:** Your [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) runs a [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md).
136: 2.  **`post` Method Returns Action:** The `post` method of that [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) completes and returns an action string (e.g., `"search"`).
137: 3.  **Flow Receives Action:** The [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) (specifically, its orchestrator logic) gets this action string.
138: 4.  **Lookup Successor:** The [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) looks at the current [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) and checks its defined successors. Each [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) object internally stores a dictionary called `successors`. This dictionary maps action strings to the next [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) object.
139:     *   The syntax `node1 - "actionX" >> node2` effectively does `node1.successors["actionX"] = node2`.
140:     *   The syntax `node1 >> node2` effectively does `node1.successors["default"] = node2`.
141: 5.  **Find Next Node:** The [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) tries to find an entry in `current_node.successors` for the returned action string. If not found, it tries to find an entry for `"default"`.
142: 6.  **Transition or End:**
143:     *   If a next [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) is found, the [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) prepares to execute it.
144:     *   If no matching transition (neither specific nor default) is found, that path of the [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) typically concludes.

163: 
164: **Diving into the Code (from `pocketflow/__init__.py`):**
165: 
166: 1.  **Storing Transitions:**
167:     The `BaseNode` class (which all [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) and [Flows (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) inherit from) has a `next` method to define successors:
168:     ```python
169:     # Inside BaseNode class (pocketflow/__init__.py)
170:     class BaseNode:
171:         def __init__(self): 
172:             self.successors = {} # Stores action -> next_node mapping
173:             # ... other initializations ...
174:         
175:         def next(self, node, action="default"):
176:             # ... (warning if overwriting) ...
177:             self.successors[action] = node
178:             return node # Allows chaining
179:     ```
180:     The cool `node - "action" >> next_node` syntax is made possible by Python's special methods (`__sub__` for `-` and `__rshift__` for `>>`):
181:     ```python
182:     # Inside BaseNode class (pocketflow/__init__.py)
183:     def __sub__(self, action_str): # When you do 'node - "action_str"'
184:         if isinstance(action_str, str):
185:             return _ConditionalTransition(self, action_str)
186:         # ... error handling ...
187: 
188:     class _ConditionalTransition: # A temporary helper object
189:         def __init__(self, src_node, action_name):
190:             self.src_node, self.action_name = src_node, action_name
191:         
192:         def __rshift__(self, target_node): # When you do '... >> target_node'
193:             return self.src_node.next(target_node, self.action_name)
194:     ```
195:     And for the default transition `node1 >> node2`:
196:     ```python
197:     # Inside BaseNode class (pocketflow/__init__.py)
198:     def __rshift__(self, other_node): # When you do 'node1 >> other_node'
199:         return self.next(other_node) # Calls .next() with action="default"
200:     ```
201:     So, these operators are just convenient ways to populate the `successors` dictionary of a [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md).
202: 
203: 2.  **Flow Orchestration and Using Actions:**
204:     The `Flow` class has an `_orch` (orchestration) method that manages running [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) in sequence.
205:     ```python
206:     # Inside Flow class (pocketflow/__init__.py)
207:     class Flow(BaseNode):
208:         # ...
209:         def get_next_node(self, current_node, action_str):
210:             # Tries the specific action, then "default"
211:             next_node = current_node.successors.get(action_str)
212:             if not next_node: # If specific action not found
213:                  next_node = current_node.successors.get("default")
214: 
215:             # ... (warning if action not found and successors exist) ...
216:             return next_node
217: 
218:         def _orch(self, shared, params=None):
219:             current_node = self.start_node 
220:             last_action = None
221:             while current_node:
222:                 # ... (set params for current_node) ...
223:                 last_action = current_node._run(shared) # Node returns an action
224:                 current_node = self.get_next_node(current_node, last_action)
225:             return last_action # Returns the last action from the entire flow
226:     ```
227:     The `_orch` method:
228:     *   Starts with the `self.start_node`.
229:     *   In a loop, it runs the `current_node` (whose `_run` method calls `prep`, `exec`, and `post`). The `post` method's return value becomes `last_action`.
230:     *   It then calls `self.get_next_node(current_node, last_action)` to determine the next [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md).
231:     *   If `get_next_node` returns a [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md), the loop continues. If it returns `None` (no transition found), the loop (and thus the flow for that path) ends.
232: 
233: ## Analogy: A Mail Sorter
234: 
235: Think of a [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) as a mail processing station.
236: *   It receives a package (data via `prep` from the [shared dictionary](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md)).
237: *   It processes the package (its `exec` method).
238: *   Then, its `post` method looks at the package and decides which destination bin it should go to next. It writes a "destination code" (the action string like `"LOCAL_DELIVERY"` or `"INTERNATIONAL_FORWARD"`) on the package.
239: *   The [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) is like the conveyor belt system. It reads the "destination code" and uses its routing rules (the `node - "code" >> next_station` definitions) to send the package to the correct next station. If there's no specific code, it might send it to a "default processing" station.
240: 
241: ## Conclusion
242: 
243: Actions and Transitions are the control flow mechanism in PocketFlow. They allow you to build dynamic and responsive workflows where the path of execution can change based on the outcomes of individual [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md).
244: *   A [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md)'s `post` method returns an **action string**.
245: *   The [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md) uses this action string to find a **transition rule** (e.g., `current_node - "action" >> next_node` or a default `current_node >> next_node`).
246: *   This determines the next [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) to execute.
247: 
248: By mastering actions and transitions, you can design sophisticated logic for your AI agents, enabling them to make decisions and navigate complex tasks.
249: 
250: Now that we understand how individual [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) are defined, how they share data using the [shared dictionary](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md), and how they connect using Actions and Transitions, we're ready to look at the bigger picture: the container that orchestrates all of this.

  8: # Chapter 4: Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 3: Actions / Transitions](03_actions___transitions__.md), we saw how individual [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) can decide what should happen next by returning "action" strings, and how these actions lead to "transitions" between Nodes. But what actually manages this sequence? What's the conductor of this orchestra of Nodes? That's where **Flows** come in!
 11: 
 12: ## What Problem Do Flows Solve? Meet the Orchestrator!
 13: 
 14: Imagine you're building a simple AI application that interacts with a user:
 15: 1.  **Greet User Node**: Displays a welcome message.
 16: 2.  **Get Name Node**: Asks the user for their name and stores it.
 17: 3.  **Personalized Message Node**: Uses the name to give a personalized response.
 18: 
 19: Each step is a [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md). But how do you ensure they run in the correct order? How does the "Get Name Node" know to run after "Greet User Node", and how is the name passed along? This is the job of a **Flow**.
 20: 
 21: A **Flow** is like the **blueprint** or the **manager** of an assembly line. It defines the sequence of operations by connecting multiple [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) into a complete workflow. It dictates:
 22: *   Which [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) starts the process.
 23: *   How to move from one [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) to another based on the [Actions / Transitions](03_actions___transitions__.md) we learned about.
 24: *   It ensures the [shared dictionary](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md) is passed along, so all [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) have access to the data they need.
 25: 
 26: PocketFlow offers two main types of Flows:
 27: *   **`Flow`**: For workflows that consist primarily of synchronous [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) (tasks that run one after another, blocking until complete).
 28: *   **`AsyncFlow`**: For workflows that include asynchronous [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) (tasks that can "pause" and let other operations run, like waiting for user input or a network request).
 29: 
 30: Let's see how to build and use them!
 31: 
 32: ## Building Your First `Flow`
 33: 
 34: Let's create a simple text transformation workflow using `Flow`. It will:
 35: 1.  Get text input from the user.
 36: 2.  Offer transformation choices (uppercase, lowercase, etc.).
 37: 3.  Transform the text.
 38: 4.  Ask if the user wants to do another transformation or exit.
 39: 
 40: This example is inspired by `cookbook/pocketflow-flow/flow.py`.
 41: 
 42: **Step 1: Define Your Nodes**
 43: 
 44: First, we need our worker [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md). (We'll use conceptual Node definitions here for brevity; refer to [Chapter 2](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) for Node details).
 45: 
 46: ```python
 47: # Assume these Nodes are defined (simplified from cookbook/pocketflow-flow/flow.py)
 48: # from pocketflow import Node
 49: 
 50: class TextInput(Node): # Gets input and choice
 51:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 52:         # ... (gets user input for text and choice) ...
 53:         # shared["text"] = user_text
 54:         # shared["choice"] = user_choice
 55:         if shared["choice"] == "5": # Exit choice
 56:             return "exit"
 57:         return "transform" # Action to proceed to transformation
 58: 
 59: class TextTransform(Node): # Transforms text based on choice
 60:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 61:         # ... (transforms text, prints result) ...
 62:         # shared["transformed_text"] = result
 63:         if input("Convert another? (y/n): ") == 'y':
 64:             shared.pop("text", None) # Clear for next input
 65:             return "input" # Action to go back to TextInput
 66:         return "exit" # Action to end
 67: 
 68: class EndNode(Node): # A simple Node to mark the end
 69:     pass
 70: ```
 71: *   `TextInput`: Its `post` method will return `"transform"` to move to the `TextTransform` Node, or `"exit"`.
 72: *   `TextTransform`: Its `post` method will return `"input"` to loop back to `TextInput`, or `"exit"`.
 73: 
 74: **Step 2: Instantiate Your Nodes**
 75: 
 76: Create an instance of each Node class:
 77: ```python
 78: text_input = TextInput()
 79: text_transform = TextTransform()
 80: end_node = EndNode()
 81: ```
 82: 
 83: **Step 3: Connect Nodes Using Transitions**
 84: 
 85: Now, tell PocketFlow how these [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) connect based on the actions they return. We learned this in [Chapter 3: Actions / Transitions](03_actions___transitions__.md).
 86: 
 87: ```python
 88: # If text_input returns "transform", go to text_transform
 89: text_input - "transform" >> text_transform
 90: # If text_input returns "exit" (or any other unhandled action by default for this setup)
 91: # we'll eventually want it to go to end_node or the flow just ends.
 92: # For simplicity here, let's make "exit" explicit if we want a dedicated end.
 93: text_input - "exit" >> end_node # Or simply let it end if no "exit" transition
 94: 
 95: # If text_transform returns "input", go back to text_input
 96: text_transform - "input" >> text_input
 97: # If text_transform returns "exit", go to end_node
 98: text_transform - "exit" >> end_node
 99: ```
100: 
101: **Step 4: Create the `Flow`**
102: 
103: Now, create an instance of the `Flow` class, telling it which [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) to start with.
104: 
105: ```python
106: from pocketflow import Flow
107: 
108: # Create the flow, starting with the text_input node
109: app_flow = Flow(start=text_input)
110: ```
111: And that's it! `app_flow` is now a complete, runnable workflow.
112: 
113: **Step 5: Run the `Flow`**
114: 
115: To execute your workflow, you call its `run` method, usually with an initial [shared dictionary](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md).
116: 
117: ```python
118: initial_shared_data = {} # Start with an empty shared dictionary
119: app_flow.run(initial_shared_data)
120: 
121: # After the flow finishes, initial_shared_data might contain final results
122: # if your nodes were designed to store them there.
123: print("Flow finished!")
124: ```
125: When you run this:
126: 1.  `app_flow` will start with `text_input`.
127: 2.  `text_input` will execute (prompting you for text and choice).
128: 3.  Based on the action returned by `text_input` (e.g., `"transform"`), the `Flow` will look at the transitions you defined and execute the next [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) (e.g., `text_transform`).
129: 4.  This continues until a [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) returns an action for which no transition is defined, or it transitions to a [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) like `end_node` that doesn't lead anywhere else.
130: 
131: ## Orchestrating Asynchronous Tasks with `AsyncFlow`
132: 
133: What if your workflow involves tasks that wait for external operations, like fetching data from a website or waiting for a user to type something slowly? If you use a regular `Flow` and synchronous [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) for these, your whole application would freeze during these waits.
134: 
135: This is where `AsyncFlow` and [Asynchronous Processing (`AsyncNode`, `AsyncFlow`)](05_asynchronous_processing___asyncnode____asyncflow___.md) come in. `AsyncFlow` is designed to work with `AsyncNode`s, which can perform tasks asynchronously.
136: 
137: Let's look at a conceptual recipe finder flow (inspired by `cookbook/pocketflow-async-basic/flow.py`).
138: 
139: **Step 1: Define Your AsyncNodes**
140: You'd define [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) using `AsyncNode` and `async def` methods.
141: 
142: ```python
143: # from pocketflow import AsyncNode, Node
144: 
145: class FetchRecipes(AsyncNode): # Gets ingredient & fetches recipes (async)
146:     async def post_async(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
147:         # ... (stores recipes in shared) ...
148:         return "suggest" # Action to suggest a recipe
149: 
150: class SuggestRecipe(Node): # Suggests a recipe (can be sync)
151:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
152:         # ... (prints suggestion) ...
153:         return "approve" # Action to get approval
154: 
155: class GetApproval(AsyncNode): # Gets user approval (async)
156:     async def post_async(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
157:         # ... (gets approval) ...
158:         if approved: return "accept"
159:         return "retry" # Action to suggest another
160: 
161: class EndFlowNode(Node): pass # Simple synchronous end node
162: ```
163: 
164: **Step 2 & 3: Instantiate and Connect**
165: This is very similar to `Flow`:
166: 
167: ```python
168: fetch_recipes = FetchRecipes()
169: suggest_recipe = SuggestRecipe()
170: get_approval = GetApproval()
171: end_node = EndFlowNode()
172: 
173: fetch_recipes - "suggest" >> suggest_recipe
174: suggest_recipe - "approve" >> get_approval
175: get_approval - "retry" >> suggest_recipe # Loop back
176: get_approval - "accept" >> end_node
177: ```
178: 
179: **Step 4: Create the `AsyncFlow`**
180: 
181: ```python
182: from pocketflow import AsyncFlow
183: 
184: recipe_flow = AsyncFlow(start=fetch_recipes)
185: ```
186: Notice we use `AsyncFlow` here.
187: 
188: **Step 5: Run the `AsyncFlow`**
189: 
190: Running an `AsyncFlow` involves `async` and `await` because the flow itself is asynchronous.
191: 
192: ```python
193: import asyncio
194: 
195: async def main():
196:     initial_shared = {}
197:     await recipe_flow.run_async(initial_shared) # Use run_async()
198:     print("Recipe flow finished!")
199: 
200: # To run the main async function
201: # asyncio.run(main())
202: ```
203: The `AsyncFlow` will manage the `AsyncNode`s, allowing them to `await` their operations without blocking the entire event loop (if you're running other async tasks). We'll explore this more in [Chapter 5: Asynchronous Processing (`AsyncNode`, `AsyncFlow`)](05_asynchronous_processing___asyncnode____asyncflow___.md).
204: 
205: ## Nesting Flows: Managing Complexity
206: 
207: What if your workflow becomes very large and complex? You can break it down! A **Flow can itself be treated as a Node and nested within another Flow.** This is like having a project manager who oversees several team leads, and each team lead manages their own team's tasks.
208: 
209: Consider the `cookbook/pocketflow-supervisor/flow.py` example. It has an `agent_inner_flow` which handles research, and then an outer `Flow` that uses this `agent_inner_flow` as a step, followed by a `SupervisorNode` to check the agent's work.
210: 
211: ```python
212: # Conceptual: from cookbook/pocketflow-supervisor/flow.py
213: # agent_inner_flow is a complete Flow instance itself
214: agent_inner_flow = create_agent_inner_flow() 
215: supervisor = SupervisorNode()
216: 
217: # The inner flow is treated like a node in the outer flow's transitions
218: agent_inner_flow >> supervisor # Default transition
219: supervisor - "retry" >> agent_inner_flow
220: 
221: supervised_flow = Flow(start=agent_inner_flow)
222: ```
223: Here, `agent_inner_flow` runs completely. When it finishes, the `supervised_flow` transitions to the `supervisor` Node. This is a powerful way to create hierarchical and modular workflows.
224: 
225: ## Under the Hood: How Do Flows Orchestrate?
226: 
227: At its core, a `Flow` (or `AsyncFlow`) runs a loop that:
228: 1.  Identifies the current [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) to run (starting with its `start_node`).
229: 2.  Executes this [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) (which involves its `prep`, `exec`, and `post` methods).
230: 3.  Gets the "action" string returned by the Node's `post` method.
231: 4.  Uses this action string to look up the *next* [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) based on the transitions you defined (e.g., `current_node - "action" >> next_node`).
232: 5.  If a next [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) is found, it becomes the current [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md), and the loop continues.
233: 6.  If no next [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) is found (no matching transition), the flow (or that branch of it) ends.
234: 
235: Here's a simplified sequence diagram:
236: 
237: ```mermaid
238: sequenceDiagram

256: ```
257: 
258: **A Glimpse into the Code (`pocketflow/__init__.py`):**
259: 
260: The `Flow` class inherits from `BaseNode`, so it also has `prep`, `exec`, `post` methods. Its main job is done in its orchestration logic.
261: 
262: 1.  **Initialization:** When you create a `Flow`, you give it a starting [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md).
263:     ```python
264:     # Inside Flow class
265:     def __init__(self, start=None):
266:         super().__init__() # Initialize BaseNode parts
267:         self.start_node = start # Store the starting node
268:     ```
269: 
270: 2.  **Getting the Next Node:** The `get_next_node` method is crucial. It checks the current node's `successors` dictionary (which was populated by your transition definitions like `nodeA - "action" >> nodeB`).
271:     ```python
272:     # Inside Flow class
273:     def get_next_node(self, current_node, action_str):
274:         # Try specific action, then "default"
275:         next_node = current_node.successors.get(action_str)
276:         if not next_node: # If specific action's successor not found
277:             next_node = current_node.successors.get("default")
278:         # ... (warnings if no successor found but some exist) ...
279:         return next_node
280:     ```
281: 
282: 3.  **The Orchestration Loop (`_orch`):** This is the heart of the `Flow`.
283:     ```python
284:     # Inside Flow class (simplified)
285:     def _orch(self, shared, params=None):
286:         current_node = self.start_node 
287:         last_action = None
288:         while current_node:
289:             # ... (set parameters for current_node if any) ...
290:             last_action = current_node._run(shared) # Run the node
291:             # Get the next node based on the action from the current one
292:             current_node = self.get_next_node(current_node, last_action)
293:         return last_action # Returns the very last action from the flow
294:     ```
295:     The `current_node._run(shared)` call is what executes the `prep -> exec -> post` cycle of that [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md).
296: 
297: For `AsyncFlow`, the structure is very similar. It has an `_orch_async` method:
298: ```python
299: # Inside AsyncFlow class (conceptual)
300: async def _orch_async(self, shared, params=None):
301:     current_node = self.start_node
302:     last_action = None
303:     while current_node:
304:         # ...
305:         if isinstance(current_node, AsyncNode):
306:             last_action = await current_node._run_async(shared) # Await async nodes
307:         else:
308:             last_action = current_node._run(shared) # Run sync nodes normally
309:         current_node = self.get_next_node(current_node, last_action)
310:     return last_action
311: ```
312: The key difference is that it `await`s the `_run_async` method of `AsyncNode`s, allowing for non-blocking execution.
313: 
314: ## Conclusion
315: 
316: You've now learned about **`Flow`** and **`AsyncFlow`**, the orchestrators that bring your [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) together to form complete, dynamic workflows!
317: *   Flows define the sequence and logic of how [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) are executed.
318: *   They use the "action" strings returned by [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) and the transition rules you define (e.g., `nodeA - "action" >> nodeB`) to decide the path of execution.
319: *   `Flow` is for synchronous workflows, while `AsyncFlow` handles workflows with asynchronous tasks using `AsyncNode`s.
320: *   Flows can be nested to manage complexity.
321: 
322: With Flows, you can build anything from simple linear sequences to complex, branching, and looping AI applications.
323: 
324: In the next chapter, we'll take a much deeper dive into the world of asynchronous operations specifically, exploring how `AsyncNode` and `AsyncFlow` enable you to build responsive, I/O-bound applications efficiently.

  8: # Chapter 5: Asynchronous Processing (`AsyncNode`, `AsyncFlow`)
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 4: Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md), we learned how `Flow` and `AsyncFlow` orchestrate sequences of [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) to create complete applications. Now, we're going to zoom in on a powerful feature that `AsyncFlow` enables: **Asynchronous Processing**. This is key to building AI applications that feel responsive and can handle tasks that involve waiting, like calling web APIs or interacting with users.
 11: 
 12: ## The Problem: Waiting Can Be Wasteful!
 13: 
 14: Imagine you're building an AI assistant that needs to:
 15: 1.  Ask the user for a city name.
 16: 2.  Fetch the current weather for that city from an online weather service (this involves a network request, which can take a few seconds).
 17: 3.  Tell the user the weather.
 18: 
 19: If we build this "synchronously" (one step strictly after the other, waiting for each to finish), your application would *freeze* while it's waiting for the weather service. The user can't do anything else; the app just hangs. This isn't a great experience!
 20: 
 21: This is where asynchronous processing helps. It's like a skilled chef in a busy kitchen.
 22: *   A **synchronous chef** would prepare one dish from start to finish: chop vegetables, put it on the stove, wait for it to simmer, then plate it. Only *after* that one dish is completely done would they start the next. If simmering takes 20 minutes, they're just standing there waiting!
 23: *   An **asynchronous chef** is much more efficient! They can start chopping vegetables for dish A, put it on the stove to simmer, and *while it's simmering* (a waiting period), they can start preparing dish B, or perhaps clean up. They don't idly wait; they switch to other tasks that can be done.
 24: 
 25: PocketFlow's `AsyncNode` and `AsyncFlow` let your AI application be like that efficient, asynchronous chef.
 26: 
 27: ## What is Asynchronous Processing?
 28: 
 29: Asynchronous processing allows your program to start a potentially long-running task (like an API call or waiting for user input) and then, instead of freezing and waiting for it to complete, it can switch to doing other work. When the long-running task eventually finishes, the program can pick up where it left off with that task.
 30: 
 31: This is especially crucial for **I/O-bound tasks**. "I/O" stands for Input/Output, like:
 32: *   Reading/writing files from a disk.
 33: *   Making requests over a network (e.g., to an LLM API, a database, or a web service).
 34: *   Waiting for user input.
 35: 
 36: These tasks often involve waiting for something external to the program itself. Asynchronous processing ensures your application remains responsive and can handle multiple things (seemingly) at once, improving overall throughput and user experience.
 37: 
 38: In Python, this is often achieved using the `async` and `await` keywords.
 39: *   `async def` is used to define an asynchronous function (also called a "coroutine").
 40: *   `await` is used inside an `async` function to pause its execution until an awaited task (another coroutine or an I/O operation) completes. While paused, other asynchronous tasks can run.
 41: 
 42: ## Meet `AsyncNode`: The Asynchronous Worker
 43: 
 44: In PocketFlow, an `AsyncNode` is a special type of [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) designed for asynchronous operations. It looks very similar to a regular `Node`, but its core methods (`prep`, `exec`, `post`) are defined as `async` functions:
 45: 
 46: *   `async def prep_async(self, shared)`
 47: *   `async def exec_async(self, prep_res)`
 48: *   `async def post_async(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res)`
 49: 
 50: Inside these methods, you can use `await` to call other asynchronous functions or perform non-blocking I/O operations.
 51: 
 52: Let's create a simple `AsyncNode` that simulates fetching data from a website. We'll use `asyncio.sleep()` to mimic the delay of a network request.
 53: 
 54: ```python
 55: import asyncio
 56: from pocketflow import AsyncNode
 57: 
 58: class WeatherFetcherNode(AsyncNode):
 59:     async def prep_async(self, shared):
 60:         city = shared.get("city_name", "Unknown city")
 61:         print(f"WeatherFetcherNode: Preparing to fetch weather for {city}.")
 62:         return city
 63: 
 64:     async def exec_async(self, city):
 65:         print(f"WeatherFetcherNode: Calling weather API for {city}...")
 66:         await asyncio.sleep(2) # Simulate a 2-second API call
 67:         weather_data = f"Sunny in {city}"
 68:         print(f"WeatherFetcherNode: Got weather: {weather_data}")
 69:         return weather_data
 70: 
 71:     async def post_async(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 72:         shared["weather_report"] = exec_res
 73:         print(f"WeatherFetcherNode: Weather report stored in shared.")
 74:         return "done" # Action to signify completion
 75: ```
 76: In this `WeatherFetcherNode`:
 77: *   All methods are `async def`.
 78: *   `exec_async` uses `await asyncio.sleep(2)` to pause for 2 seconds. If this were a real application, it might be `await http_client.get(...)`. While this `await` is active, other asynchronous tasks in your program could run.
 79: 
 80: ## Orchestrating with `AsyncFlow`
 81: 
 82: To run `AsyncNode`s, you need an `AsyncFlow`. As we saw in [Chapter 4: Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md), an `AsyncFlow` can manage both `AsyncNode`s and regular `Node`s. When it encounters an `AsyncNode`, it will correctly `await` its asynchronous methods.
 83: 
 84: Let's set up an `AsyncFlow` to use our `WeatherFetcherNode`.
 85: 
 86: **1. Instantiate your Node(s):**
 87: ```python
 88: weather_node = WeatherFetcherNode()
 89: # You could have other nodes here, sync or async
 90: ```
 91: 
 92: **2. (Optional) Define Transitions:**
 93: If you have multiple nodes, you define transitions as usual. Since we only have one node, its returned action `"done"` will simply end this branch of the flow.
 94: 
 95: ```python
 96: # Example: weather_node - "done" >> some_other_node
 97: # For this example, we'll let it end.
 98: ```
 99: 
100: **3. Create the `AsyncFlow`:**
101: ```python
102: from pocketflow import AsyncFlow
103: 
104: weather_flow = AsyncFlow(start=weather_node)
105: ```
106: 
107: **4. Run the `AsyncFlow`:**
108: Running an `AsyncFlow` requires `await` because the flow itself is an asynchronous operation. You'll typically do this inside an `async` function.
109: 
110: ```python
111: # main.py
112: import asyncio
113: 
114: # Assume WeatherFetcherNode is defined as above
115: # Assume weather_flow is created as above
116: 
117: async def main():
118:     shared_data = {"city_name": "London"}
119:     print("Starting weather flow...")
120:     await weather_flow.run_async(shared_data) # Use run_async()
121:     print("Weather flow finished.")
122:     print(f"Final shared data: {shared_data}")
123: 
124: if __name__ == "__main__":
125:     asyncio.run(main()) # Standard way to run an async main function
126: ```
127: 
128: **Expected Output/Behavior:**
129: 
130: When you run `main.py`:
131: 1.  "Starting weather flow..." is printed.
132: 2.  `WeatherFetcherNode: Preparing to fetch weather for London.` is printed.
133: 3.  `WeatherFetcherNode: Calling weather API for London...` is printed.
134: 4.  The program will *pause* here for about 2 seconds (due to `await asyncio.sleep(2)`). If other `async` tasks were scheduled, Python's event loop could run them during this time.
135: 5.  After 2 seconds:
136:     *   `WeatherFetcherNode: Got weather: Sunny in London` is printed.
137:     *   `WeatherFetcherNode: Weather report stored in shared.` is printed.
138: 6.  "Weather flow finished." is printed.
139: 7.  `Final shared data: {'city_name': 'London', 'weather_report': 'Sunny in London'}` is printed.
140: 
141: The key is that during the 2-second "API call," a well-structured asynchronous application wouldn't be frozen. It could be handling other user requests, updating a UI, or performing other background tasks.
142: 
143: ## What Happens Under the Hood?
144: 
145: When an `AsyncFlow` runs an `AsyncNode`, it leverages Python's `asyncio` event loop.
146: 
147: 1.  **`AsyncFlow` starts:** You call `await my_async_flow.run_async(shared)`.
148: 2.  **Node Execution:** The `AsyncFlow`'s orchestrator (`_orch_async`) identifies the current node.
149: 3.  **Calling `_run_async`:** If the current node is an `AsyncNode` (like our `WeatherFetcherNode`), the `AsyncFlow` calls `await current_node._run_async(shared)`.
150: 4.  **Inside `AsyncNode`:**
151:     *   `_run_async` calls `await self.prep_async(shared)`.
152:     *   Then, `await self._exec(prep_result)` (which internally calls `await self.exec_async(prep_result)`).
153:     *   Finally, `await self.post_async(shared, prep_result, exec_result)`.
154: 5.  **The `await` Keyword:** When an `AsyncNode`'s method encounters an `await` statement (e.g., `await asyncio.sleep(2)` or `await some_api_call()`), execution of *that specific node's task* pauses. Control is yielded back to the `asyncio` event loop.
155: 6.  **Event Loop Magic:** The event loop can then run other pending asynchronous tasks. It keeps track of the paused task.
156: 7.  **Task Resumes:** When the awaited operation completes (e.g., `asyncio.sleep(2)` finishes, or the API responds), the event loop resumes the paused `AsyncNode` task from where it left off.
157: 8.  **Action and Next Node:** The `AsyncNode`'s `post_async` eventually returns an action, and the `AsyncFlow` determines the next node, continuing the process.
158:

180:     ANode-->>AFlow: Returns action (e.g., "done")
181:     AFlow-->>UserApp: Flow complete (shared is updated)
182: ```
183: 
184: **Diving into PocketFlow's Code (Simplified):**
185: 
186: *   **`AsyncNode`'s Execution (`pocketflow/__init__.py`):**
187:     The `AsyncNode` has an `_run_async` method:
188:     ```python
189:     # Inside AsyncNode class
190:     async def _run_async(self, shared):
191:         p = await self.prep_async(shared)
192:         e = await self._exec(p) # _exec calls exec_async with retries
193:         return await self.post_async(shared, p, e)
194:     ```
195:     And its `_exec` method handles calling `exec_async` (and retries, similar to `Node` but `async`):
196:     ```python
197:     # Inside AsyncNode class (simplified _exec)
198:     async def _exec(self, prep_res): 
199:         # ... (retry loop) ...
200:         try:
201:             return await self.exec_async(prep_res) # Key: await exec_async
202:         except Exception as e:
203:             # ... (fallback logic) ...
204:     ```
205: 
206: *   **`AsyncFlow`'s Orchestration (`pocketflow/__init__.py`):**
207:     The `AsyncFlow` has an `_orch_async` method that handles running nodes:
208:     ```python
209:     # Inside AsyncFlow class
210:     async def _orch_async(self, shared, params=None):
211:         curr, p, last_action = self.start_node, (params or {}), None
212:         while curr:
213:             # ... (set params for current node) ...
214:             if isinstance(curr, AsyncNode):
215:                 last_action = await curr._run_async(shared) # AWAIT AsyncNode
216:             else:
217:                 last_action = curr._run(shared) # Run sync Node normally
218:             curr = self.get_next_node(curr, last_action)
219:         return last_action
220:     ```
221:     Notice how it checks if `curr` is an `AsyncNode` and uses `await curr._run_async(shared)` if it is. Otherwise, for regular synchronous [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md), it calls `curr._run(shared)` directly.
222: 
223: ## Benefits of Asynchronous Processing
224: 
225: 1.  **Responsiveness:** Your application doesn't freeze while waiting for I/O tasks. This is vital for user interfaces or servers handling multiple requests.
226: 2.  **Improved Throughput:** For applications with many I/O-bound tasks (e.g., making multiple API calls), asynchronous processing allows these tasks to overlap their waiting periods, leading to faster overall completion. Imagine our chef preparing multiple simmering dishes at once!
227: 3.  **Efficient Resource Usage:** Threads can be resource-intensive. `asyncio` often uses a single thread more efficiently by switching between tasks during their I/O wait times.
228: 
229: Use `AsyncNode` and `AsyncFlow` when your workflow involves tasks that spend significant time waiting for external operations.
230: 
231: ## Conclusion
232: 
233: You've now unlocked the power of asynchronous processing in PocketFlow with `AsyncNode` and `AsyncFlow`!
234: *   Asynchronous operations prevent your application from freezing during I/O-bound tasks like API calls.
235: *   `AsyncNode` defines its logic with `async def` methods (`prep_async`, `exec_async`, `post_async`) and uses `await` for non-blocking waits.
236: *   `AsyncFlow` orchestrates these `AsyncNode`s (and regular `Node`s) using `await flow.run_async()`.
237: *   This approach leads to more responsive and efficient applications, especially when dealing with network requests or user interactions.
238: 
239: This "asynchronous chef" model is incredibly useful. What if you have many similar items to process, perhaps even asynchronously and in parallel? That's where batch processing comes in.

  8: # Chapter 6: Batch Processing (`BatchNode`, `BatchFlow`, `AsyncParallelBatchNode`)
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 5: Asynchronous Processing (`AsyncNode`, `AsyncFlow`)](05_asynchronous_processing___asyncnode____asyncflow___.md), we explored how `AsyncNode` and `AsyncFlow` help build responsive applications that can handle waiting for tasks like API calls. Now, what if you need to perform a similar operation on *many* different items? For example, imagine you have a document, and you want to translate it into ten different languages. Doing this one by one, or even coordinating many asynchronous calls manually, can be cumbersome. PocketFlow provides specialized tools for exactly this: **Batch Processing**.
 11: 
 12: Batch processing in PocketFlow allows you to efficiently apply a piece of logic to a collection of items, simplifying the code and often improving performance, especially with parallel execution.
 13: 
 14: Our main use case for this chapter will be: **Translating a single document into multiple target languages.**
 15: 
 16: Let's explore the tools PocketFlow offers for this:
 17: 
 18: ## 1. `BatchNode`: The Sequential Worker for Batches
 19: 
 20: A `BatchNode` is designed to process a list of items one after the other (sequentially). It's like a meticulous librarian who takes a stack of books and processes each one individually before moving to the next.
 21: 
 22: **How it Works:**
 23: 1.  **`prep(self, shared)`**: This method is responsible for preparing your list of individual items to be processed. It should return an iterable (like a list) where each element is a single item for processing.
 24: 2.  **`exec(self, item)`**: This method is called *for each individual item* returned by `prep`. It contains the logic to process that single `item`.
 25: 3.  **`post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list)`**: After all items have been processed by `exec`, this method is called. `exec_res_list` will be a list containing the results from each call to `exec`, in the same order as the input items.
 26: 
 27: **Example: Processing a Large CSV in Chunks**
 28: 
 29: Let's look at `CSVProcessor` from `cookbook/pocketflow-batch-node/nodes.py`. It reads a large CSV file not all at once, but in smaller "chunks" (batches of rows).
 30: 
 31: ```python
 32: # cookbook/pocketflow-batch-node/nodes.py
 33: import pandas as pd
 34: from pocketflow import BatchNode
 35: 
 36: class CSVProcessor(BatchNode):
 37:     def __init__(self, chunk_size=1000):
 38:         super().__init__()
 39:         self.chunk_size = chunk_size
 40:     
 41:     def prep(self, shared):
 42:         # Returns an iterator of DataFrame chunks
 43:         chunks = pd.read_csv(
 44:             shared["input_file"], chunksize=self.chunk_size
 45:         )
 46:         return chunks # Each 'chunk' is an item
 47: 
 48:     def exec(self, chunk): # Called for each chunk
 49:         # Process one chunk (a pandas DataFrame)
 50:         return { "total_sales": chunk["amount"].sum(), # ... more stats ... 
 51:         }
 52: 
 53:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list):
 54:         # exec_res_list contains results from all chunks
 55:         # ... (combine statistics from all chunks) ...
 56:         shared["statistics"] = { # ... final aggregated stats ... 
 57:         }
 58:         return "show_stats"
 59: ```
 60: *   `prep`: Reads the CSV specified in `shared["input_file"]` and returns an iterator where each item is a `DataFrame` (a chunk of rows).
 61: *   `exec`: Takes one `chunk` (a `DataFrame`) and calculates some statistics for it. This method will be called multiple times, once for each chunk from `prep`.
 62: *   `post`: Receives `exec_res_list`, which is a list of dictionaries (one from each `exec` call). It then aggregates these results and stores the final statistics in `shared`.
 63: 
 64: This `BatchNode` processes each chunk sequentially.
 65: 
 66: ## 2. `AsyncParallelBatchNode`: The Concurrent Worker for Batches
 67: 
 68: What if processing each item involves waiting (like an API call), and you want to do them concurrently to save time? That's where `AsyncParallelBatchNode` comes in. It's like `BatchNode` but for asynchronous operations that can run in parallel. Imagine a team of librarians, each given a book from the stack, processing them all at the same time.
 69: 
 70: **How it Works:**
 71: 1.  **`async def prep_async(self, shared)`**: Similar to `BatchNode.prep`, but asynchronous. It returns a list of items to be processed.
 72: 2.  **`async def exec_async(self, item)`**: This asynchronous method is called for each item. PocketFlow will use `asyncio.gather` to run these `exec_async` calls concurrently for all items.
 73: 3.  **`async def post_async(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list)`**: Called after all `exec_async` calls have completed. `exec_res_list` contains their results.
 74: 
 75: **Solving Our Use Case: Translating a Document into Multiple Languages**
 76: 
 77: The `AsyncParallelBatchNode` is perfect for our document translation task. Let's look at `TranslateTextNodeParallel` from `cookbook/pocketflow-parallel-batch/main.py`.
 78: 
 79: ```python
 80: # cookbook/pocketflow-parallel-batch/main.py (simplified)
 81: from pocketflow import AsyncFlow, AsyncParallelBatchNode
 82: # from utils import call_llm # Assumed async LLM call
 83: 
 84: class TranslateTextNodeParallel(AsyncParallelBatchNode):
 85:     async def prep_async(self, shared):
 86:         text = shared.get("text", "")
 87:         languages = shared.get("languages", [])
 88:         # Create a list of (text_to_translate, target_language) tuples
 89:         return [(text, lang) for lang in languages]
 90: 
 91:     async def exec_async(self, data_tuple):
 92:         text, language = data_tuple # One (text, language) pair
 93:         # prompt = f"Translate '{text}' to {language}..."
 94:         # result = await call_llm(prompt) # Call LLM API
 95:         print(f"Translated to {language}") # Simplified
 96:         return {"language": language, "translation": f"Translated: {language}"}
 97: 
 98:     async def post_async(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list):
 99:         # exec_res_list has all translation results
100:         # ... (code to save each translation to a file) ...
101:         print(f"All {len(exec_res_list)} translations processed.")
102:         return "default" # Or some other action
103: 
104: # To run this, you'd typically wrap it in an AsyncFlow:
105: # translate_node = TranslateTextNodeParallel()
106: # translation_flow = AsyncFlow(start=translate_node)
107: # await translation_flow.run_async(shared_data_with_text_and_languages)
108: ```
109: In this example:
110: *   `prep_async`: Takes the document `text` and a list of `languages` from `shared`. It returns a list of tuples, e.g., `[(original_text, "Spanish"), (original_text, "French"), ...]`. Each tuple is an "item" for `exec_async`.
111: *   `exec_async`: Takes one `(text, language)` tuple, calls an asynchronous LLM function (`call_llm`) to perform the translation, and returns a dictionary with the result. Because this is an `AsyncParallelBatchNode`, PocketFlow will try to run these LLM calls for all languages concurrently!
112: *   `post_async`: Gets the list of all translation results and, in the full example, saves them to files.
113: 
114: This drastically speeds up the overall translation process compared to doing them one by one.
115: 
116: ## 3. `BatchFlow`: Running a Sub-Workflow Multiple Times
117: 
118: Sometimes, the "logic" you want to apply to a collection isn't just a single `exec` method, but a whole sub-workflow (which could be a single [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) or a more complex [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md)). You want to run this sub-workflow multiple times, each time with slightly different *parameters*. This is what `BatchFlow` is for.
119: 
120: Think of a film director who has a specific scene (the sub-workflow) and wants to shoot it multiple times, but each time with different actors or lighting (the parameters).
121: 
122: **How it Works:**
123: 1.  The `BatchFlow` is initialized with a `start` component, which is the sub-workflow (a [Node (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md) or [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md)) to be run multiple times.
124: 2.  **`prep(self, shared)`**: This method of the `BatchFlow` itself should return a list of parameter dictionaries. Each dictionary represents one "run" of the sub-workflow.
125: 3.  For each parameter dictionary from `prep`, the `BatchFlow` executes its `start` component (the sub-workflow). The parameters from the dictionary are made available to the sub-workflow for that particular run, usually merged into its `shared` context or node `params`.
126: 4.  **`post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res)`**: This is called after all batch executions of the sub-workflow are done. Note: `exec_res` here is often `None` because the results of each sub-workflow execution are typically handled within those sub-workflows by writing to `shared`.
127: 
128: **Example: Applying Different Filters to Multiple Images**
129: 
130: Consider `cookbook/pocketflow-batch-flow/flow.py`. We want to process several images, applying a different filter to each (or multiple filters to each image).
131: 
132: First, a base [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md) defines how to process *one* image with *one* filter:
133: ```python
134: # cookbook/pocketflow-batch-flow/flow.py (simplified base_flow)
135: # from pocketflow import Flow
136: # from nodes import LoadImage, ApplyFilter, SaveImage
137: 
138: def create_base_flow(): # This is our sub-workflow
139:     load = LoadImage()
140:     filter_node = ApplyFilter()
141:     save = SaveImage()
142:     
143:     load - "apply_filter" >> filter_node
144:     filter_node - "save" >> save
145:     return Flow(start=load) # Base flow for one image-filter pair
146: ```
147: 
148: Now, the `ImageBatchFlow`:
149: ```python
150: # cookbook/pocketflow-batch-flow/flow.py (ImageBatchFlow)
151: # from pocketflow import BatchFlow
152: 
153: class ImageBatchFlow(BatchFlow):
154:     def prep(self, shared):
155:         images = ["cat.jpg", "dog.jpg"]
156:         filters = ["grayscale", "blur"]
157:         params = [] # List of parameter dictionaries
158:         for img in images:
159:             for f in filters:
160:                 # Each dict is one set of params for the base_flow
161:                 params.append({"input_image_path": img, "filter_type": f})
162:         return params
163: 
164: # How to use it:
165: # base_processing_logic = create_base_flow()
166: # image_processor = ImageBatchFlow(start=base_processing_logic)
167: # image_processor.run(initial_shared_data)
168: ```
169: *   `ImageBatchFlow.prep`: Generates a list of parameter dictionaries. Each dictionary specifies an input image and a filter type, e.g., `[{"input_image_path": "cat.jpg", "filter_type": "grayscale"}, {"input_image_path": "cat.jpg", "filter_type": "blur"}, ...]`.
170: *   When `image_processor.run()` is called, the `base_processing_logic` ([Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md)) will be executed for *each* of these parameter dictionaries. The `LoadImage` node inside `base_processing_logic` would then use `params["input_image_path"]`, and `ApplyFilter` would use `params["filter_type"]`.
171: 
172: ## 4. `AsyncParallelBatchFlow`: Running Sub-Workflows in Parallel
173: 
174: Just as `AsyncParallelBatchNode` is the concurrent version of `BatchNode`, `AsyncParallelBatchFlow` is the concurrent version of `BatchFlow`. It runs the multiple executions of its sub-workflow *in parallel*.
175: 
176: This is like having multiple film crews, each with their own set, shooting different variations of the same scene (sub-workflow with different parameters) all at the same time.
177: 
178: **How it Works:**
179: Similar to `BatchFlow`, but:
180: 1.  Uses `async def prep_async(self, shared)` to generate the list of parameter dictionaries.
181: 2.  When run with `await my_flow.run_async()`, it executes the sub-workflow for each parameter set concurrently using `asyncio.gather`.
182: 
183: **Example: Parallel Image Processing with Filters**
184: The `cookbook/pocketflow-parallel-batch-flow/flow.py` shows an `ImageParallelBatchFlow`.
185: ```python
186: # cookbook/pocketflow-parallel-batch-flow/flow.py (Conceptual)
187: # from pocketflow import AsyncParallelBatchFlow
188: # from nodes import LoadImageAsync, ApplyFilterAsync, SaveImageAsync 
189: # (assuming async versions of nodes for the base async flow)
190: 
191: # def create_async_base_flow(): ... returns an AsyncFlow ...
192: 
193: class ImageParallelBatchFlow(AsyncParallelBatchFlow):
194:     async def prep_async(self, shared):
195:         # ... (generates list of param dicts like before) ...
196:         # params.append({"image_path": img, "filter": f_type})
197:         return params
198: 
199: # How to use it:
200: # async_base_logic = create_async_base_flow() # An AsyncFlow
201: # parallel_processor = ImageParallelBatchFlow(start=async_base_logic)
202: # await parallel_processor.run_async(initial_shared_data)
203: ```
204: This would run the `async_base_logic` for each image-filter combination in parallel, potentially speeding up processing if the sub-workflow involves `await`able operations.
205: 
206: ## Under the Hood: A Glimpse
207: 
208: Let's briefly see how these batch components achieve their magic, using simplified logic.
209: 
210: **`BatchNode`**
211: Its `_exec` method essentially loops through the items from `prep` and calls its parent's `_exec` (which eventually calls your `exec` method) for each one.
212: ```python
213: # pocketflow/__init__.py (BatchNode simplified)
214: class BatchNode(Node):
215:     def _exec(self, items_from_prep):
216:         results = []
217:         for item in (items_from_prep or []):
218:             # Calls Node._exec(item), which calls self.exec(item)
219:             result_for_item = super(BatchNode, self)._exec(item)
220:             results.append(result_for_item)
221:         return results # This list becomes exec_res_list in post()
222: ```
223: 
224: **`AsyncParallelBatchNode`**
225: Its `_exec` method uses `asyncio.gather` to run the processing of all items concurrently.
226: ```python
227: # pocketflow/__init__.py (AsyncParallelBatchNode simplified)
228: class AsyncParallelBatchNode(AsyncNode, BatchNode): # Inherits from AsyncNode
229:     async def _exec(self, items_from_prep_async):
230:         tasks = []
231:         for item in items_from_prep_async:
232:             # Create a task for super()._exec(item)
233:             # super()._exec eventually calls self.exec_async(item)
234:             task = super(AsyncParallelBatchNode, self)._exec(item)
235:             tasks.append(task)
236:         return await asyncio.gather(*tasks) # Run all tasks concurrently
237: ```
238: ```mermaid
239: sequenceDiagram
240:     participant UserApp
241:     participant APBN as AsyncParallelBatchNode
242:     participant Item1Proc as exec_async(item1)
243:     participant Item2Proc as exec_async(item2)
244:     participant EventLoop
245: 
246:     UserApp->>APBN: await node.run_async(shared)
247:     APBN->>APBN: await self.prep_async(shared)
248:     Note right of APBN: Returns [item1, item2]
249:     APBN->>APBN: await self._exec([item1, item2])
250:     APBN->>EventLoop: asyncio.gather(exec_async(item1), exec_async(item2))
251:     EventLoop-->>Item1Proc: Start
252:     EventLoop-->>Item2Proc: Start
253:     Note over Item1Proc, Item2Proc: Both run concurrently
254:     Item1Proc-->>EventLoop: Done (result1)
255:     Item2Proc-->>EventLoop: Done (result2)
256:     EventLoop-->>APBN: Returns [result1, result2]
257:     APBN->>APBN: await self.post_async(shared, ..., [result1, result2])
258:     APBN-->>UserApp: Final action
259: ```
260: 
261: **`BatchFlow`**
262: Its `_run` method iterates through the parameter dictionaries from `prep` and, for each one, calls `_orch` (the standard [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md) orchestration method) to run its `start` component with those parameters.
263: ```python
264: # pocketflow/__init__.py (BatchFlow simplified)
265: class BatchFlow(Flow):
266:     def _run(self, shared):
267:         param_list = self.prep(shared) or []
268:         for param_set in param_list:
269:             # Run the entire sub-workflow (self.start_node)
270:             # with current param_set merged.
271:             # self.params are the BatchFlow's own params.
272:             merged_params = {**self.params, **param_set}
273:             self._orch(shared, merged_params) # _orch runs the sub-flow
274:         return self.post(shared, param_list, None)
275: ```
276: ```mermaid
277: sequenceDiagram
278:     participant UserApp
279:     participant BF as BatchFlow
280:     participant SubFlowOrch as Sub-Workflow Orchestration (_orch)
281:     
282:     UserApp->>BF: flow.run(shared)
283:     BF->>BF: self.prep(shared)
284:     Note right of BF: Returns [params1, params2]
285:     BF->>SubFlowOrch: _orch(shared, params1)
286:     Note right of SubFlowOrch: Sub-workflow runs with params1
287:     SubFlowOrch-->>BF: Completes
288:     BF->>SubFlowOrch: _orch(shared, params2)
289:     Note right of SubFlowOrch: Sub-workflow runs with params2
290:     SubFlowOrch-->>BF: Completes
291:     BF->>BF: self.post(shared, ...)
292:     BF-->>UserApp: Final action
293: ```
294: 
295: **`AsyncParallelBatchFlow`**
296: Its `_run_async` method is similar to `BatchFlow._run` but uses `asyncio.gather` to run all the `_orch_async` calls (for its sub-workflow) in parallel.
297: ```python
298: # pocketflow/__init__.py (AsyncParallelBatchFlow simplified)
299: class AsyncParallelBatchFlow(AsyncFlow, BatchFlow):
300:     async def _run_async(self, shared):
301:         param_list = await self.prep_async(shared) or []
302:         tasks = []
303:         for param_set in param_list:
304:             merged_params = {**self.params, **param_set}
305:             # Create a task for each sub-workflow run
306:             task = self._orch_async(shared, merged_params)
307:             tasks.append(task)
308:         await asyncio.gather(*tasks) # Run all sub-workflow instances concurrently
309:         return await self.post_async(shared, param_list, None)
310: ```
311: 
312: ## Conclusion
313: 
314: Batch processing tools in PocketFlow—`BatchNode`, `AsyncParallelBatchNode`, `BatchFlow`, and `AsyncParallelBatchFlow`—provide powerful and convenient ways to handle collections of items or run workflows multiple times with varying parameters.
315: *   Use **`BatchNode`** for sequential processing of a list of items where `exec` defines the logic for one item.
316: *   Use **`AsyncParallelBatchNode`** for concurrent processing of items, ideal for I/O-bound tasks like multiple API calls (our translation example).
317: *   Use **`BatchFlow`** when you have a sub-workflow that needs to be run multiple times sequentially, each time with different parameters.
318: *   Use **`AsyncParallelBatchFlow`** to run instances of a sub-workflow concurrently with different parameters.
319: 
320: These abstractions help keep your code clean, manage complexity, and leverage concurrency for better performance.
321: 
322: So far, we've seen how individual agents or flows can be constructed. But what if you need multiple, distinct AI agents to collaborate and communicate with each other?

  8: # Chapter 7: A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Communication Framework
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the final chapter of our PocketFlow journey! In [Chapter 6: Batch Processing (`BatchNode`, `BatchFlow`, `AsyncParallelBatchNode`)](06_batch_processing___batchnode____batchflow____asyncparallelbatchnode___.md), we saw how to process multiple items or run workflows repeatedly. Now, we'll explore how to make your PocketFlow agents available to the wider world, allowing them to communicate with other systems or agents using a standard "language."
 11: 
 12: ## The Challenge: Making Your Agent a Team Player
 13: 
 14: Imagine you've built a fantastic PocketFlow agent that can research topics and answer questions. It's great for your own use, but what if:
 15: *   Another team in your company wants their AI system to ask questions of your agent?
 16: *   You want to offer your agent's capabilities as a service that other applications can call?
 17: *   You want to build a larger system composed of multiple specialized agents that need to collaborate?
 18: 
 19: These scenarios require a **standardized way for agents to talk to each other**. Simply sharing Python code or relying on custom integrations isn't scalable or interoperable. This is where the **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Communication Framework** comes in.
 20: 
 21: **Our Use Case:** We want to take the PocketFlow-based research agent we've been conceptualizing (which uses [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) and a [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md)) and make it accessible via a standard A2A interface. Another program (a client) should be able to send it a question (e.g., "What is PocketFlow?") and receive an answer, all using this A2A standard.
 22: 
 23: The A2A framework in PocketFlow provides components that wrap your agent, allowing it to understand and speak the A2A JSON-RPC specification. Think of it like giving your agent a universal translator and a public phone line.
 24: 
 25: ## Key Components of the A2A Framework
 26: 
 27: The A2A framework in `PocketFlow` consists of a few main parts that work together:
 28: 
 29: 1.  **A2A JSON-RPC Specification (The "Language")**: This isn't code, but a standard agreement on how agents communicate. It uses JSON-RPC, a lightweight remote procedure call protocol using JSON. It defines methods like `tasks/send` (to give an agent a job) and `tasks/get` (to check on a job), and the structure of messages. PocketFlow's A2A components adhere to this spec.
 30:     *   **Analogy**: If agents are from different countries, JSON-RPC is the agreed-upon common language (like Esperanto or English as a lingua franca) they'll use to talk.
 31: 
 32: 2.  **Common `types` (The "Vocabulary and Grammar")**: These are pre-defined Python Pydantic models (found in `cookbook/pocketflow-a2a/common/types.py`) that represent the structure of all A2A messages. This includes `Task`, `Message`, `Artifact`, `TextPart`, `JSONRPCRequest`, `JSONRPCResponse`, etc. Using these types ensures that both the client and server understand the format of the data being exchanged.
 33:     *   **Analogy**: These are the specific words and sentence structures within the agreed-upon language.
 34: 
 35: 3.  **`A2AServer` (The "Receptionist")**: This component hosts your PocketFlow agent. It listens for incoming A2A requests over HTTP, understands the A2A JSON-RPC protocol, and passes the work to your agent (via the `TaskManager`).
 36:     *   **Analogy**: The `A2AServer` is like the public-facing receptionist for your PocketFlow agent. It answers the "phone" (HTTP requests) and speaks the standard A2A language.
 37: 
 38: 4.  **`TaskManager` (The "Internal Translator")**: This is the crucial bridge. It receives instructions from the `A2AServer` (which are in the A2A format), translates them into something your PocketFlow [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md) can understand (typically by preparing the [shared dictionary](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md)), runs your PocketFlow [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md), and then takes the results from the [shared dictionary](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md) and packages them back into the A2A format for the `A2AServer` to send out.
 39:     *   **Analogy**: If your PocketFlow agent only speaks "PocketFlow-ese," the `TaskManager` is the internal assistant who translates A2A language from the receptionist into PocketFlow-ese and vice-versa.
 40: 
 41: 5.  **`A2AClient` (The "Caller")**: This component allows you (or another system) to interact with an agent hosted by an `A2AServer`. It knows how to formulate A2A JSON-RPC requests and understand the responses.
 42:     *   **Analogy**: The `A2AClient` is someone using the public phone line to call your agent's receptionist.
 43: 
 44: Let's see how to use these to make our PocketFlow research agent accessible.
 45: 
 46: ## Making Your PocketFlow Agent A2A-Compatible
 47: 
 48: Let's assume you've already built your core PocketFlow agent using [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md) and a [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md), perhaps similar to the one in `cookbook/pocketflow-a2a/flow.py` that can take a question and produce an answer. The main function in `flow.py` to get this flow is `create_agent_flow()`.
 49: 
 50: **Step 1: Create Your `TaskManager`**
 51: 
 52: The `TaskManager` connects the A2A world to your PocketFlow [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md). We'll create a `PocketFlowTaskManager` that inherits from a base `InMemoryTaskManager` (which handles storing task states).
 53: 
 54: Here's a simplified look at `PocketFlowTaskManager` from `cookbook/pocketflow-a2a/task_manager.py`:
 55: 
 56: ```python
 57: # In task_manager.py
 58: from common.server.task_manager import InMemoryTaskManager
 59: from common.types import ( # A2A standard message types
 60:     SendTaskRequest, SendTaskResponse, TaskState, TaskStatus,
 61:     TextPart, Artifact, Message
 62: )
 63: from flow import create_agent_flow # Your PocketFlow agent logic
 64: 
 65: class PocketFlowTaskManager(InMemoryTaskManager):
 66:     async def on_send_task(self, request: SendTaskRequest) -> SendTaskResponse:
 67:         # 1. Get the question from the A2A request
 68:         query = self._get_user_query(request.params) # Helper to extract text
 69:         if not query:
 70:             # ... handle error: no query found ...
 71: 
 72:         # 2. Prepare shared data for your PocketFlow agent
 73:         shared_data = {"question": query}
 74:         agent_flow = create_agent_flow() # Get your PocketFlow flow
 75: 
 76:         # 3. Run your PocketFlow agent
 77:         try:
 78:             agent_flow.run(shared_data) # This modifies shared_data
 79:             # 'shared_data' now contains the answer, e.g., shared_data["answer"]
 80:         except Exception as e:
 81:             # ... handle agent execution error ...
 82: 
 83:         # 4. Package the result into A2A format
 84:         answer_text = shared_data.get("answer", "No answer.")
 85:         final_status = TaskStatus(state=TaskState.COMPLETED)
 86:         final_artifact = Artifact(parts=[TextPart(text=answer_text)])
 87:         
 88:         # Store final task details (InMemoryTaskManager helps here)
 89:         final_task = await self.update_store(
 90:             request.params.id, final_status, [final_artifact]
 91:         )
 92:         return SendTaskResponse(id=request.id, result=final_task)
 93: 
 94:     def _get_user_query(self, task_params) -> str | None:
 95:         # Simplified: Extracts text from the A2A message parts
 96:         # (Actual code in common/types.py & task_manager.py is more robust)
 97:         if task_params.message and task_params.message.parts:
 98:             for part in task_params.message.parts:
 99:                 if part.type == "text": # Assuming part is a Pydantic model
100:                     return part.text
101:         return None
102: ```
103: **Explanation:**
104: *   `on_send_task`: This method is called when the `A2AServer` receives a `tasks/send` request.
105: *   It extracts the user's question from the A2A request's `message.parts` (using `_get_user_query`).
106: *   It prepares the [shared dictionary](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md) (`shared_data`) for your PocketFlow [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow___.md).
107: *   It runs your `agent_flow` with this `shared_data`. The `agent_flow` does its work and puts the answer back into `shared_data["answer"]`.
108: *   It retrieves the answer from `shared_data` and packages it into an A2A `Artifact` with a `TextPart`.
109: *   It updates the task's status to `COMPLETED` and returns an A2A `SendTaskResponse` containing the final `Task` object (which includes the answer artifact).
110: 
111: **Step 2: Set Up the `A2AServer`**
112: 
113: Now, we need to host our `PocketFlowTaskManager` using `A2AServer`. This involves defining an `AgentCard` (metadata about your agent) and starting the server.
114: 
115: A simplified `main` function from `cookbook/pocketflow-a2a/a2a_server.py`:
116: ```python
117: # In a2a_server.py
118: from common.server import A2AServer
119: from common.types import AgentCard, AgentCapabilities, AgentSkill # For metadata
120: from task_manager import PocketFlowTaskManager # Your task manager
121: import os
122: 
123: def main(host="localhost", port=10003):
124:     # (Error checking for API keys like OPENAI_API_KEY happens here)
125:     
126:     # 1. Define Agent's "Business Card" (AgentCard)
127:     capabilities = AgentCapabilities(streaming=False) # Our agent isn't streaming
128:     skill = AgentSkill(
129:         id="web_research_qa", name="Web Research and Answering",
130:         # ... (more skill details: description, examples) ...
131:         inputModes=["text"], outputModes=["text"]
132:     )
133:     agent_card = AgentCard(
134:         name="PocketFlow Research Agent (A2A)",
135:         url=f"http://{host}:{port}/", # Where clients connect
136:         # ... (more card details: description, version, skills) ...
137:         capabilities=capabilities, skills=[skill]
138:     )
139: 
140:     # 2. Initialize TaskManager and Server
141:     task_manager = PocketFlowTaskManager()
142:     server = A2AServer(
143:         agent_card=agent_card,
144:         task_manager=task_manager,
145:         host=host, port=port,
146:     )
147: 
148:     print(f"Starting PocketFlow A2A server on http://{host}:{port}")
149:     server.start() # This starts the HTTP server (e.g., Uvicorn)
150: 
151: if __name__ == "__main__":
152:     # This would typically call main()
153:     # For example: main()
154:     pass
155: ```
156: **Explanation:**
157: *   `AgentCard`: This provides metadata about your agent (name, URL, capabilities, skills offered). Other A2A systems can fetch this card (from `/.well-known/agent.json`) to learn about your agent.
158: *   We instantiate our `PocketFlowTaskManager`.
159: *   We create an `A2AServer`, giving it the `agent_card`, our `task_manager`, and the `host`/`port` to listen on.
160: *   `server.start()` launches the web server. Now your PocketFlow agent is listening for A2A requests!
161: 
162: **Step 3: Interact Using an `A2AClient`**
163: 
164: With the server running, other programs can now "call" your agent. The `A2AClient` helps with this.
165: 
166: A simplified CLI client from `cookbook/pocketflow-a2a/a2a_client.py`:
167: ```python
168: # In a2a_client.py
169: import asyncio
170: from common.client import A2AClient # The A2A client utility
171: from common.types import TextPart # To structure our question
172: 
173: async def run_client(agent_url="http://localhost:10003"):
174:     client = A2AClient(url=agent_url)
175:     
176:     # Get question from user
177:     question_text = input("Enter your question: ")
178:     if not question_text: return
179: 
180:     # 1. Prepare the A2A request payload (matches TaskSendParams)
181:     # This is a simplified representation of the common.types.TaskSendParams
182:     payload = {
183:         "id": "some_unique_task_id", # Each task needs an ID
184:         "message": {
185:             "role": "user",
186:             "parts": [{"type": "text", "text": question_text}], # Our question
187:         },
188:         "acceptedOutputModes": ["text"], # We want text back
189:     }
190: 
191:     print("Sending task to agent...")
192:     try:
193:         # 2. Send the task to the server
194:         response = await client.send_task(payload) # This makes the HTTP call
195: 
196:         # 3. Process the response
197:         if response.error:
198:             print(f"Error from agent: {response.error.message}")
199:         elif response.result and response.result.artifacts:
200:             # Extract answer from the first text part of the first artifact
201:             answer_part = response.result.artifacts[0].parts[0]
202:             if isinstance(answer_part, TextPart) or answer_part.type == "text":
203:                 print(f"Agent Answer: {answer_part.text}")
204:         else:
205:             print("Agent did not return a clear answer.")
206:             
207:     except Exception as e:
208:         print(f"Client error: {e}")
209: 
210: # To run this:
211: # if __name__ == "__main__":
212: # asyncio.run(run_client())
213: ```
214: **Explanation:**
215: *   An `A2AClient` is initialized with the server's URL.
216: *   A `payload` dictionary is created. This structure matches the A2A specification for sending a task (specifically, `TaskSendParams` from `common.types`). Our question is placed in `message.parts` as a `TextPart`.
217: *   `client.send_task(payload)` sends the JSON-RPC request to the `A2AServer`.
218: *   The response (an A2A `Task` object) is processed. The answer is typically found in the `artifacts` of the `Task`.
219: 
220: **Example Interaction:**
221: 1.  You run `a2a_server.py`. It starts listening on `http://localhost:10003`.
222: 2.  You run `a2a_client.py`.
223: 3.  Client prompts: `Enter your question:`
224: 4.  You type: `What is PocketFlow?`
225: 5.  Client sends this to the server.
226: 6.  Server (via `PocketFlowTaskManager` and your `agent_flow`) processes it.
227: 7.  Client receives the response and might print: `Agent Answer: PocketFlow is a minimalist LLM framework...`
228: 
229: Your PocketFlow agent is now communicating via a standard A2A interface!
230: 
231: ## Under the Hood: The A2A Conversation Flow
232: 
233: Let's trace a request from client to server and back:
234: 
235: 1.  **Client Prepares**: The `A2AClient` takes your input (e.g., a question) and constructs a JSON object according to the A2A spec. This is a JSON-RPC request, often for the method `tasks/send`.
236:     *   `A2AClient._send_request` (from `common/client/client.py`) assembles this. It uses `httpx` to make an HTTP POST request to the server's URL, with the JSON-RPC payload.
237: 
238: 2.  **Server Receives**: The `A2AServer` (built with Starlette) receives the HTTP POST request.
239:     *   `A2AServer._process_request` (from `common/server/server.py`) handles this. It parses the JSON body into an `A2ARequest` Pydantic model (e.g., `SendTaskRequest`).
240: 
241: 3.  **Server Routes to TaskManager**: Based on the JSON-RPC method in the request (e.g., `tasks/send`), the `A2AServer` calls the corresponding method on your `TaskManager`.
242:     *   E.g., for `tasks/send`, it calls `task_manager.on_send_task(request_model)`.
243: 
244: 4.  **TaskManager -> PocketFlow**: Your `PocketFlowTaskManager`'s `on_send_task` method:
245:     *   Extracts relevant data (like the question) from the `request_model`.
246:     *   Prepares the [shared dictionary](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md) for your PocketFlow [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md).
247:     *   Calls `your_pocketflow_flow.run(shared)`.
248: 
249: 5.  **PocketFlow Executes**: Your PocketFlow [Flow (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md) runs its [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode__.md), using and updating the [shared dictionary](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md). The final answer is placed in `shared` (e.g., `shared["answer"]`).
250: 
251: 6.  **PocketFlow -> TaskManager**: Control returns to `PocketFlowTaskManager`. It:
252:     *   Retrieves the result (e.g., `shared["answer"]`).
253:     *   Constructs an A2A `Task` object (from `common.types`), including `Artifacts` containing the answer.
254: 
255: 7.  **TaskManager -> Server**: The `TaskManager` returns the populated `Task` object (wrapped in a `JSONRPCResponse` model) to the `A2AServer`.
256: 
257: 8.  **Server Responds**: The `A2AServer` serializes the `JSONRPCResponse` (which contains the `Task` with the answer) back into a JSON string.
258:     *   It sends this JSON as the body of an HTTP 200 OK response back to the client.
259: 
260: 9.  **Client Processes**: The `A2AClient` receives the HTTP response.
261:     *   It parses the JSON body into its own Pydantic models (e.g., `SendTaskResponse` containing the `Task`).
262:     *   It extracts the answer from the `Task`'s artifacts for you to see.
263: 
264: Here's a simplified sequence diagram of this interaction:
265: 
266: ```mermaid
267: sequenceDiagram
268:     participant UserApp as User App (e.g., CLI)
269:     participant Client as A2AClient
270:     participant Server as A2AServer
271:     participant TaskMgr as PocketFlowTaskManager
272:     participant PF_Flow as Your PocketFlow Flow
273: 
274:     UserApp->>Client: User provides question
275:     Client->>Server: HTTP POST / (JSON-RPC: tasks/send {question})
276:     Server->>TaskMgr: on_send_task(a2a_request_with_question)
277:     TaskMgr->>PF_Flow: flow.run(shared={"question": ...})
278:     Note over PF_Flow: Flow processes, puts answer in shared
279:     PF_Flow-->>TaskMgr: Returns (shared modified with answer)
280:     TaskMgr->>TaskMgr: Creates A2A Task object with answer
281:     TaskMgr-->>Server: Returns A2A Task object
282:     Server-->>Client: HTTP 200 OK (JSON-RPC response {A2A Task with answer})
283:     Client->>UserApp: Displays answer from A2A Task
284: ```
285: 
286: **Key Code Snippets (Highly Simplified):**
287: 
288: *   **`A2AClient` sending request (from `common/client/client.py`):**
289:     ```python
290:     # Inside A2AClient
291:     async def _send_request(self, request_model: JSONRPCRequest) -> dict:
292:         # request_model is e.g., SendTaskRequest
293:         payload = request_model.model_dump(exclude_none=True)
294:         # self.fetchImpl is an httpx.AsyncClient
295:         http_response = await self.fetchImpl.post(self.url, json=payload)
296:         http_response.raise_for_status() # Check for HTTP errors
297:         return http_response.json() # Return parsed JSON response
298:     ```
299:     This shows the client converting a Pydantic model to a dictionary (`payload`) and sending it via HTTP.
300: 
301: *   **`A2AServer` processing request (from `common/server/server.py`):**
302:     ```python
303:     # Inside A2AServer
304:     async def _process_request(self, http_request: Request):
305:         raw_body = await http_request.body()
306:         parsed_body = json.loads(raw_body)
307:         # A2ARequest.validate_python converts dict to Pydantic model
308:         a2a_request_model = A2ARequest.validate_python(parsed_body)
309: 
310:         if isinstance(a2a_request_model, SendTaskRequest):
311:             # self.task_manager is your PocketFlowTaskManager
312:             result_model = await self.task_manager.on_send_task(a2a_request_model)
313:         # ... (other request types like GetTaskRequest) ...
314:         
315:         # result_model is e.g., SendTaskResponse
316:         return JSONResponse(result_model.model_dump(exclude_none=True))
317:     ```
318:     This shows the server parsing the incoming JSON, converting it to a Pydantic model, and calling the appropriate `TaskManager` method.
319: 
320: ## Conclusion: Your Agent is Now a Global Citizen!
321: 
322: You've reached the end of our PocketFlow tutorial series! With the **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Communication Framework**, you've learned how to:
323: *   Understand the roles of `A2AServer`, `A2AClient`, and `TaskManager`.
324: *   Wrap your existing PocketFlow [Flows (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md) with a `TaskManager` to handle A2A requests and responses.
325: *   Host your agent using `A2AServer`, making it accessible via a standard JSON-RPC interface.
326: *   Use `A2AClient` to interact with A2A-compatible agents.
327: 
328: This framework transforms your PocketFlow agent from a standalone application into a component that can integrate with larger systems and collaborate with other agents, regardless of how they are built internally, as long as they speak the A2A language.
329: 
330: **Reflecting on Your PocketFlow Journey:**
331: 
332: Throughout this tutorial, you've explored the core concepts of PocketFlow:
333: *   Managing data with the [Shared State (`shared` dictionary)](01_shared_state___shared__dictionary__.md).
334: *   Building modular tasks with [Nodes (`BaseNode`, `Node`, `AsyncNode`)](02_node___basenode____node____asyncnode___.md).
335: *   Creating dynamic workflows with [Actions / Transitions](03_actions___transitions_.md).
336: *   Orchestrating nodes into powerful [Flows (`Flow`, `AsyncFlow`)](04_flow___flow____asyncflow__.md).
337: *   Handling I/O-bound tasks efficiently with [Asynchronous Processing (`AsyncNode`, `AsyncFlow`)](05_asynchronous_processing___asyncnode____asyncflow___.md).
338: *   Processing collections of data using [Batch Processing (`BatchNode`, `BatchFlow`, `AsyncParallelBatchNode`)](06_batch_processing___batchnode____batchflow____asyncparallelbatchnode___.md).
339: *   And finally, enabling standardized inter-agent communication with the A2A framework.
340: 
341: You now have a solid foundation to build sophisticated, modular, and interoperable AI applications with PocketFlow. The world of intelligent agents awaits your creativity! Happy building!

12: PocketFlow<sup>[View Repo](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow)</sup> is a *Python framework* for building modular workflows and AI agents.
13: It allows you to define complex processes by connecting individual **Nodes**, which represent *atomic tasks* like calling an LLM or searching the web.
14: A **Flow** then *orchestrates* these Nodes, guiding the execution sequence based on **Actions** (string identifiers) returned by each Node.
15: Data is passed between Nodes and managed throughout the workflow execution via a **Shared State** (a Python dictionary).
16: PocketFlow also offers advanced features like **Batch Processing** for efficiently handling collections of items, and **Asynchronous Processing** for non-blocking operations crucial for I/O-bound tasks.
17: Additionally, it demonstrates an **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Communication Framework** to wrap PocketFlow agents, enabling them to communicate with other systems using a standardized JSON-RPC protocol.

  8: # Chapter 1: BaseModel - Your Data Blueprint
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the Pydantic tutorial! We're excited to guide you through the powerful features of Pydantic, starting with the absolute core concept: `BaseModel`.
 11: 
 12: ## Why Do We Need Structured Data?
 13: 
 14: Imagine you're building a web application. You receive data from users – maybe their name and age when they sign up. This data might come as JSON, form data, or just plain Python dictionaries.
 15: 
 16: ```json
 17: // Example user data from an API
 18: {
 19:   "username": "cool_cat_123",
 20:   "age": "28", // Oops, age is a string!
 21:   "email": "cat@example.com"
 22: }
 23: ```
 24: 
 25: How do you make sure this data is correct? Is `username` always provided? Is `age` actually a number, or could it be text like `"twenty-eight"`? Handling all these checks manually can be tedious and error-prone.
 26: 
 27: This is where Pydantic and `BaseModel` come in!
 28: 
 29: ## Introducing `BaseModel`: The Blueprint
 30: 
 31: Think of `BaseModel` as a **blueprint** for your data. You define the structure you expect – what fields should exist and what their types should be (like `string`, `integer`, `boolean`, etc.). Pydantic then uses this blueprint to automatically:
 32: 
 33: 1.  **Parse:** Read incoming data (like a dictionary).
 34: 2.  **Validate:** Check if the data matches your blueprint (e.g., is `age` really an integer?). If not, it tells you exactly what's wrong.
 35: 3.  **Serialize:** Convert your structured data back into simple formats (like a dictionary or JSON) when you need to send it somewhere else.
 36: 
 37: It's like having an automatic quality checker and translator for your data!
 38: 
 39: ## Defining Your First Model
 40: 
 41: Let's create a blueprint for a simple `User`. We want each user to have a `name` (which should be text) and an `age` (which should be a whole number).
 42: 
 43: In Pydantic, you do this by creating a class that inherits from `BaseModel` and using standard Python type hints:
 44: 
 45: ```python
 46: # Import BaseModel from Pydantic
 47: from pydantic import BaseModel
 48: 
 49: # Define your data blueprint (Model)
 50: class User(BaseModel):
 51:     name: str  # The user's name must be a string
 52:     age: int   # The user's age must be an integer
 53: ```
 54: 
 55: That's it! This simple class `User` is now a Pydantic model. It acts as the blueprint for creating user objects.
 56: 
 57: ## Using Your `BaseModel` Blueprint
 58: 
 59: Now that we have our `User` blueprint, let's see how to use it.
 60: 
 61: ### Creating Instances (Parsing and Validation)
 62: 
 63: You create instances of your model just like any regular Python class, passing the data as keyword arguments. Pydantic automatically parses and validates the data against your type hints (`name: str`, `age: int`).
 64: 
 65: **1. Valid Data:**
 66: 
 67: ```python
 68: # Input data (e.g., from a dictionary)
 69: user_data = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
 70: 
 71: # Create a User instance
 72: user_alice = User(**user_data) # The ** unpacks the dictionary
 73: 
 74: # Pydantic checked that 'name' is a string and 'age' is an integer.
 75: # It worked! Let's see the created object.
 76: print(user_alice)
 77: # Expected Output: name='Alice' age=30
 78: ```
 79: 
 80: Behind the scenes, Pydantic looked at `user_data`, compared it to the `User` blueprint, saw that `'Alice'` is a valid `str` and `30` is a valid `int`, and created the `user_alice` object.
 81: 
 82: **2. Invalid Data:**
 83: 
 84: What happens if the data doesn't match the blueprint?
 85: 
 86: ```python
 87: from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError
 88: 
 89: class User(BaseModel):
 90:     name: str
 91:     age: int
 92: 
 93: # Input data with age as a string that isn't a number
 94: invalid_data = {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 'twenty-eight'}
 95: 
 96: try:
 97:     user_bob = User(**invalid_data)
 98: except ValidationError as e:
 99:     print(e)
100:     """
101:     Expected Output (simplified):
102:     1 validation error for User
103:     age
104:       Input should be a valid integer, unable to parse string as an integer [type=int_parsing, input_value='twenty-eight', input_type=str]
105:     """
106: ```
107: 
108: Pydantic catches the error! Because `'twenty-eight'` cannot be understood as an `int` for the `age` field, it raises a helpful `ValidationError` telling you exactly which field (`age`) failed and why.
109: 
110: **3. Type Coercion (Smart Conversion):**
111: 
112: Pydantic is often smart enough to convert types when it makes sense. For example, if you provide `age` as a string containing digits:
113: 
114: ```python
115: from pydantic import BaseModel
116: 
117: class User(BaseModel):
118:     name: str
119:     age: int
120: 
121: # Input data with age as a numeric string
122: data_with_string_age = {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': '35'}
123: 
124: # Create a User instance
125: user_charlie = User(**data_with_string_age)
126: 
127: # Pydantic converted the string '35' into the integer 35!
128: print(user_charlie)
129: # Expected Output: name='Charlie' age=35
130: print(type(user_charlie.age))
131: # Expected Output: <class 'int'>
132: ```
133: 
134: Pydantic automatically *coerced* the string `'35'` into the integer `35` because the blueprint specified `age: int`. This leniency is often very convenient.
135: 
136: ### Accessing Data
137: 
138: Once you have a valid model instance, you access its data using standard attribute access:
139: 
140: ```python
141: # Continuing from the user_alice example:
142: print(f"User's Name: {user_alice.name}")
143: # Expected Output: User's Name: Alice
144: 
145: print(f"User's Age: {user_alice.age}")
146: # Expected Output: User's Age: 30
147: ```
148: 
149: ### Serialization (Converting Back)
150: 
151: Often, you'll need to convert your model instance back into a basic Python dictionary (e.g., to send it as JSON over a network). `BaseModel` provides easy ways to do this:
152: 
153: **1. `model_dump()`:** Converts the model to a dictionary.
154: 
155: ```python
156: # Continuing from the user_alice example:
157: user_dict = user_alice.model_dump()
158: 
159: print(user_dict)
160: # Expected Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
161: print(type(user_dict))
162: # Expected Output: <class 'dict'>
163: ```
164: 
165: **2. `model_dump_json()`:** Converts the model directly to a JSON string.
166: 
167: ```python
168: # Continuing from the user_alice example:
169: user_json = user_alice.model_dump_json(indent=2) # indent for pretty printing
170: 
171: print(user_json)
172: # Expected Output:
173: # {
174: #   "name": "Alice",
175: #   "age": 30
176: # }
177: print(type(user_json))
178: # Expected Output: <class 'str'>
179: ```
180: 
181: These methods allow you to easily share your structured data.
182: 
183: ## Under the Hood: How Does `BaseModel` Work?
184: 
185: You don't *need* to know the internals to use Pydantic effectively, but a little insight can be helpful!
186: 
187: **High-Level Steps:**
188: 
189: When Python creates your `User` class (which inherits from `BaseModel`), some Pydantic magic happens via its `ModelMetaclass`:
190: 
191: 1.  **Inspection:** Pydantic looks at your class definition (`User`), finding the fields (`name`, `age`) and their type hints (`str`, `int`).
192: 2.  **Schema Generation:** It generates an internal "Core Schema". This is a detailed, language-agnostic description of your data structure and validation rules. Think of it as an even more detailed blueprint used internally by Pydantic's fast validation engine (written in Rust!). We'll explore this more in [Chapter 5](05_core_schema___validation_serialization.md).
193: 3.  **Validator/Serializer Creation:** Based on this Core Schema, Pydantic creates highly optimized functions (internally) for validating input data and serializing model instances for *this specific model* (`User`).
194: 
195: Here's a simplified diagram:
196: 
197: ```mermaid
198: sequenceDiagram
199:     participant Dev as Developer
200:     participant Py as Python Interpreter
201:     participant Meta as BaseModel Metaclass
202:     participant Core as Pydantic Core Engine
203: 
204:     Dev->>Py: Define `class User(BaseModel): name: str, age: int`
205:     Py->>Meta: Ask to create the `User` class
206:     Meta->>Meta: Inspect fields (`name: str`, `age: int`)
207:     Meta->>Core: Request schema based on fields & types
208:     Core-->>Meta: Provide internal Core Schema for User
209:     Meta->>Core: Request validator function from schema
210:     Core-->>Meta: Provide optimized validator
211:     Meta->>Core: Request serializer function from schema
212:     Core-->>Meta: Provide optimized serializer
213:     Meta-->>Py: Return the fully prepared `User` class (with hidden validator/serializer attached)
214:     Py-->>Dev: `User` class is ready to use
215: ```
216: 
217: **Instantiation and Serialization Flow:**
218: 
219: *   When you call `User(name='Alice', age=30)`, Python calls the `User` class's `__init__` method. Pydantic intercepts this and uses the optimized **validator** created earlier to check the input data against the Core Schema. If valid, it creates the instance; otherwise, it raises `ValidationError`.
220: *   When you call `user_alice.model_dump()`, Pydantic uses the optimized **serializer** created earlier to convert the instance's data back into a dictionary, again following the rules defined in the Core Schema.
221: 
222: **Code Location:**
223: 
224: Most of this intricate setup logic happens within the `ModelMetaclass` found in `pydantic._internal._model_construction.py`. It coordinates with the `pydantic-core` Rust engine to build the schema and the validation/serialization logic.
225: 
226: ```python
227: # Extremely simplified conceptual view of metaclass action
228: class ModelMetaclass(type):
229:     def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace, **kwargs):
230:         # 1. Find fields and type hints in 'namespace'
231:         fields = {} # Simplified: find 'name: str', 'age: int'
232:         annotations = {} # Simplified
233: 
234:         # ... collect fields, config, etc. ...
235: 
236:         # 2. Generate Core Schema (pseudo-code)
237:         # core_schema = pydantic_core.generate_schema(fields, annotations, config)
238:         # (This happens internally, see Chapter 5)
239: 
240:         # 3. Create validator & serializer (pseudo-code)
241:         # validator = pydantic_core.SchemaValidator(core_schema)
242:         # serializer = pydantic_core.SchemaSerializer(core_schema)
243: 
244:         # Create the actual class object
245:         cls = super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace, **kwargs)
246: 
247:         # Attach the generated validator/serializer (simplified)
248:         # cls.__pydantic_validator__ = validator
249:         # cls.__pydantic_serializer__ = serializer
250:         # cls.__pydantic_core_schema__ = core_schema # Store the schema
251: 
252:         return cls
253: 
254: # class BaseModel(metaclass=ModelMetaclass):
255: #    ... rest of BaseModel implementation ...
256: ```
257: 
258: This setup ensures that validation and serialization are defined *once* when the class is created, making instance creation (`User(...)`) and dumping (`model_dump()`) very fast.
259: 
260: ## Conclusion
261: 
262: You've learned the fundamentals of `pydantic.BaseModel`:
263: 
264: *   It acts as a **blueprint** for your data structures.
265: *   You define fields and their types using standard **Python type hints**.
266: *   Pydantic automatically handles **parsing**, **validation** (with helpful errors), and **serialization** (`model_dump`, `model_dump_json`).
267: *   It uses a powerful internal **Core Schema** and optimized validators/serializers for great performance.
268: 
269: `BaseModel` is the cornerstone of Pydantic. Now that you understand the basics, you might be wondering how to add more specific validation rules (like "age must be positive") or control how fields are handled during serialization.
270: 
271: In the next chapter, we'll dive into customizing fields using the `Field` function.

  8: # Chapter 2: Customizing Your Blueprint's Rooms - Fields
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: BaseModel - Your Data Blueprint](01_basemodel.md), we learned how `BaseModel` acts like a blueprint for our data, defining the expected structure and types using simple Python type hints. We saw how Pydantic uses this blueprint to parse, validate, and serialize data.
 11: 
 12: But what if we need more specific instructions for certain parts of our blueprint? What if a room needs a specific paint color (a default value)? Or what if the blueprint uses one name for a room ("Lounge"), but the construction crew knows it by another name ("Living Room") (an alias)?
 13: 
 14: This is where Pydantic's **Fields** come in. They allow us to add these extra details and constraints to the attributes within our models.
 15: 
 16: ## Why Customize Fields?
 17: 
 18: Let's go back to our `User` model:
 19: 
 20: ```python
 21: from pydantic import BaseModel
 22: 
 23: class User(BaseModel):
 24:     name: str
 25:     age: int
 26: ```
 27: 
 28: This is great, but real-world data often has quirks:
 29: 
 30: 1.  **Missing Data:** What if `age` isn't always provided? Should it default to something sensible, like `18`?
 31: 2.  **Naming Conflicts:** What if the incoming data (e.g., JSON from a JavaScript frontend) uses `userName` instead of `name` (camelCase vs. snake_case)?
 32: 3.  **Basic Rules:** What if we know `age` must always be a positive number?
 33: 
 34: Simply using type hints (`str`, `int`) doesn't cover these cases. We need a way to add more *metadata* (extra information) to our fields.
 35: 
 36: ## Introducing `Field()`: Adding Notes to the Blueprint
 37: 
 38: Pydantic provides the `Field()` function precisely for this purpose. You use it as the *default value* when defining an attribute on your model, and pass arguments to it to specify the extra details.
 39: 
 40: Think of it like adding specific notes or requirements to a room on your building blueprint.
 41: 
 42: ```python
 43: # Import Field along with BaseModel
 44: from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
 45: 
 46: # Our User model, now with customizations using Field()
 47: class User(BaseModel):
 48:     name: str = Field(
 49:         default='Guest',       # Note 1: Default name is 'Guest'
 50:         alias='userName',      # Note 2: Expect 'userName' in input data
 51:         min_length=3           # Note 3: Name must be at least 3 characters
 52:     )
 53:     age: int = Field(
 54:         default=18,            # Note 1: Default age is 18
 55:         gt=0                   # Note 2: Age must be greater than 0
 56:     )
 57:     email: str | None = Field(
 58:         default=None,          # Note 3: Email is optional (defaults to None)
 59:         description='The user email address' # Note 4: Add a description
 60:     )
 61: ```
 62: 
 63: Let's break down how we use `Field()`:
 64: 
 65: 1.  **Import:** You need to import `Field` from `pydantic`.
 66: 2.  **Assignment:** Instead of just `name: str`, you write `name: str = Field(...)`. The `Field()` call replaces a simple default value (though `Field()` *can* specify a default).
 67: 3.  **Arguments:** You pass keyword arguments to `Field()` to specify the metadata:
 68:     *   `default`: Sets a default value if the field isn't provided in the input data. If you *only* need a default, you can often just write `name: str = 'Guest'` or `age: int = 18`, but `Field(default=...)` is useful when combined with other options. Use `...` (Ellipsis) or omit `default` entirely to mark a field as required.
 69:     *   `alias`: Tells Pydantic to look for this name (`'userName'`) in the input data (like a dictionary or JSON) when parsing, and use this alias when serializing (e.g., in `model_dump(by_alias=True)`).
 70:     *   `gt` (greater than), `ge` (greater than or equal), `lt` (less than), `le` (less than or equal): Basic numeric constraints.
 71:     *   `min_length`, `max_length`: Constraints for strings, lists, etc.
 72:     *   `description`: A human-readable description, often used for generating documentation or schemas.
 73:     *   ...and many more!
 74: 
 75: ## Using Models with `Field()`
 76: 
 77: Let's see how our customized `User` model behaves:
 78: 
 79: **1. Using Defaults:**
 80: 
 81: ```python
 82: from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
 83: 
 84: class User(BaseModel):
 85:     name: str = Field(default='Guest', alias='userName', min_length=3)
 86:     age: int = Field(default=18, gt=0)
 87:     email: str | None = Field(default=None, description='The user email address')
 88: 
 89: # Input data missing name and age
 90: input_data_1 = {'email': 'new@example.com'}
 91: 
 92: # Pydantic uses the defaults!
 93: user1 = User(**input_data_1)
 94: print(user1)
 95: # Expected Output: name='Guest' age=18 email='new@example.com'
 96: ```
 97: 
 98: Pydantic automatically filled in `name` and `age` using the `default` values we specified in `Field()`.
 99: 
100: **2. Using Aliases:**
101: 
102: ```python
103: # Continuing from above...
104: 
105: # Input data using the alias 'userName'
106: input_data_2 = {'userName': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
107: 
108: # Pydantic correctly uses the alias to populate 'name'
109: user2 = User(**input_data_2)
110: print(user2)
111: # Expected Output: name='Alice' age=30 email=None
112: 
113: # Dumping the model back, using the alias
114: print(user2.model_dump(by_alias=True))
115: # Expected Output: {'userName': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'email': None}
116: 
117: # Dumping without by_alias uses the actual field names
118: print(user2.model_dump())
119: # Expected Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'email': None}
120: ```
121: 
122: Pydantic successfully read the `userName` key from the input thanks to `alias='userName'`. When dumping *with* `by_alias=True`, it uses the alias again.
123: 
124: **3. Using Validation Constraints:**
125: 
126: ```python
127: # Continuing from above...
128: from pydantic import ValidationError
129: 
130: # Input data with invalid values
131: invalid_data_1 = {'userName': 'Bo', 'age': 30} # Name too short
132: invalid_data_2 = {'userName': 'Charlie', 'age': -5} # Age not > 0
133: 
134: try:
135:     User(**invalid_data_1)
136: except ValidationError as e:
137:     print(f"Error 1:\n{e}")
138:     """
139:     Expected Output (simplified):
140:     Error 1:

158: 
159: Pydantic enforced the `min_length=3` and `gt=0` constraints we added via `Field()`, giving helpful errors when the rules were violated.
160: 
161: ## What is `FieldInfo`? The Architect's Specification
162: 
163: So, you use the `Field()` function to add notes to your blueprint. But how does Pydantic *store* and *use* this information internally?
164: 
165: When Pydantic processes your model definition, it takes the information you provided in `Field()` (and the type hint) and bundles it all up into an internal object called `FieldInfo`.
166: 
167: **Analogy:** `Field()` is the sticky note you put on the blueprint ("Living Room - Must have fireplace"). `FieldInfo` is the formal entry in the architect's detailed specification document that captures this requirement along with the room's dimensions (type hint), default paint color (default value), etc.
168: 
169: You don't usually create `FieldInfo` objects directly. You use the convenient `Field()` function, and Pydantic creates the `FieldInfo` for you.
170: 
171: Every Pydantic model has a special attribute called `model_fields` which is a dictionary mapping field names to their corresponding `FieldInfo` objects.
172: 
173: ```python
174: # Continuing from the User model above
175: 
176: # Access the internal FieldInfo objects
177: print(User.model_fields['name'])
178: # Expected Output (representation may vary slightly):
179: # FieldInfo(annotation=str, required=False, default='Guest', alias='userName', alias_priority=2, validation_alias='userName', serialization_alias='userName', metadata=[MinLen(min_length=3)])
180: 
181: print(User.model_fields['age'])
182: # Expected Output:
183: # FieldInfo(annotation=int, required=False, default=18, metadata=[Gt(gt=0)])
184: 
185: print(User.model_fields['email'])
186: # Expected Output:
187: # FieldInfo(annotation=Union[str, NoneType], required=False, default=None, description='The user email address')
188: ```
189: 
190: You can see how the `FieldInfo` object holds all the details: the `annotation` (type), `default`, `alias`, `description`, and even the constraints like `MinLen(min_length=3)` and `Gt(gt=0)` stored in its `metadata` attribute.
191: 
192: ## Under the Hood: From `Field()` to `FieldInfo`
193: 
194: Let's revisit the model creation process from Chapter 1, now including `Field()`.
195: 
196: **High-Level Steps:**
197: 
198: When Python creates your `User` class:
199: 
200: 1.  **Inspection:** Pydantic's `ModelMetaclass` inspects the class definition. It finds `name: str = Field(alias='userName', ...)`, `age: int = Field(default=18, ...)`, etc.
201: 2.  **`FieldInfo` Creation:** For each attribute defined with `Field()`, Pydantic calls internal logic (like `FieldInfo.from_annotated_attribute`) using the type hint (`str`, `int`) and the result of the `Field(...)` call. This creates the `FieldInfo` object containing all the configuration (type, default, alias, constraints, etc.).
202: 3.  **Storage:** These `FieldInfo` objects are stored in an internal dictionary, which becomes accessible via `YourModel.model_fields`.
203: 4.  **Schema Generation:** Pydantic uses these comprehensive `FieldInfo` objects (along with model-level [Configuration](03_configuration__configdict___configwrapper_.md)) to generate the internal [Core Schema](05_core_schema___validation_serialization.md). This schema is the detailed instruction set for the fast validation and serialization engine.

223: ```
224: 
225: **Code Location:**
226: 
227: *   The `Field()` function itself is defined in `pydantic/fields.py`. It's a relatively simple function that just captures its arguments and returns a `FieldInfo` instance.
228: *   The `FieldInfo` class is also defined in `pydantic/fields.py`. It holds attributes like `annotation`, `default`, `alias`, `metadata`, etc.
229: *   The logic that finds fields in a class definition, handles the `Field()` assignments, and creates the `FieldInfo` objects primarily happens within the `collect_model_fields` function (in `pydantic._internal._fields.py`), which is called by the `ModelMetaclass` (in `pydantic._internal._model_construction.py`) during class creation.

311:     return fields, set() # Returns dict of field names to FieldInfo objects
312: 
313: ```
314: 
315: This process ensures that all the configuration you provide via `Field()` is captured systematically in `FieldInfo` objects, ready to be used for generating the validation/serialization schema.
316: 
317: ## Conclusion
318: 
319: You've now learned how to add detailed configuration to your `BaseModel` fields using the `Field()` function:
320: 
321: *   `Field()` allows you to specify **defaults**, **aliases**, basic **validation constraints** (like `gt`, `max_length`), **descriptions**, and more.
322: *   It acts like adding specific **notes or requirements** to the rooms in your data blueprint.
323: *   Internally, Pydantic captures this information in `FieldInfo` objects.
324: *   `FieldInfo` holds the complete specification for a field (type, default, alias, constraints, etc.) and is stored in the model's `model_fields` attribute.
325: *   This detailed `FieldInfo` is crucial for Pydantic's powerful validation and serialization capabilities.
326: 
327: You now have more control over individual fields. But what about configuring the overall behavior of the *entire* model? For example, how can we tell Pydantic to *always* use aliases when serializing, or to forbid extra fields not defined in the model? That's where model configuration comes in.

  8: # Chapter 3: Configuring Your Blueprint - Model Settings
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1](01_basemodel.md), we learned about `BaseModel` as our data blueprint, and in [Chapter 2](02_fields__fieldinfo___field_function_.md), we saw how `Field()` lets us add specific notes (like defaults or aliases) to individual rooms (fields) on that blueprint.
 11: 
 12: But what about instructions that apply to the *entire* blueprint? Imagine needing rules like:
 13: 
 14: *   "Absolutely no extra furniture allowed that's not in the plan!" (Forbid extra fields)
 15: *   "Once built, nothing inside can be changed!" (Make the model immutable/frozen)
 16: *   "All room names on the final report should be lowercase." (Apply a naming convention during output)
 17: 
 18: These are model-wide settings, not specific to just one field. Pydantic provides a way to configure this overall behavior using model configuration.
 19: 
 20: ## Why Configure the Whole Model?
 21: 
 22: Let's consider a simple `Product` model:
 23: 
 24: ```python
 25: from pydantic import BaseModel
 26: 
 27: class Product(BaseModel):
 28:     item_id: int
 29:     name: str
 30:     price: float | None = None
 31: ```
 32: 
 33: This works, but we might want to enforce stricter rules or change default behaviors:
 34: 
 35: 1.  **Strictness:** What if we receive data like `{'item_id': 123, 'name': 'Thingy', 'color': 'blue'}`? By default, Pydantic ignores the extra `color` field. We might want to *reject* data with unexpected fields.
 36: 2.  **Immutability:** What if, once a `Product` object is created, we want to prevent accidental changes like `product.price = 99.99`?
 37: 3.  **Naming Conventions:** What if our API expects JSON keys in `camelCase` (like `itemId`) instead of Python's standard `snake_case` (`item_id`)?
 38: 
 39: These global behaviors are controlled via Pydantic's configuration system.
 40: 
 41: ## Introducing `ConfigDict` and `model_config`
 42: 
 43: Pydantic allows you to customize model behavior by adding a special class attribute called `model_config`. This attribute should be assigned a dictionary-like object called `ConfigDict`.
 44: 
 45: Think of `model_config = ConfigDict(...)` as the **master instruction sheet** or the **global settings panel** attached to your `BaseModel` blueprint. It provides overarching rules for how Pydantic should handle the model.
 46: 
 47: **`ConfigDict`:** A special dictionary (specifically, a `TypedDict`) provided by Pydantic where you specify configuration options using key-value pairs.
 48: **`model_config`:** The class attribute on your `BaseModel` where you assign your `ConfigDict`.
 49: 
 50: Let's add some configuration to our `Product` model:
 51: 
 52: ```python
 53: # Import ConfigDict
 54: from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict
 55: 
 56: class Product(BaseModel):
 57:     # Define model-wide settings here
 58:     model_config = ConfigDict(
 59:         frozen=True,             # Setting 1: Make instances immutable
 60:         extra='forbid',          # Setting 2: Forbid extra fields during input validation
 61:         validate_assignment=True # Setting 3: Re-validate fields when they are assigned a new value
 62:     )
 63: 
 64:     item_id: int
 65:     name: str
 66:     price: float | None = None
 67: 
 68: # --- How these settings affect behavior ---
 69: 
 70: # 1. Forbid Extra Fields ('extra=forbid')
 71: try:
 72:     # Input data has an extra 'color' field
 73:     product_data_extra = {'item_id': 123, 'name': 'Thingy', 'color': 'blue'}
 74:     Product(**product_data_extra)
 75: except Exception as e:
 76:     print(f"Error on extra field:\n{e}")
 77:     # Expected Output (simplified):
 78:     # Error on extra field:
 79:     # 1 validation error for Product
 80:     # color
 81:     #   Extra inputs are not permitted [type=extra_forbidden, ...]
 82: 
 83: # 2. Immutability ('frozen=True')
 84: product = Product(item_id=456, name="Gadget")
 85: print(f"Initial product: {product}")
 86: # Expected Output: Initial product: item_id=456 name='Gadget' price=None
 87: 
 88: try:
 89:     # Attempt to change a field on the frozen instance
 90:     product.name = "New Gadget"
 91: except Exception as e:
 92:     print(f"\nError on assignment to frozen model:\n{e}")
 93:     # Expected Output (simplified):
 94:     # Error on assignment to frozen model:
 95:     # 1 validation error for Product
 96:     # name
 97:     #   Instance is frozen [type=frozen_instance, ...]
 98: 
 99: # 3. Validate Assignment ('validate_assignment=True')
100: product_mutable = Product.model_construct(item_id=789, name="Widget") # Use model_construct to bypass initial __init__ validation for demo
101: try:
102:     # Attempt to assign an invalid type (int instead of str)
103:     product_mutable.name = 999
104: except Exception as e:
105:     print(f"\nError on invalid assignment:\n{e}")
106:     # Expected Output (simplified):
107:     # Error on invalid assignment:
108:     # 1 validation error for Product
109:     # name
110:     #  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=999, input_type=int]
111: ```
112: 
113: By adding the `model_config` dictionary, we changed the fundamental behavior of our `Product` model without altering the field definitions themselves.
114: 
115: ## Common Configuration Options
116: 
117: Here are a few more useful options you can set in `ConfigDict`:
118: 
119: *   **`alias_generator`**: Automatically generate aliases for fields. Often used to convert between `snake_case` and `camelCase`.
120:     ```python
121:     from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict
122:     from pydantic.alias_generators import to_camel # Import a helper
123: 
124:     class User(BaseModel):
125:         user_id: int
126:         first_name: str
127: 
128:         model_config = ConfigDict(
129:             alias_generator=to_camel, # Use the camelCase generator
130:             populate_by_name=True # Allow using EITHER alias or python name for input (see warning below)
131:                                   # Replaced by validate_by_name=True + validate_by_alias=True
132:         )
133: 
134:     # Input using camelCase aliases
135:     user_data_camel = {'userId': 1, 'firstName': 'Arthur'}
136:     user = User(**user_data_camel)
137:     print(f"User created from camelCase: {user}")
138:     # Expected Output: User created from camelCase: user_id=1 first_name='Arthur'
139: 
140:     # Output (dumping) using aliases requires `by_alias=True`
141:     print(f"Dumped with aliases: {user.model_dump(by_alias=True)}")
142:     # Expected Output: Dumped with aliases: {'userId': 1, 'firstName': 'Arthur'}
143: 
144:     print(f"Dumped without aliases: {user.model_dump()}")
145:     # Expected Output: Dumped without aliases: {'user_id': 1, 'first_name': 'Arthur'}
146:     ```
147:     *   **Modern Alias Control (Pydantic >= v2.11):** Instead of `populate_by_name`, use `validate_by_alias`, `validate_by_name`, and `serialize_by_alias` for finer control:
148:         ```python
149:         from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict
150:         from pydantic.alias_generators import to_camel
151: 
152:         class UserV2(BaseModel):
153:             user_id: int
154:             first_name: str
155: 
156:             model_config = ConfigDict(
157:                 alias_generator=to_camel,
158:                 validate_by_name=True,     # Allow input using 'user_id', 'first_name'
159:                 validate_by_alias=True,    # Allow input using 'userId', 'firstName' (default is True)
160:                 serialize_by_alias=True    # Use aliases ('userId', 'firstName') when dumping by default
161:             )
162: 
163:         user_data_camel = {'userId': 1, 'firstName': 'Zaphod'}
164:         user_camel = UserV2(**user_data_camel)
165:         print(f"User from camel: {user_camel}")
166:         # > User from camel: user_id=1 first_name='Zaphod'
167: 
168:         user_data_snake = {'user_id': 2, 'first_name': 'Ford'}
169:         user_snake = UserV2(**user_data_snake)
170:         print(f"User from snake: {user_snake}")
171:         # > User from snake: user_id=2 first_name='Ford'
172: 
173:         # serialize_by_alias=True means model_dump() uses aliases by default
174:         print(f"Dumped (default alias): {user_camel.model_dump()}")
175:         # > Dumped (default alias): {'userId': 1, 'firstName': 'Zaphod'}
176:         print(f"Dumped (force no alias): {user_camel.model_dump(by_alias=False)}")
177:         # > Dumped (force no alias): {'user_id': 1, 'first_name': 'Zaphod'}
178:         ```
179: 
180: *   **`use_enum_values`**: When serializing (e.g., with `model_dump`), use the *value* of an enum member instead of the member itself.
181:     ```python
182:     from enum import Enum
183:     from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict
184: 
185:     class Status(Enum):
186:         PENDING = "pending"
187:         PROCESSING = "processing"
188:         COMPLETE = "complete"
189:

206: 
207: *   **`str_strip_whitespace` / `str_to_lower` / `str_to_upper`**: Automatically clean string inputs.

213:         author: str
214: 
215:         model_config = ConfigDict(
216:             str_strip_whitespace=True, # Remove leading/trailing whitespace
217:             str_to_lower=True          # Convert to lowercase
218:         )

221:     comment = Comment(**comment_data)
222:     print(comment)
223:     # Expected Output: text='hello world!' author='alice'
224:     ```
225: 
226: You can find the full list of configuration options in the Pydantic documentation for [`ConfigDict`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/config/#pydantic.config.ConfigDict).
227: 
228: **Important Note:** Configuration set in `model_config` generally applies *during validation and serialization*. For example, `alias_generator` helps Pydantic understand incoming data with aliases and optionally use aliases when producing output, but the internal attribute name in your Python code remains the Python name (e.g., `user_id`).
229: 
230: ## What About `ConfigWrapper`? (Internal Detail)
231: 
232: You might see `ConfigWrapper` mentioned in Pydantic's internal code or documentation.
233: 
234: **Analogy:** If `ConfigDict` is the settings form you fill out (`frozen=True`, `extra='forbid'`), then `ConfigWrapper` is the internal manager object that Pydantic creates *from* your form. This manager holds onto your settings, knows the default values for settings you *didn't* specify, and provides a consistent way for the rest of Pydantic (like the schema builder) to ask "Is this model frozen?" or "What should happen with extra fields?".
235: 
236: **Key Point:** As a user writing Pydantic models, you almost always interact with **`ConfigDict`** via the `model_config` attribute. You generally don't need to create or use `ConfigWrapper` directly. It's an internal helper that makes Pydantic's life easier.
237: 
238: ## Under the Hood: How Configuration is Applied
239: 
240: Let's refine our understanding of how a `BaseModel` class gets created, now including configuration.
241: 
242: **High-Level Steps:**
243: 
244: When Python creates your `Product` class:
245: 
246: 1.  **Inspection:** Pydantic's `ModelMetaclass` inspects the class definition. It finds the fields (`item_id: int`, etc.) and also looks for the `model_config` attribute.
247: 2.  **Config Processing:** If `model_config` (a `ConfigDict`) is found, Pydantic uses it (along with config from any parent classes) to create an internal `ConfigWrapper` instance. This wrapper standardizes access to all config settings, applying defaults for any missing options.
248: 3.  **FieldInfo Creation:** It processes field definitions, potentially using `Field()` as discussed in [Chapter 2](02_fields__fieldinfo___field_function_.md), creating `FieldInfo` objects.
249: 4.  **Schema Generation:** Pydantic now uses *both* the `FieldInfo` objects *and* the settings from the `ConfigWrapper` to generate the detailed internal [Core Schema](05_core_schema___validation_serialization.md). For example, if the `ConfigWrapper` says `frozen=True`, this instruction is baked into the Core Schema.
250: 5.  **Validator/Serializer Creation:** Optimized validator and serializer functions are created based on this final Core Schema.
251: 
252: **Sequence Diagram:**
253: 
254: This diagram shows how `model_config` influences the process:
255: 
256: ```mermaid
257: sequenceDiagram
258:     participant Dev as Developer
259:     participant Py as Python
260:     participant Meta as ModelMetaclass

262:     participant Core as Pydantic Core Engine
263: 
264:     Dev->>Py: Define `class Product(BaseModel): model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True, extra='forbid') ...`
265:     Py->>Meta: Ask to create `Product` class
266:     Meta->>Meta: Find `model_config` dict in namespace
267:     Meta->>CfgWrap: Create `ConfigWrapper` using `model_config` (and defaults)
268:     CfgWrap-->>Meta: Return `ConfigWrapper(config_dict={'frozen': True, 'extra': 'forbid', ...other defaults...})`
269:     Meta->>Meta: Collect fields (`item_id`, `name`, `price`) and their FieldInfo
270:     Meta->>Core: Request Core Schema using FieldInfo AND ConfigWrapper settings (e.g., frozen, extra)
271:     Core-->>Meta: Provide Core Schema incorporating model-wide rules
272:     Meta->>Core: Request validator/serializer from Core Schema
273:     Core-->>Meta: Provide optimized validator/serializer reflecting config
274:     Meta-->>Py: Return fully prepared `Product` class
275:     Py-->>Dev: `Product` class is ready, respecting the config
276: ```
277: 
278: The `ConfigWrapper` acts as a bridge, translating the user-friendly `ConfigDict` into instructions the Core Engine understands when building the schema and validators.
279: 
280: **Code Location:**
281: 
282: *   `ConfigDict`: Defined in `pydantic/config.py`. It's essentially a `TypedDict` listing all valid configuration keys.
283: *   `ConfigWrapper`: Defined in `pydantic._internal._config.py`. Its `__init__` takes the config dictionary. The `ConfigWrapper.for_model` class method is used by the metaclass to gather configuration from base classes and the current class definition. Its `core_config` method translates the stored config into the format needed by `pydantic-core`.
284: *   `ModelMetaclass`: In `pydantic._internal._model_construction.py`, the `__new__` method calls `ConfigWrapper.for_model` and passes the resulting wrapper to `build_schema_generator` and ultimately `complete_model_class`, which coordinates schema and validator/serializer creation.
285: 
286: ```python
287: # Simplified view from pydantic/config.py
288: # ConfigDict is a TypedDict listing allowed keys and their types
289: class ConfigDict(TypedDict, total=False):
290:     frozen: bool
291:     extra: Literal['allow', 'ignore', 'forbid'] | None

327:          core_options = { ... }
328:          return core_schema.CoreConfig(**core_options)
329: 
330: # Simplified view from pydantic._internal._model_construction.py (ModelMetaclass.__new__)
331: def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace, **kwargs):
332:     # ... lots of setup ...
333: 
334:     # Step 1: Gather configuration
335:     config_wrapper = ConfigWrapper.for_model(bases, namespace, kwargs) # Merges config from bases, class def, kwargs
336: 
337:     # Step 2: Prepare schema generator using the config
338:     schema_generator = build_schema_generator(
339:         cls, # The class being built
340:         config_wrapper,
341:         # ... other args ...
342:     )
343: 
344:     # Step 3: Build core schema, validator, serializer (using schema_generator which uses config_wrapper)
345:     # core_schema = schema_generator.generate_schema(cls) # Simplified
346:     # validator = SchemaValidator(core_schema, config_wrapper.core_config()) # Simplified
347:     # serializer = SchemaSerializer(core_schema, config_wrapper.core_config()) # Simplified
348: 
349:     # ... attach schema, validator, serializer to the class ...
350:     cls = super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace, **kwargs)
351:     # cls.__pydantic_validator__ = validator
352:     # ...
353: 
354:     return cls
355: ```
356: 
357: This setup ensures that the model-wide rules defined in `model_config` are consistently applied during both validation (creating model instances) and serialization (dumping model instances).
358: 
359: ## Conclusion
360: 
361: You've learned how to configure the overall behavior of your `BaseModel` blueprints:
362: 
363: *   Use the `model_config` class attribute, assigning it a `ConfigDict`.
364: *   `ConfigDict` acts as the **master instruction sheet** or **settings panel** for the model.
365: *   Common settings include `frozen`, `extra`, `alias_generator`, `use_enum_values`, and string cleaning options.
366: *   Pydantic uses this configuration, often via the internal `ConfigWrapper`, to tailor the validation and serialization logic defined in the [Core Schema](05_core_schema___validation_serialization.md).
367: 
368: With `BaseModel`, `Field`, and `ConfigDict`, you have powerful tools to define the structure, field-specific details, and overall behavior of your data models.
369: 
370: But what if you need logic that goes beyond simple configuration? What if you need custom validation rules that depend on multiple fields, or complex transformations before or after validation/serialization? That's where Pydantic's decorators come in.

  8: # Chapter 4: Custom Logic (Decorators & Annotated Helpers)
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 3: Configuration (ConfigDict / ConfigWrapper)](03_configuration__configdict___configwrapper_.md), we learned how to set global rules for our data blueprints using `model_config`. But what if we need more specific, custom rules or transformations that go beyond simple settings?
 11: 
 12: Imagine you need rules like:
 13: *   "This username must not contain any spaces."
 14: *   "The `end_date` must always be later than the `start_date`."
 15: *   "When sending this data as JSON, format this specific date field as `YYYY-MM-DD`."
 16: *   "When validating, convert incoming usernames to lowercase automatically."
 17: 
 18: These require custom code logic. Pydantic provides flexible ways to inject this custom logic directly into the validation and serialization processes.
 19: 
 20: ## Why Custom Logic?
 21: 
 22: Standard type hints (`str`, `int`), [Fields](02_fields__fieldinfo___field_function_.md) (`Field(gt=0)`), and [Configuration](03_configuration__configdict___configwrapper_.md) (`ConfigDict(extra='forbid')`) cover many common cases. However, sometimes the rules are more complex or specific to your application's needs.
 23: 
 24: For example, checking if a password meets complexity requirements (length, uppercase, numbers, symbols) or ensuring consistency between multiple fields (`start_date < end_date`) requires writing your own Python functions.
 25: 
 26: Pydantic offers two main ways to add this custom logic:
 27: 1.  **Decorators:** Special markers (`@...`) you put above methods in your `BaseModel` class.
 28: 2.  **`Annotated` Helpers:** Using Python's `typing.Annotated` along with special Pydantic classes to attach logic directly to a type hint.
 29: 
 30: **Analogy:** Think of these as adding custom steps to the construction (validation) and reporting (serialization) process for your data blueprint.
 31: *   **Validators** are like adding extra *inspection checks* at different stages of construction (before basic checks, after basic checks, or wrapping the entire process).
 32: *   **Serializers** are like specifying custom *formatting rules* for the final report (converting your data back to simple types like dicts or JSON).
 33: 
 34: Let's explore these mechanisms.
 35: 
 36: ## Decorators: Adding Logic via Methods
 37: 
 38: Decorators are a standard Python feature. They are functions that modify or enhance other functions or methods. Pydantic uses decorators to let you designate specific methods in your `BaseModel` as custom validators or serializers.
 39: 
 40: ### `@field_validator`: Checking Individual Fields
 41: 
 42: The `@field_validator` decorator lets you add custom validation logic for one or more specific fields *after* Pydantic has performed its initial type checks and coercion.
 43: 
 44: **Use Case:** Let's ensure a `username` field doesn't contain spaces.
 45: 
 46: ```python
 47: from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator, ValidationError
 48: 
 49: class UserRegistration(BaseModel):
 50:     username: str
 51:     email: str
 52: 
 53:     # This method will be called automatically for the 'username' field
 54:     # AFTER Pydantic checks it's a string.
 55:     @field_validator('username')
 56:     @classmethod # Field validators should usually be class methods
 57:     def check_username_spaces(cls, v: str) -> str:
 58:         print(f"Checking username: '{v}'")
 59:         if ' ' in v:
 60:             # Raise a ValueError if the rule is broken
 61:             raise ValueError('Username cannot contain spaces')
 62:         # Return the valid value (can also modify it here if needed)
 63:         return v
 64: 
 65: # --- Try it out ---
 66: 
 67: # Valid username
 68: user_ok = UserRegistration(username='cool_cat123', email='cat@meow.com')
 69: print(f"Valid user created: {user_ok}")
 70: # Expected Output:
 71: # Checking username: 'cool_cat123'
 72: # Valid user created: username='cool_cat123' email='cat@meow.com'
 73: 
 74: # Invalid username
 75: try:
 76:     UserRegistration(username='cool cat 123', email='cat@meow.com')
 77: except ValidationError as e:
 78:     print(f"\nValidation Error:\n{e}")
 79:     # Expected Output (simplified):
 80:     # Checking username: 'cool cat 123'
 81:     # Validation Error:
 82:     # 1 validation error for UserRegistration
 83:     # username
 84:     #   Value error, Username cannot contain spaces [type=value_error, ...]
 85: ```
 86: 
 87: **Explanation:**
 88: 1.  We defined a `check_username_spaces` method inside our `UserRegistration` model.
 89: 2.  We decorated it with `@field_validator('username')`. This tells Pydantic: "After you validate `username` as a `str`, call this method with the value."
 90: 3.  The `@classmethod` decorator is typically used so the method receives the class (`cls`) as the first argument instead of an instance (`self`).
 91: 4.  Inside the method, `v` holds the value of the `username` field *after* Pydantic's basic `str` validation.
 92: 5.  We check our custom rule (`' ' in v`).
 93: 6.  If the rule is violated, we raise a `ValueError` (Pydantic catches this and wraps it in a `ValidationError`).
 94: 7.  If the value is okay, we **must return it**. You could also transform the value here (e.g., `return v.lower()`).
 95: 
 96: `@field_validator` has a `mode` argument (`'before'` or `'after'`, default is `'after'`). `'after'` (as shown) runs *after* Pydantic's internal validation for the field type. `'before'` runs *before*, giving you the raw input value.
 97: 
 98: ### `@model_validator`: Checking the Whole Model
 99: 
100: Sometimes, validation depends on multiple fields interacting. The `@model_validator` decorator lets you run logic that involves the entire model's data.
101: 
102: **Use Case:** Ensure `end_date` is after `start_date`.
103: 
104: ```python
105: from datetime import date
106: from pydantic import BaseModel, model_validator, ValidationError
107: from typing import Self # Used for type hint in Python 3.11+
108: 
109: class Trip(BaseModel):
110:     start_date: date
111:     end_date: date
112:     destination: str
113: 
114:     # This method runs AFTER the model fields are validated individually
115:     @model_validator(mode='after')
116:     def check_dates(self) -> Self: # Use 'Self' or 'Trip' as return hint
117:         print(f"Checking dates: start={self.start_date}, end={self.end_date}")
118:         if self.start_date >= self.end_date:
119:             raise ValueError('End date must be after start date')
120:         # Return the validated model instance
121:         return self
122: 
123: # --- Try it out ---
124: 
125: # Valid dates
126: trip_ok = Trip(start_date=date(2024, 7, 1), end_date=date(2024, 7, 10), destination='Beach')
127: print(f"Valid trip: {trip_ok}")
128: # Expected Output:
129: # Checking dates: start=2024-07-01, end=2024-07-10
130: # Valid trip: start_date=datetime.date(2024, 7, 1) end_date=datetime.date(2024, 7, 10) destination='Beach'
131: 
132: # Invalid dates
133: try:
134:     Trip(start_date=date(2024, 7, 10), end_date=date(2024, 7, 1), destination='Mountains')
135: except ValidationError as e:
136:     print(f"\nValidation Error:\n{e}")
137:     # Expected Output (simplified):
138:     # Checking dates: start=2024-07-10, end=2024-07-01
139:     # Validation Error:
140:     # 1 validation error for Trip
141:     #   Value error, End date must be after start date [type=value_error, ...]
142: ```
143: 
144: **Explanation:**
145: 1.  We defined a `check_dates` method.
146: 2.  We decorated it with `@model_validator(mode='after')`. This tells Pydantic: "After validating all individual fields and creating the model instance, call this method."
147: 3.  In `'after'` mode, the method receives `self` (the model instance). We can access all fields like `self.start_date`.
148: 4.  We perform our cross-field check.
149: 5.  If invalid, raise `ValueError`.
150: 6.  If valid, **must return `self`** (the model instance).
151: 
152: `@model_validator` also supports `mode='before'`, where the method runs *before* individual field validation. In `'before'` mode, the method receives the class (`cls`) and the raw input data (usually a dictionary) and must return the (potentially modified) data dictionary to be used for further validation.
153: 
154: ### `@field_serializer`: Customizing Field Output
155: 
156: This decorator lets you control how a specific field is converted (serialized) when you call methods like `model_dump()` or `model_dump_json()`.
157: 
158: **Use Case:** Serialize a `date` object as a simple `"YYYY-MM-DD"` string.
159: 
160: ```python
161: from datetime import date
162: from pydantic import BaseModel, field_serializer
163: 
164: class Event(BaseModel):
165:     name: str
166:     event_date: date
167: 
168:     # Customize serialization for the 'event_date' field
169:     @field_serializer('event_date')
170:     def serialize_date(self, dt: date) -> str:
171:         # Return the custom formatted string
172:         return dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
173: 
174: # --- Try it out ---
175: event = Event(name='Party', event_date=date(2024, 12, 25))
176: 
177: # Default dump (dictionary)
178: print(f"Model object: {event}")
179: # Expected Output: Model object: name='Party' event_date=datetime.date(2024, 12, 25)
180: 
181: dumped_dict = event.model_dump()
182: print(f"Dumped dict: {dumped_dict}")
183: # Expected Output: Dumped dict: {'name': 'Party', 'event_date': '2024-12-25'}
184: 
185: dumped_json = event.model_dump_json(indent=2)
186: print(f"Dumped JSON:\n{dumped_json}")
187: # Expected Output:
188: # Dumped JSON:
189: # {
190: #   "name": "Party",
191: #   "event_date": "2024-12-25"
192: # }
193: ```
194: 
195: **Explanation:**
196: 1.  We defined `serialize_date` and decorated it with `@field_serializer('event_date')`.
197: 2.  The method receives `self` (the instance) and `dt` (the value of the `event_date` field). You can also add an optional `info: SerializationInfo` argument for more context.
198: 3.  It returns the desired serialized format (a string in this case).
199: 4.  When `model_dump()` or `model_dump_json()` is called, Pydantic uses this method for the `event_date` field instead of its default date serialization.
200: 
201: ### `@model_serializer`: Customizing Model Output
202: 
203: This allows custom logic for serializing the entire model object.
204: 
205: **Use Case:** Add a calculated `duration_days` field during serialization.
206: 
207: ```python
208: from datetime import date, timedelta
209: from pydantic import BaseModel, model_serializer
210: from typing import Dict, Any
211: 
212: class Trip(BaseModel):
213:     start_date: date
214:     end_date: date
215:     destination: str
216: 
217:     # Customize the entire model's serialization
218:     @model_serializer
219:     def serialize_with_duration(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
220:         # Start with the default field values
221:         data = {'start_date': self.start_date, 'end_date': self.end_date, 'destination': self.destination}
222:         # Calculate and add the custom field
223:         duration = self.end_date - self.start_date
224:         data['duration_days'] = duration.days
225:         return data
226: 
227: # --- Try it out ---
228: trip = Trip(start_date=date(2024, 8, 1), end_date=date(2024, 8, 5), destination='Lake')
229: 
230: print(f"Model object: {trip}")
231: # Expected Output: Model object: start_date=datetime.date(2024, 8, 1) end_date=datetime.date(2024, 8, 5) destination='Lake'
232: 
233: dumped_dict = trip.model_dump()
234: print(f"Dumped dict: {dumped_dict}")
235: # Expected Output: Dumped dict: {'start_date': datetime.date(2024, 8, 1), 'end_date': datetime.date(2024, 8, 5), 'destination': 'Lake', 'duration_days': 4}
236: 
237: dumped_json = trip.model_dump_json(indent=2)
238: print(f"Dumped JSON:\n{dumped_json}")
239: # Expected Output:
240: # Dumped JSON:
241: # {
242: #   "start_date": "2024-08-01",
243: #   "end_date": "2024-08-05",
244: #   "destination": "Lake",
245: #   "duration_days": 4
246: # }
247: ```
248: 
249: **Explanation:**
250: 1.  We decorated `serialize_with_duration` with `@model_serializer`.
251: 2.  The default `mode='plain'` means this method *replaces* the standard model serialization. It receives `self`.
252: 3.  We manually construct the dictionary we want as output, adding our calculated `duration_days`.
253: 4.  This dictionary is used by `model_dump()` and `model_dump_json()`.
254: 
255: There's also a `mode='wrap'` for `@model_serializer` (and `@field_serializer`) which is more advanced. It gives you a `handler` function to call the *next* serialization step (either Pydantic's default or another wrapper), allowing you to modify the result *around* the standard logic.
256: 
257: ## `Annotated` Helpers: Attaching Logic to Type Hints
258: 
259: Python's `typing.Annotated` allows adding extra metadata to type hints. Pydantic leverages this to let you attach validation and serialization logic directly inline with your field definitions.
260: 
261: **Analogy:** Instead of separate instruction sheets (decorators), this is like putting specific instruction tags directly onto an item in the blueprint.
262: 
263: Common helpers include:
264: *   **Validators:** `BeforeValidator`, `AfterValidator`, `PlainValidator`, `WrapValidator`
265: *   **Serializers:** `PlainSerializer`, `WrapSerializer`
266: 
267: Let's see how `AfterValidator` compares to `@field_validator`.
268: 
269: **Use Case:** Ensure `username` has no spaces, using `Annotated`.
270: 
271: ```python
272: from typing import Annotated
273: from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ValidationError
274: # Import the helper
275: from pydantic.functional_validators import AfterValidator
276: 
277: # Define the validation function (can be outside the class)
278: def check_no_spaces(v: str) -> str:
279:     print(f"Checking username via Annotated: '{v}'")
280:     if ' ' in v:
281:         raise ValueError('Username cannot contain spaces')
282:     return v
283: 
284: class UserRegistrationAnnotated(BaseModel):
285:     # Attach the validator function directly to the type hint
286:     username: Annotated[str, AfterValidator(check_no_spaces)]
287:     email: str
288: 
289: # --- Try it out ---
290: 
291: # Valid username
292: user_ok = UserRegistrationAnnotated(username='another_cat', email='cat@meow.com')
293: print(f"Valid user: {user_ok}")
294: # Expected Output:
295: # Checking username via Annotated: 'another_cat'
296: # Valid user: username='another_cat' email='cat@meow.com'
297: 
298: # Invalid username
299: try:
300:     UserRegistrationAnnotated(username='another cat', email='cat@meow.com')
301: except ValidationError as e:
302:     print(f"\nValidation Error:\n{e}")
303:     # Expected Output (simplified):
304:     # Checking username via Annotated: 'another cat'
305:     # Validation Error:
306:     # 1 validation error for UserRegistrationAnnotated
307:     # username
308:     #   Value error, Username cannot contain spaces [type=value_error, ...]
309: ```
310: 
311: **Explanation:**
312: 1.  We import `Annotated` from `typing` and `AfterValidator` from Pydantic.
313: 2.  We define a standalone function `check_no_spaces` (it doesn't need to be a method).
314: 3.  In the model, we define `username` as `Annotated[str, AfterValidator(check_no_spaces)]`. This tells Pydantic: "The type is `str`, and after validating it as a string, apply the `check_no_spaces` function."
315: 4.  The behavior is identical to the `@field_validator` example, but the logic is attached differently.
316: 
317: Similarly, you can use `BeforeValidator` (runs before Pydantic's type validation) or `PlainSerializer` / `WrapSerializer` to attach serialization logic.
318: 
319: **Use Case:** Serialize `date` as `"YYYY-MM-DD"` using `Annotated` and `PlainSerializer`.
320: 
321: ```python
322: from datetime import date
323: from typing import Annotated
324: from pydantic import BaseModel
325: # Import the helper
326: from pydantic.functional_serializers import PlainSerializer
327: 
328: # Define the serializer function
329: def format_date_yyyymmdd(dt: date) -> str:
330:     return dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
331: 
332: class EventAnnotated(BaseModel):
333:     name: str
334:     # Attach the serializer function directly to the type hint
335:     event_date: Annotated[date, PlainSerializer(format_date_yyyymmdd)]
336: 
337: # --- Try it out ---
338: event = EventAnnotated(name='Conference', event_date=date(2024, 10, 15))
339: 
340: print(f"Model object: {event}")
341: # Expected Output: Model object: name='Conference' event_date=datetime.date(2024, 10, 15)
342: 
343: dumped_dict = event.model_dump()
344: print(f"Dumped dict: {dumped_dict}")
345: # Expected Output: Dumped dict: {'name': 'Conference', 'event_date': '2024-10-15'}
346: 
347: dumped_json = event.model_dump_json(indent=2)
348: print(f"Dumped JSON:\n{dumped_json}")
349: # Expected Output:
350: # Dumped JSON:
351: # {
352: #   "name": "Conference",
353: #   "event_date": "2024-10-15"
354: # }
355: ```
356: 
357: This achieves the same result as the `@field_serializer` example, but by attaching the logic via `Annotated`.
358: 
359: **Which to choose? Decorators vs. Annotated Helpers:**
360: *   **Decorators (`@field_validator`, etc.):** Keep logic tightly coupled with the model class definition. Good if the logic intrinsically belongs to the model or needs access to `cls` or `self`. Can feel more object-oriented.
361: *   **`Annotated` Helpers (`AfterValidator`, etc.):** Allow defining reusable validation/serialization functions outside the model. Good for applying the same logic across different models or fields. Can make type hints more verbose but keeps the model body cleaner.
362: 
363: ## Under the Hood: Wiring Up the Logic
364: 
365: How does Pydantic discover and apply this custom logic?
366: 
367: **Decorators:**
368: 1.  **Class Creation:** When Python creates your `BaseModel` class (like `UserRegistration`), Pydantic's `ModelMetaclass` scans the class attributes.
369: 2.  **Decorator Detection:** It finds methods decorated with Pydantic decorators (`@field_validator`, `@model_serializer`, etc.). It uses helper classes like `PydanticDescriptorProxy` (from `pydantic._internal._decorators`) to wrap these methods and store metadata about the decorator (like which fields it applies to, the mode, etc., using internal classes like `FieldValidatorDecoratorInfo`).
370: 3.  **Info Storage:** Information about all found decorators is collected and stored internally, often associated with the class (e.g., in a hidden `__pydantic_decorators__` attribute holding a `DecoratorInfos` object).
371: 4.  **Schema Integration:** When generating the [Core Schema](05_core_schema___validation_serialization.md) for the model, Pydantic consults this stored decorator information. It translates the decorator rules (e.g., "run `check_username_spaces` after validating `username`") into corresponding schema components (like `after_validator_function`). The core validation/serialization engine then uses this schema.

392: ```
393: 
394: **`Annotated` Helpers:**
395: 1.  **Field Processing:** During class creation, when Pydantic processes a field like `username: Annotated[str, AfterValidator(check_no_spaces)]`, it analyzes the `Annotated` metadata.
396: 2.  **Helper Recognition:** It recognizes Pydantic helper classes like `AfterValidator`. These helpers often implement a special method `__get_pydantic_core_schema__`.
397: 3.  **Schema Generation:** Pydantic's schema generation logic (often involving `GetCoreSchemaHandler` from `pydantic.annotated_handlers`) calls `AfterValidator.__get_pydantic_core_schema__`. This method tells the handler how to integrate the custom logic (`check_no_spaces`) into the [Core Schema](05_core_schema___validation_serialization.md) being built for the `username` field.
398: 4.  **Schema Integration:** The handler modifies the schema-in-progress to include the custom logic (e.g., adding an `after_validator_function` component pointing to `check_no_spaces`). The final schema used by the core engine contains this logic directly associated with the field.

426: 
427: **Code Location:**
428: *   Decorator logic (detection, storage, proxy): `pydantic._internal._decorators.py`
429: *   `Annotated` helper classes (`AfterValidator`, `PlainSerializer`, etc.): `pydantic.functional_validators.py`, `pydantic.functional_serializers.py`
430: *   Schema generation integrating these: Primarily involves internal schema builders calling `__get_pydantic_core_schema__` on annotated types/metadata, often orchestrated via `pydantic._internal._generate_schema.GenerateSchema`. The `GetCoreSchemaHandler` from `pydantic.annotated_handlers.py` is passed around to facilitate this.

492: 
493: Both decorators and `Annotated` helpers ultimately achieve the same goal: embedding custom Python functions into the Pydantic validation and serialization pipeline by modifying the underlying [Core Schema](05_core_schema___validation_serialization.md).
494: 
495: ## Conclusion
496: 
497: You've learned two powerful ways to add custom logic to your Pydantic models:
498: 
499: *   **Decorators** (`@field_validator`, `@model_validator`, `@field_serializer`, `@model_serializer`) allow you to designate methods within your model class for custom validation or serialization tasks, applying logic to specific fields or the entire model.
500: *   **`Annotated` Helpers** (`BeforeValidator`, `AfterValidator`, `PlainSerializer`, etc.) let you attach validation or serialization functions directly to a field's type hint using `typing.Annotated`, often promoting reusable logic functions.
501: 
502: These tools give you fine-grained control over how your data is processed, going beyond basic type checks and configuration. They are essential for handling real-world data validation and formatting complexities.
503: 
504: Understanding how these mechanisms work often involves looking at the internal representation Pydantic uses: the Core Schema. In the next chapter, we'll delve into what this schema looks like and how Pydantic uses it.

  8: # Chapter 5: Core Schema & Validation/Serialization
  9: 
 10: In the previous chapters, we've seen how to define data structures using [BaseModel](01_basemodel.md), customize fields with [Field()](02_fields__fieldinfo___field_function_.md), set model-wide behavior with [Configuration](03_configuration__configdict___configwrapper_.md), and even add [Custom Logic](04_custom_logic__decorators___annotated_helpers_.md) using decorators. You might be wondering: how does Pydantic take all these Python definitions and use them to perform such fast and reliable validation and serialization?
 11: 
 12: The secret lies in an internal representation called the **Core Schema** and a high-performance engine called `pydantic-core`. Let's peek under the hood!
 13: 
 14: ## Why Look Under the Hood?
 15: 
 16: Imagine you've designed a beautiful blueprint for a house (your Pydantic `BaseModel`). You've specified room sizes (type hints), special fixtures (`Field` constraints), and overall building codes (`ConfigDict`). You've even added custom inspection notes (decorators).
 17: 
 18: Now, how does the construction crew actually *build* the house and check everything rigorously? They don't just glance at the user-friendly blueprint. They work from a highly detailed **technical specification** derived from it. This spec leaves no room for ambiguity.
 19: 
 20: In Pydantic, the **`CoreSchema`** is that technical specification, and the **`pydantic-core`** engine (written in Rust) is the super-efficient construction crew that uses it. Understanding this helps explain:
 21: 
 22: *   **Speed:** Why Pydantic is so fast.
 23: *   **Consistency:** How validation and serialization rules are strictly enforced.
 24: *   **Power:** How complex requirements are translated into concrete instructions.
 25: 
 26: ## What is the Core Schema? The Technical Specification
 27: 
 28: When Pydantic processes your `BaseModel` definition (including type hints, `Field` calls, `ConfigDict`, decorators, etc.), it translates all that information into an internal data structure called the **Core Schema**.
 29: 
 30: Think of the Core Schema as:
 31: 
 32: 1.  **The Bridge:** It connects your user-friendly Python code to the high-performance Rust engine (`pydantic-core`).
 33: 2.  **The Detailed Plan:** It's a precise, language-agnostic description of your data structure and all associated rules. It's like a very detailed dictionary or JSON object.
 34: 3.  **The Single Source of Truth:** It captures *everything* needed for validation and serialization:
 35:     *   Field types (`str`, `int`, `datetime`, nested models, etc.)
 36:     *   Constraints (`min_length`, `gt`, `pattern`, etc. from `Field()`)
 37:     *   Aliases (`alias='userName'` from `Field()`)
 38:     *   Defaults (from `Field()` or `= default_value`)
 39:     *   Model-wide settings (`extra='forbid'`, `frozen=True` from `ConfigDict`)
 40:     *   Custom logic (references to your `@field_validator`, `@field_serializer` functions, etc.)
 41: 
 42: **Analogy:** Your Python `BaseModel` is the architect's blueprint. The `CoreSchema` is the exhaustive technical specification document derived from that blueprint, detailing every material, dimension, and construction step.
 43: 
 44: ### A Glimpse of the Schema (Conceptual)
 45: 
 46: You don't normally interact with the Core Schema directly, but let's imagine what a simplified piece might look like for a field `name: str = Field(min_length=3)`.
 47: 
 48: ```python
 49: # Conceptual representation - the actual structure is more complex!
 50: name_field_schema = {
 51:   'type': 'str',          # The basic type expected
 52:   'min_length': 3,        # Constraint from Field(min_length=3)
 53:   'strict': False,        # Default strictness mode from config
 54:   'strip_whitespace': None # Default string handling from config
 55:   # ... other settings relevant to strings
 56: }
 57: 
 58: # A schema for a whole model wraps field schemas:
 59: model_schema = {
 60:     'type': 'model',
 61:     'cls': YourModelClass, # Reference to the Python class
 62:     'schema': {
 63:         'type': 'model-fields',
 64:         'fields': {
 65:             'name': { 'type': 'model-field', 'schema': name_field_schema },
 66:             # ... schema for other fields ...
 67:         },
 68:         # ... details about custom model validators ...
 69:     },
 70:     'config': { # Merged config settings
 71:         'title': 'YourModelClass',
 72:         'extra_behavior': 'ignore',
 73:         'frozen': False,
 74:         # ...
 75:     },
 76:     # ... details about custom serializers ...
 77: }
 78: ```
 79: 
 80: This internal schema precisely defines what `pydantic-core` needs to know to handle the `name` field and the overall model during validation and serialization.
 81: 
 82: **Inspecting the Real Schema:**
 83: 
 84: Pydantic actually stores this generated schema on your model class. You can (carefully) inspect it:
 85: 
 86: ```python
 87: from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
 88: 
 89: class User(BaseModel):
 90:     id: int
 91:     username: str = Field(min_length=5, alias='userName')
 92: 
 93: # Access the generated core schema
 94: # Warning: Internal structure, subject to change!
 95: print(User.__pydantic_core_schema__)
 96: # Output will be a complex dictionary representing the detailed schema
 97: # (Output is large and complex, not shown here for brevity)
 98: ```
 99: 
100: While you *can* look at `__pydantic_core_schema__`, treat it as an internal implementation detail. Its exact structure might change between Pydantic versions.
101: 
102: ## What is `pydantic-core`? The Efficient Construction Crew
103: 
104: `pydantic-core` is the heart of Pydantic's performance. It's a separate library, written in Rust (a language known for speed and safety), that does the heavy lifting of validation and serialization.
105: 
106: **How it Works:**
107: 
108: 1.  **Input:** When your `BaseModel` class is first defined, Pydantic generates the `CoreSchema` (as described above).
109: 2.  **Compilation:** This `CoreSchema` is passed to the `pydantic-core` engine. The engine takes this schema and *compiles* it into highly optimized, specialized validator and serializer functions *specifically for your model*. Think of this as the crew studying the spec and preparing the exact tools needed for *this specific house*.
110: 3.  **Storage:** These compiled Rust objects are attached to your Python model class, typically as `__pydantic_validator__` and `__pydantic_serializer__`.
111: 
112: ```python
113: # You can access these too (again, internal details!)
114: print(User.__pydantic_validator__)
115: # Output: <SchemaValidator 'User' ...> (a pydantic-core object)
116: 
117: print(User.__pydantic_serializer__)
118: # Output: <SchemaSerializer 'User' ...> (a pydantic-core object)
119: ```
120: 
121: This "compilation" step happens only *once* when the class is created. This makes subsequent validation and serialization extremely fast.
122: 
123: ## Validation Flow: Checking Incoming Materials
124: 
125: When you create an instance of your model or validate data:
126: 
127: ```python
128: # Example: Validation
129: try:
130:     user_data = {'id': 1, 'userName': 'validUser'}
131:     user = User(**user_data) # Calls __init__ -> pydantic validation
132:     # or: user = User.model_validate(user_data)
133: except ValidationError as e:
134:     print(e)
135: ```
136: 
137: Here's what happens behind the scenes:
138: 
139: 1.  **Call:** Your Python code triggers validation (e.g., via `__init__` or `model_validate`).
140: 2.  **Delegate:** Pydantic passes the input data (`user_data`) to the pre-compiled `User.__pydantic_validator__` (the Rust object).
141: 3.  **Execute:** The `pydantic-core` validator executes its optimized Rust code, guided by the rules baked in from the `CoreSchema`. It checks:
142:     *   Types (is `id` an `int`? is `userName` a `str`?)
143:     *   Coercion (can `'1'` be turned into `1` for `id`?)
144:     *   Constraints (is `len('validUser') >= 5`?)
145:     *   Aliases (use `userName` from input for the `username` field)
146:     *   Required fields (is `id` present?)
147:     *   Extra fields (handle according to `model_config['extra']`)
148:     *   Custom validators (`@field_validator`, etc. are called back into Python if needed, though core logic is Rust)
149: 4.  **Result:**
150:     *   If all checks pass, the validator returns the validated data, which Pydantic uses to create/populate the `User` instance.
151:     *   If any check fails, the Rust validator gathers detailed error information and raises a `pydantic_core.ValidationError`, which Pydantic surfaces to your Python code.
152: 
153: **Analogy:** The construction crew takes the delivery of materials (`user_data`) and uses the technical spec (`CoreSchema` baked into the validator) to rigorously check if everything is correct (right type, right size, etc.). If not, they issue a detailed non-compliance report (`ValidationError`).
154: 
155: ## Serialization Flow: Generating Reports
156: 
157: When you dump your model instance:
158: 
159: ```python
160: # Example: Serialization
161: user = User(id=1, username='validUser')
162: user_dict = user.model_dump()
163: # or: user_json = user.model_dump_json()
164: ```
165: 
166: Here's the flow:
167: 
168: 1.  **Call:** Your Python code calls `model_dump()` or `model_dump_json()`.
169: 2.  **Delegate:** Pydantic passes the model instance (`user`) to the pre-compiled `User.__pydantic_serializer__` (the Rust object).
170: 3.  **Execute:** The `pydantic-core` serializer executes its optimized Rust code, again guided by the `CoreSchema`. It:
171:     *   Iterates through the fields specified by the schema.
172:     *   Applies serialization rules (e.g., use aliases if `by_alias=True`).
173:     *   Handles `include`, `exclude`, `exclude_unset`, `exclude_defaults`, `exclude_none` logic efficiently.
174:     *   Formats values for the target output (Python objects for `model_dump`, JSON types for `model_dump_json`).
175:     *   Calls custom serializers (`@field_serializer`, etc.) back into Python if needed.
176: 4.  **Result:** The serializer returns the final dictionary or JSON string.
177: 
178: **Analogy:** The crew uses the technical spec (`CoreSchema` baked into the serializer) to generate a standardized report (`dict` or JSON) about the constructed house (`model instance`), formatting details (like using aliases) as requested.
179: 
180: ## Under the Hood: The Assembly Line
181: 
182: Let's visualize the entire process from defining a class to using it.
183: 
184: **Step-by-Step:**
185: 
186: 1.  **Definition:** You define your `class User(BaseModel): ...` in Python.
187: 2.  **Metaclass Magic:** When Python creates the `User` class, Pydantic's `ModelMetaclass` intercepts.
188: 3.  **Inspection:** The metaclass inspects the class definition: fields, type hints, `Field()` calls, `model_config`, decorators.
189: 4.  **Schema Generation (Python):** This information is fed into Pydantic's Python-based schema generation logic (`pydantic._internal._generate_schema`).
190: 5.  **CoreSchema Creation:** The generator produces the detailed `CoreSchema` data structure.
191: 6.  **Hand-off to Rust:** This `CoreSchema` is passed to the `pydantic-core` Rust library.
192: 7.  **Compilation (Rust):** `pydantic-core` creates optimized `SchemaValidator` and `SchemaSerializer` instances based *specifically* on that schema.
193: 8.  **Attachment:** These Rust-backed objects are attached to the `User` class as `__pydantic_validator__` and `__pydantic_serializer__`.
194: 9.  **Ready:** The `User` class is now fully prepared.
195: 10. **Usage (Validation):** Calling `User(...)` uses `User.__pydantic_validator__` (Rust) to process input.
196: 11. **Usage (Serialization):** Calling `user.model_dump()` uses `User.__pydantic_serializer__` (Rust) to generate output.

233: 
234: **Code Location:**
235: 
236: *   **Metaclass & Orchestration:** `pydantic._internal._model_construction.py` (handles class creation)
237: *   **Schema Generation (Python side):** `pydantic._internal._generate_schema.py` (builds the schema structure)
238: *   **Core Engine:** The `pydantic-core` library (Rust code, compiled). You interact with it via the `SchemaValidator` and `SchemaSerializer` objects attached to your models.
239: *   **Schema Representation:** The `CoreSchema` itself is defined using types from `pydantic_core.core_schema`.
240: 
241: ## Conclusion
242: 
243: You've now seen the engine behind Pydantic's power!
244: 
245: *   Pydantic translates your Python model definitions (`BaseModel`, `Field`, `ConfigDict`, decorators) into a detailed, internal **`CoreSchema`**.
246: *   This `CoreSchema` acts as the **technical specification** for your data.
247: *   The high-performance **`pydantic-core`** engine (written in Rust) takes this schema and "compiles" it into optimized `SchemaValidator` and `SchemaSerializer` objects.
248: *   These specialized objects perform fast **validation** (checking input) and **serialization** (dumping output) according to the rules defined in the schema.
249: 
250: This combination of a clear Python API and a powerful Rust core allows Pydantic to be both user-friendly and incredibly performant.
251: 
252: What if you want to leverage this powerful validation and serialization engine for types that *aren't* full `BaseModel` classes? Maybe just validate a standalone `list[int]` or serialize a `datetime` object according to specific rules? That's where `TypeAdapter` comes in handy.

  8: # Chapter 6: TypeAdapter - Your Universal Data Handler
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the final chapter of our Pydantic Core tutorial! In [Chapter 5: Core Schema & Validation/Serialization](05_core_schema___validation_serialization.md), we dove deep into how Pydantic uses the `CoreSchema` and the `pydantic-core` engine to efficiently validate and serialize data for your `BaseModel` classes.
 11: 
 12: But what if you have data that *isn't* structured as a `BaseModel`? Imagine you receive a simple list of product IDs from an API, or you need to validate a function argument that's just a dictionary or a date. You still want Pydantic's powerful validation and maybe its smart serialization, but creating a whole `BaseModel` just for `list[int]` seems like overkill.
 13: 
 14: This is exactly where `TypeAdapter` comes in!
 15: 
 16: ## The Problem: Handling Simple Types
 17: 
 18: Let's say you're working with a function that expects a list of user IDs, which should all be positive integers:
 19: 
 20: ```python
 21: # Our expected data structure: a list of positive integers
 22: # Example: [101, 205, 300]
 23: 
 24: # Incoming data might be messy:
 25: raw_data_ok = '[101, "205", 300]' # Comes as JSON string, contains string number
 26: raw_data_bad = '[101, -5, "abc"]' # Contains negative number and non-number string
 27: 
 28: def process_user_ids(user_ids: list[int]):
 29:     # How do we easily validate 'raw_data' conforms to list[int]
 30:     # AND ensure all IDs are positive *before* this function runs?
 31:     # And how do we handle the string "205"?
 32:     for user_id in user_ids:
 33:         print(f"Processing user ID: {user_id}")
 34:         # We assume user_ids is already clean list[int] here
 35: ```
 36: 
 37: Manually parsing the JSON, checking the type of the list and its elements, converting strings like `"205"` to integers, and validating positivity can be tedious and error-prone. We want Pydantic's magic for this simple list!
 38: 
 39: ## Introducing `TypeAdapter`: The Universal Handler
 40: 
 41: `TypeAdapter` provides Pydantic's validation and serialization capabilities for **arbitrary Python types**, not just `BaseModel` subclasses.
 42: 
 43: **Analogy:** Think of `TypeAdapter` as a **universal quality checker and packager**. Unlike `BaseModel` (which is like a specific blueprint for a complex object), `TypeAdapter` can handle *any* kind of item – a list, a dictionary, an integer, a date, a union type, etc. – as long as you tell it the **type specification** the item should conform to.
 44: 
 45: It acts as a lightweight wrapper around Pydantic's core validation and serialization engine for any type hint you give it.
 46: 
 47: ## Creating a `TypeAdapter`
 48: 
 49: You create a `TypeAdapter` by simply passing the Python type you want to handle to its initializer.
 50: 
 51: Let's create one for our `list[int]` requirement, but let's add the positivity constraint using `PositiveInt` from Pydantic's types.
 52: 
 53: ```python
 54: from typing import List
 55: from pydantic import TypeAdapter, PositiveInt
 56: 
 57: # Define the specific type we want to validate against
 58: # This can be any Python type hint Pydantic understands
 59: UserIdListType = List[PositiveInt]
 60: 
 61: # Create the adapter for this type
 62: user_id_list_adapter = TypeAdapter(UserIdListType)
 63: 
 64: print(user_id_list_adapter)
 65: # Expected Output: TypeAdapter(<class 'list[pydantic.types.PositiveInt]'>)
 66: ```
 67: 
 68: We now have `user_id_list_adapter`, an object specifically configured to validate data against the `List[PositiveInt]` type and serialize Python lists matching this type.
 69: 
 70: ## Validation with `TypeAdapter`
 71: 
 72: The primary use case is validation. `TypeAdapter` offers methods similar to `BaseModel`'s `model_validate` and `model_validate_json`.
 73: 
 74: ### `validate_python()`
 75: 
 76: This method takes a Python object (like a list or dict) and validates it against the adapter's type. It performs type checks, coercion (like converting `"205"` to `205`), and runs any defined constraints (like `PositiveInt`).
 77: 
 78: ```python
 79: from pydantic import ValidationError, PositiveInt, TypeAdapter
 80: from typing import List
 81: 
 82: UserIdListType = List[PositiveInt]
 83: user_id_list_adapter = TypeAdapter(UserIdListType)
 84: 
 85: # --- Example 1: Valid data (with coercion needed) ---
 86: python_data_ok = [101, "205", 300] # "205" needs converting to int
 87: 
 88: try:
 89:     validated_list = user_id_list_adapter.validate_python(python_data_ok)
 90:     print(f"Validation successful: {validated_list}")
 91:     # Expected Output: Validation successful: [101, 205, 300]
 92:     print(f"Types: {[type(x) for x in validated_list]}")
 93:     # Expected Output: Types: [<class 'int'>, <class 'int'>, <class 'int'>]
 94: except ValidationError as e:
 95:     print(f"Validation failed: {e}")
 96: 
 97: # --- Example 2: Invalid data (negative number) ---
 98: python_data_bad_value = [101, -5, 300] # -5 is not PositiveInt
 99: 
100: try:
101:     user_id_list_adapter.validate_python(python_data_bad_value)
102: except ValidationError as e:
103:     print(f"\nValidation failed as expected:\n{e}")
104:     # Expected Output (simplified):
105:     # Validation failed as expected:
106:     # 1 validation error for list[PositiveInt]
107:     # 1
108:     #   Input should be greater than 0 [type=greater_than, context={'gt': 0}, input_value=-5, input_type=int]
109: 
110: # --- Example 3: Invalid data (wrong type) ---
111: python_data_bad_type = [101, "abc", 300] # "abc" cannot be int
112: 
113: try:
114:     user_id_list_adapter.validate_python(python_data_bad_type)
115: except ValidationError as e:
116:     print(f"\nValidation failed as expected:\n{e}")
117:     # Expected Output (simplified):
118:     # Validation failed as expected:
119:     # 1 validation error for list[PositiveInt]
120:     # 1
121:     #   Input should be a valid integer, unable to parse string as an integer [type=int_parsing, input_value='abc', input_type=str]
122: ```
123: 
124: Just like with `BaseModel`, `TypeAdapter` gives you clear validation errors pinpointing the exact location and reason for the failure. It also handles useful type coercion automatically.
125: 
126: ### `validate_json()`
127: 
128: If your input data is a JSON string (or bytes/bytearray), you can use `validate_json()` to parse and validate in one step.
129: 
130: ```python
131: # Continuing from above...
132: 
133: # Input as a JSON string
134: raw_data_ok_json = '[101, "205", 300]'
135: raw_data_bad_json = '[101, -5, "abc"]'
136: 
137: # Validate the good JSON
138: try:
139:     validated_list_from_json = user_id_list_adapter.validate_json(raw_data_ok_json)
140:     print(f"\nValidated from JSON: {validated_list_from_json}")
141:     # Expected Output: Validated from JSON: [101, 205, 300]
142: except ValidationError as e:
143:     print(f"\nJSON validation failed: {e}")
144: 
145: # Validate the bad JSON
146: try:
147:     user_id_list_adapter.validate_json(raw_data_bad_json)
148: except ValidationError as e:
149:     print(f"\nJSON validation failed as expected:\n{e}")
150:     # Expected Output (simplified):
151:     # JSON validation failed as expected:
152:     # 1 validation error for list[PositiveInt]
153:     # 1
154:     #   Input should be greater than 0 [type=greater_than, context={'gt': 0}, input_value=-5, input_type=int]
155: ```
156: 
157: This is extremely handy for validating raw API request bodies or data loaded from JSON files without needing to parse the JSON yourself first.
158: 
159: ## Serialization with `TypeAdapter`
160: 
161: `TypeAdapter` can also serialize Python objects according to the rules of its associated type, similar to `BaseModel.model_dump()` and `model_dump_json()`.
162: 
163: ### `dump_python()`
164: 
165: Converts a Python object into a "dumped" representation (often simpler Python types). This is most useful when the type involves Pydantic models or types with custom serialization logic (like datetimes, enums, etc.). For simple types like `list[int]`, it might not change much.
166: 
167: Let's use a slightly more complex example: `List[datetime]`.
168: 
169: ```python
170: from datetime import datetime
171: from typing import List
172: from pydantic import TypeAdapter
173: 
174: datetime_list_adapter = TypeAdapter(List[datetime])
175: 
176: # A list of datetime objects
177: dt_list = [datetime(2023, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0), datetime(2024, 7, 15, 9, 30, 0)]
178: 
179: # Dump to Python objects (datetimes remain datetimes by default)
180: dumped_python = datetime_list_adapter.dump_python(dt_list)
181: print(f"Dumped Python: {dumped_python}")
182: # Expected Output: Dumped Python: [datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 1, 12, 0), datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 15, 9, 30)]
183: 
184: # To get JSON-compatible types (strings), use mode='json'
185: dumped_for_json = datetime_list_adapter.dump_python(dt_list, mode='json')
186: print(f"Dumped for JSON: {dumped_for_json}")
187: # Expected Output: Dumped for JSON: ['2023-01-01T12:00:00', '2024-07-15T09:30:00']
188: ```
189: 
190: ### `dump_json()`
191: 
192: Directly serializes the Python object into a JSON string, using Pydantic's encoders (e.g., converting `datetime` to ISO 8601 strings).
193: 
194: ```python
195: # Continuing with datetime_list_adapter and dt_list...
196: 
197: # Dump directly to a JSON string
198: dumped_json_str = datetime_list_adapter.dump_json(dt_list, indent=2)
199: print(f"\nDumped JSON:\n{dumped_json_str.decode()}") # .decode() to convert bytes to string for printing
200: # Expected Output:
201: # Dumped JSON:
202: # [
203: #   "2023-01-01T12:00:00",
204: #   "2024-07-15T09:30:00"
205: # ]
206: ```
207: 
208: This uses the same powerful serialization engine as `BaseModel`, ensuring consistent output formats.
209: 
210: ## Getting JSON Schema
211: 
212: You can also generate a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) for the type handled by the adapter using the `json_schema()` method.
213: 
214: ```python
215: # Using our user_id_list_adapter from before...
216: # UserIdListType = List[PositiveInt]
217: # user_id_list_adapter = TypeAdapter(UserIdListType)
218: 
219: schema = user_id_list_adapter.json_schema()
220: 
221: import json
222: print(f"\nJSON Schema:\n{json.dumps(schema, indent=2)}")
223: # Expected Output:
224: # JSON Schema:
225: # {
226: #   "items": {
227: #     "exclusiveMinimum": 0,
228: #     "type": "integer"
229: #   },
230: #   "title": "List[PositiveInt]",
231: #   "type": "array"
232: # }
233: ```
234: 
235: This schema accurately describes the expected data: an array (`"type": "array"`) where each item (`"items"`) must be an integer (`"type": "integer"`) that is greater than 0 (`"exclusiveMinimum": 0`).
236: 
237: ## Under the Hood: Direct Line to the Core
238: 
239: How does `TypeAdapter` work? It acts as a direct interface to the validation and serialization machinery we discussed in [Chapter 5](05_core_schema___validation_serialization.md).
240: 
241: **Step-by-Step:**
242: 
243: 1.  **Instantiation:** When you create `adapter = TypeAdapter(MyType)`, Pydantic immediately analyzes `MyType`.
244: 2.  **Schema Generation:** It generates the internal `CoreSchema` specifically for `MyType`, just like it would for a field within a `BaseModel`.
245: 3.  **Core Engine:** This `CoreSchema` is passed to the `pydantic-core` Rust engine.
246: 4.  **Compilation:** `pydantic-core` compiles and creates optimized `SchemaValidator` and `SchemaSerializer` objects based *only* on the `CoreSchema` for `MyType`.
247: 5.  **Storage:** These compiled validator and serializer objects are stored directly on the `TypeAdapter` instance (e.g., as `adapter.validator` and `adapter.serializer`).
248: 6.  **Usage:** When you call `adapter.validate_python(data)` or `adapter.dump_json(obj)`, the `TypeAdapter` simply delegates the call directly to its stored `SchemaValidator` or `SchemaSerializer`.
249: 
250: **Sequence Diagram:**

271:     Dev->>TA: adapter.validate_python(data)
272:     TA->>PydanticCore: Call self.validator.validate_python(data)
273:     PydanticCore-->>TA: Return validated data or raise ValidationError
274:     TA-->>Dev: Return result
275: 
276:     Dev->>TA: adapter.dump_json(obj)
277:     TA->>PydanticCore: Call self.serializer.to_json(obj)
278:     PydanticCore-->>TA: Return JSON bytes
279:     TA-->>Dev: Return result
280: ```
281: 
282: Unlike `BaseModel`, where the validator/serializer are attached to the *class*, with `TypeAdapter`, they are attached to the *instance* of the adapter. This makes `TypeAdapter` a neat, self-contained tool for handling specific types.
283: 
284: **Code Location:**
285: 
286: *   The main logic is in `pydantic/type_adapter.py`.
287: *   The `TypeAdapter.__init__` method orchestrates the process:
288:     *   It determines the correct Python namespaces for resolving type hints.
289:     *   It calls internal schema generation logic (`pydantic._internal._generate_schema.GenerateSchema`) to build the `CoreSchema` for the given type.
290:     *   It uses `pydantic_core.SchemaValidator(core_schema, config)` and `pydantic_core.SchemaSerializer(core_schema, config)` to create the core engine objects.
291:     *   These are stored on the instance as `self.validator` and `self.serializer`.
292: *   Methods like `validate_python`, `dump_json`, etc., are thin wrappers that call the corresponding methods on `self.validator` or `self.serializer`.

353:         return schema_generator_instance.generate(self.core_schema, mode=kwargs.get('mode', 'validation'))
354: 
355: ```
356: 
357: ## Conclusion
358: 
359: Congratulations! You've learned about `TypeAdapter`, a flexible tool for applying Pydantic's validation and serialization to any Python type, not just `BaseModel`s.
360: 
361: *   It's ideal for validating simple types, function arguments, or data structures where a full `BaseModel` isn't necessary.
362: *   You create it by passing the target type: `TypeAdapter(YourType)`.
363: *   It provides `.validate_python()`, `.validate_json()`, `.dump_python()`, `.dump_json()`, and `.json_schema()` methods.
364: *   It works by generating a `CoreSchema` for the target type and using dedicated `SchemaValidator` and `SchemaSerializer` instances from `pydantic-core`.
365: 
366: `TypeAdapter` completes our tour of the essential concepts in Pydantic V2. You've journeyed from the basic `BaseModel` blueprint, through customizing fields and configuration, adding custom logic, understanding the core schema engine, and finally, applying these powers universally with `TypeAdapter`.
367: 
368: We hope this tutorial has given you a solid foundation for using Pydantic effectively to build robust, reliable, and well-defined data interfaces in your Python applications. Happy coding!

It takes Python *type hints* and uses them to define how data should be structured and processed. Users typically interact with it by defining classes that inherit from `BaseModel`, which automatically gets validation and serialization capabilities based on its annotated fields. Pydantic Core ensures data conforms to the defined types and allows converting between Python objects and formats like JSON efficiently, leveraging Rust for performance.

  8: # Chapter 1: The Simplest Way - The Functional API
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the world of `Requests`! If you need to get information from a website or interact with a web service using Python, `Requests` is your friendly helper.
 11: 
 12: Imagine you just want to quickly grab the content of a webpage, maybe check the latest news headlines from a site, or send a simple piece of data to an online service. How do you do that without getting bogged down in complex details?
 13: 
 14: That's where the **Functional API** of `Requests` comes in. It's the most straightforward way to start making web requests.
 15: 
 16: ## What's the Functional API?
 17: 
 18: Think of the Functional API as a set of handy, ready-to-use tools right at the top level of the `requests` library. You don't need to set anything up; you just call a function like `requests.get()` to fetch data or `requests.post()` to send data.
 19: 
 20: **Analogy:** Ordering Takeout 🍕
 21: 
 22: Using the Functional API is like using a generic food delivery app (like DoorDash or Uber Eats) to order a pizza from a place you've never ordered from before.
 23: 
 24: 1.  You open the app ( `import requests`).
 25: 2.  You find the pizza place and tap "Order" (`requests.get('pizza_place_url')`).
 26: 3.  The app handles finding a driver, sending them to the restaurant, picking up the pizza, and delivering it to you (Requests does all the connection and fetching work).
 27: 4.  You get your pizza (`Response` object).
 28: 
 29: It's super convenient for a one-time order!
 30: 
 31: ## Making Your First Request: `requests.get()`
 32: 
 33: The most common type of request is a `GET` request. It's what your web browser does every time you type a website address and hit Enter. It means "Please *get* me the content of this page."
 34: 
 35: Let's try it! First, make sure you have `requests` installed (`pip install requests`). Then, in your Python script or interactive session:
 36: 
 37: ```python
 38: import requests # Import the library
 39: 
 40: # The URL we want to get data from
 41: url = 'https://httpbin.org/get' # A handy website for testing requests
 42: 
 43: # Use the functional API 'get' function
 44: print(f"Fetching data from: {url}")
 45: response = requests.get(url)
 46: 
 47: # Check if the request was successful (Status Code 200 means OK)
 48: print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
 49: 
 50: # Print the first 200 characters of the content we received
 51: print("Response Content (first 200 chars):")
 52: print(response.text[:200])
 53: ```
 54: 
 55: **What happened here?**
 56: 
 57: 1.  `import requests`: We told Python we want to use the `requests` library.
 58: 2.  `response = requests.get(url)`: This is the core magic! We called the `get` function directly from the `requests` module, passing the URL we want to visit.
 59: 3.  `requests` did all the work: connected to the server, sent the `GET` request, and received the server's reply.
 60: 4.  The reply is stored in the `response` variable. This isn't just the text of the page; it's a special `Response` object containing lots of useful information. We'll explore this more in [Request & Response Models](02_request___response_models.md).
 61: 5.  `response.status_code`: We checked the status code. `200` is the standard code for "Everything went okay!". Other codes might indicate errors (like `404 Not Found`).
 62: 6.  `response.text`: We accessed the main content (usually HTML or JSON) returned by the server as a string.
 63: 
 64: ## Sending Data: `requests.post()`
 65: 
 66: Sometimes, instead of just getting data, you need to *send* data to a website. This is often done when submitting a form, logging in, or telling an API to perform an action. The `POST` method is commonly used for this.
 67: 
 68: The Functional API provides `requests.post()` for this purpose.
 69: 
 70: ```python
 71: import requests
 72: 
 73: # The URL we want to send data to
 74: url = 'https://httpbin.org/post'
 75: 
 76: # The data we want to send (like form fields)
 77: # We'll use a Python dictionary
 78: payload = {'username': 'tutorial_user', 'action': 'learn_requests'}
 79: 
 80: print(f"Sending data to: {url}")
 81: # Use the functional API 'post' function, passing the data
 82: response = requests.post(url, data=payload)
 83: 
 84: # Check the status code
 85: print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
 86: 
 87: # The response often echoes back the data we sent
 88: print("Response Content:")
 89: print(response.text)
 90: ```
 91: 
 92: **What's new?**
 93: 
 94: 1.  `payload = {...}`: We created a Python dictionary to hold the data we want to send.
 95: 2.  `response = requests.post(url, data=payload)`: We called `requests.post()`. Notice the second argument, `data=payload`. This tells `requests` to send our dictionary as form data in the body of the `POST` request.
 96: 3.  The `response.text` from `httpbin.org/post` conveniently shows us the data it received, confirming our `payload` was sent correctly.
 97: 
 98: `Requests` also offers functions for other HTTP methods like `put`, `delete`, `head`, `patch`, and `options`, all working similarly: `requests.put(...)`, `requests.delete(...)`, etc.
 99: 
100: ## How It Works Under the Hood
101: 
102: You might wonder: if it's so simple, how does `requests.get()` actually connect to the internet and manage the request?
103: 
104: Every time you call one of these functional API methods (like `requests.get` or `requests.post`), `Requests` performs a few steps behind the scenes:
105: 
106: 1.  **Creates a temporary `Session` object:** Think of a `Session` as a more advanced way to manage requests, especially when you need to talk to the same website multiple times. We'll learn all about these in the [Session](03_session.md) chapter. For a functional API call, `requests` creates a *brand new, temporary* `Session` just for this single request.
107: 2.  **Uses the `Session`:** This temporary `Session` is then used to actually prepare and send your request (e.g., the `GET` to `https://httpbin.org/get`).
108: 3.  **Gets the `Response`:** The `Session` receives the reply from the server.
109: 4.  **Returns the `Response` to you:** The function gives you back the `Response` object.
110: 5.  **Discards the `Session`:** The temporary `Session` is immediately thrown away. It's gone.
111: 
112: **Analogy Revisited:** The generic delivery app (Functional API) contacts *a* driver (creates a temporary `Session`), tells them the restaurant and your order (sends the request), the driver delivers the food (returns the `Response`), and then the app forgets about that specific driver (discards the `Session`). If you order again 5 minutes later, it starts the whole process over with potentially a different driver.
113: 
114: Here's a simplified diagram of what happens when you call `requests.get()`:
115: 
116: ```mermaid
117: sequenceDiagram
118:     participant User as Your Code
119:     participant FuncAPI as requests.get()
120:     participant TempSession as Temporary Session
121:     participant Server as Web Server
122: 
123:     User->>FuncAPI: Call requests.get('url')
124:     FuncAPI->>TempSession: Create new Session()
125:     activate TempSession
126:     TempSession->>Server: Make HTTP GET request to 'url'
127:     activate Server
128:     Server-->>TempSession: Send HTTP Response back
129:     deactivate Server
130:     TempSession-->>FuncAPI: Return Response object
131:     FuncAPI-->>User: Return Response object
132:     deactivate TempSession
133:     Note right of FuncAPI: Temporary Session is discarded
134: ```
135: 
136: You can see a glimpse of this in the `requests/api.py` code:
137: 
138: ```python
139: # File: requests/api.py (Simplified view)
140: 
141: from . import sessions # Where the Session logic lives
142: 
143: def request(method, url, **kwargs):
144:     """Internal function that handles all functional API calls."""
145: 
146:     # Creates a temporary Session just for this one call.
147:     # The 'with' statement ensures it's properly closed afterwards.
148:     with sessions.Session() as session:
149:         # The temporary session makes the actual request.
150:         return session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)
151: 
152: def get(url, params=None, **kwargs):
153:     """Sends a GET request (functional API)."""
154:     # This is just a convenient shortcut that calls the main 'request' function.
155:     return request("get", url, params=params, **kwargs)
156: 
157: def post(url, data=None, json=None, **kwargs):
158:     """Sends a POST request (functional API)."""
159:     # Another shortcut calling the main 'request' function.
160:     return request("post", url, data=data, json=json, **kwargs)
161: 
162: # ... similar functions for put, delete, head, patch, options ...
163: ```
164: 
165: Each function like `get`, `post`, etc., is just a simple wrapper that calls the main `request` function, which in turn creates and uses that temporary `Session`.
166: 
167: ## When Is It Good? When Is It Not?
168: 
169: **Good For:**
170: 
171: *   Simple, one-off requests.
172: *   Quick scripts where performance isn't critical.
173: *   Learning `Requests` - it's the easiest starting point!
174: 
175: **Not Ideal For:**
176: 
177: *   **Multiple requests to the same website:** Creating and tearing down a connection and a `Session` for *every single request* is inefficient. It's like sending a separate delivery driver for each item you forgot from the grocery store.
178: *   **Needing persistence:** If the website gives you a cookie (like after logging in) and you want to use it on your *next* request to that same site, the functional API won't remember it because the temporary `Session` (which holds cookies) is discarded after each call.
179: *   **Fine-grained control:** If you need custom configurations, specific connection pooling, or advanced features, using a `Session` object directly offers more power.
180: 
181: ## Conclusion
182: 
183: You've learned about the `Requests` Functional API – the simplest way to make web requests using functions like `requests.get()` and `requests.post()`. It's perfect for quick tasks and getting started. You saw how it works by creating temporary `Session` objects behind the scenes.
184: 
185: While convenient for single shots, remember its limitations for performance and state persistence when dealing with multiple requests to the same site.

  8: # Chapter 2: What Happens When You Order? Request & Response Models
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1: The Simplest Way - The Functional API](01_functional_api.md), we saw how easy it is to fetch a webpage or send data using simple functions like `requests.get()` and `requests.post()`. We also noticed that these functions return something called a `Response` object.
 11: 
 12: But what exactly *is* that `Response` object? And what happens behind the scenes when `requests` sends your request? Just like ordering food involves more than just shouting your order and getting a meal, web requests have structured steps and data carriers. Understanding these helps you use `requests` more effectively.
 13: 
 14: ## Why Models? The Need for Structure
 15: 
 16: Imagine ordering takeout again. You don't just tell the restaurant "food!"; you give them specific details: "One large pepperoni pizza, delivery to 123 Main St." The restaurant then prepares exactly that and delivers it back to you with a receipt.
 17: 
 18: Web requests work similarly. You need to tell the server:
 19: *   *What* you want (the URL, like `/get` or `/post`).
 20: *   *How* you want to interact (the method, like `GET` or `POST`).
 21: *   *Any extra details* (like headers or data you're sending).
 22: 
 23: The server then replies with:
 24: *   *If it worked* (a status code, like `200 OK` or `404 Not Found`).
 25: *   *Information about the reply* (headers, like the content type).
 26: *   *The actual stuff* you asked for (the content, like HTML or JSON).
 27: 
 28: `Requests` uses special Python objects to hold all this information in an organized way. These are the **Request and Response Models**.
 29: 
 30: ## The Main Characters: Request, PreparedRequest, and Response
 31: 
 32: Think of the process like ordering at a restaurant:
 33: 
 34: 1.  **`Request` Object (Your Order Slip):** This is your initial intention. It holds the basic details of the request you *want* to make: the URL, the method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.), any headers you want to add, and any data you want to send. You usually don't create this object directly when using the simple functional API, but `requests` does it for you internally.
 35:     *   *Analogy:* You write down "Large Pizza, Pepperoni, Extra Cheese" on an order slip.
 36: 
 37: 2.  **`PreparedRequest` Object (The Prepared Tray):** This is the finalized, ready-to-go version of your request. `Requests` takes the initial `Request` object, processes it (encodes data, applies cookies, adds default headers like `User-Agent`), and gets it ready to be sent over the network. It contains the *exact* bytes and final details. This is mostly an internal step.
 38:     *   *Analogy:* The kitchen takes your slip, makes the pizza, puts it in a box, adds napkins and maybe a drink, and puts it all on a tray ready for the delivery driver.
 39: 
 40: 3.  **`Response` Object (The Delivered Meal):** This object represents the server's reply *after* the `PreparedRequest` has been sent and the server has responded. It contains everything the server sent back: the status code (Did the order succeed?), the response headers (What kind of food is this? How was it packaged?), and the actual content (The pizza itself!). This is the object you usually work with directly.
 41:     *   *Analogy:* The delivery driver hands you the tray with the pizza and receipt. You check the receipt (`status_code`, `headers`) and eat the pizza (`content`).
 42: 
 43: Most of the time, you'll interact primarily with the `Response` object. But knowing about `Request` and `PreparedRequest` helps understand what `requests` is doing for you.
 44: 
 45: ## Working with the `Response` Object
 46: 
 47: Let's revisit our `requests.get()` example from Chapter 1 and see what useful things are inside the `response` object we get back.
 48: 
 49: ```python
 50: import requests
 51: 
 52: url = 'https://httpbin.org/get'
 53: print(f"Fetching data from: {url}")
 54: response = requests.get(url)
 55: 
 56: # --- Exploring the Response Object ---
 57: 
 58: # 1. Status Code: Was it successful?
 59: print(f"\nStatus Code: {response.status_code}") # A number like 200 (OK) or 404 (Not Found)
 60: print(f"Was it successful (status < 400)? {response.ok}") # A boolean True/False
 61: 
 62: # 2. Response Headers: Information *about* the response
 63: print(f"\nResponse Headers (Content-Type): {response.headers['Content-Type']}")
 64: # Headers are like a dictionary (Case-Insensitive)
 65: print("All Headers:")
 66: for key, value in response.headers.items():
 67:     print(f"  {key}: {value}")
 68: 
 69: # 3. Response Content (Body): The actual data!
 70: #    - As text (decoded using guessed encoding):
 71: print("\nResponse Text (first 100 chars):")
 72: print(response.text[:100])
 73: 
 74: #    - As raw bytes (useful for non-text like images):
 75: print("\nResponse Content (bytes, first 20):")
 76: print(response.content[:20])
 77: 
 78: # 4. JSON Helper: If the content is JSON
 79: json_url = 'https://httpbin.org/json'
 80: print(f"\nFetching JSON from: {json_url}")
 81: json_response = requests.get(json_url)
 82: if json_response.ok and 'application/json' in json_response.headers.get('Content-Type', ''):
 83:     try:
 84:         data = json_response.json() # Decodes JSON into a Python dict/list
 85:         print("Decoded JSON data:")
 86:         print(data)
 87:         print(f"Value of 'title': {data['slideshow']['title']}")
 88:     except requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError:
 89:         print("Response was not valid JSON.")
 90: ```
 91: 
 92: **What we learned from the `Response`:**
 93: 
 94: 1.  **`response.status_code`**: A standard HTTP status code number. `200` means "OK". `404` means "Not Found". Many others exist.
 95: 2.  **`response.ok`**: A quick boolean check. `True` if the status code is less than 400 (meaning success or redirect), `False` for errors (4xx or 5xx codes).
 96: 3.  **`response.headers`**: A dictionary-like object holding the response headers sent by the server (like `Content-Type`, `Date`, `Server`). It's case-insensitive, so `response.headers['content-type']` works too.
 97: 4.  **`response.text`**: The response body decoded into a string. `Requests` tries to guess the correct text encoding based on headers, or falls back to a guess based on the content itself. Good for HTML, plain text, etc.
 98: 5.  **`response.content`**: The response body as raw bytes, exactly as received from the server. Use this for images, downloads, or when you need precise control over decoding.
 99: 6.  **`response.json()`**: A convenient method that tries to parse the `response.text` as JSON and returns a Python dictionary or list. It raises an error if the content isn't valid JSON.
100: 
101: The `Response` object neatly packages all the server's reply information for you to use.
102: 
103: ## How It Works Internally: From Request to Response
104: 
105: When you call `requests.get(url)`, the following happens under the hood (simplified):
106: 
107: 1.  **Create `Request`:** `Requests` creates a `Request` object containing the method (`'GET'`), the `url`, and any other arguments you provided (like `headers` or `params`). (See `requests/sessions.py` `request` method which creates a `models.Request`)
108: 2.  **Prepare `Request`:** This `Request` object is then passed to a preparation step. Here, it becomes a `PreparedRequest`. This involves:
109:     *   Merging session-level settings (like default headers or cookies from a [Session](03_session.md), which the functional API uses temporarily).
110:     *   Encoding parameters (`params`).
111:     *   Encoding the body (`data` or `json`).
112:     *   Handling authentication (`auth`).
113:     *   Adding standard headers (like `User-Agent`, `Accept-Encoding`).
114:     *   Resolving the final URL.
115:     (See `requests/sessions.py` `prepare_request` method which calls `PreparedRequest.prepare` in `requests/models.py`)
116: 3.  **Send `PreparedRequest`:** The `PreparedRequest`, now containing the exact bytes and headers, is handed off to a **Transport Adapter** (we'll cover these in [Transport Adapters](07_transport_adapters.md)). The adapter handles the actual network communication (opening connections, sending bytes, dealing with HTTP/HTTPS specifics). (See `requests/sessions.py` `send` method which calls `adapter.send` in `requests/adapters.py`)
117: 4.  **Receive Reply:** The Transport Adapter waits for the server's reply (status line, headers, body).
118: 5.  **Build `Response`:** The adapter takes the raw reply data and uses it to build the `Response` object you receive. It parses the status code, headers, and makes the raw content available. (See `requests/adapters.py` `build_response` method which creates a `models.Response`)
119: 6.  **Return `Response`:** The `send` method returns the fully formed `Response` object back to your code.
120:

222: 
223: Understanding these models gives you a clearer picture of how `requests` turns your simple function call into a network operation and packages the result neatly for you.
224: 
225: ## Conclusion
226: 
227: You've learned about the core data carriers in `Requests`:
228: *   `Request`: Your initial intent.
229: *   `PreparedRequest`: The finalized request ready for sending.
230: *   `Response`: The server's reply, containing status, headers, and content.
231: 
232: While you mostly interact with the `Response` object after making a request, knowing about the `Request` and `PreparedRequest` helps demystify the process. You saw how to access useful attributes of the `Response` like `status_code`, `headers`, `text`, `content`, and the handy `json()` method.
233: 
234: In Chapter 1, we noted that the functional API creates a temporary setup for each request. This is simple but inefficient if you need to talk to the same website multiple times, perhaps needing to maintain login status or custom settings. How can we do that better?

  8: # Chapter 3: Remembering Things - The Session Object
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 1](01_functional_api.md), we learned the easiest way to make web requests using functions like `requests.get()`. In [Chapter 2](02_request___response_models.md), we looked at the `Request` and `Response` objects that structure our communication with web servers.
 11: 
 12: We also saw that the simple functional API methods like `requests.get()` are great for single, one-off requests. But what if you need to talk to the *same website* multiple times? For example, maybe you need to:
 13: 
 14: 1.  Log in to a website (which gives you a "session cookie" to prove you're logged in).
 15: 2.  Make several requests to access different pages that *require* you to be logged in (using that cookie).
 16: 
 17: If you use `requests.get()` for each step, you'll have a problem. Remember how `requests.get()` creates a *temporary* setup for each call and then throws it away? This means it forgets the login cookie immediately after the login request! Your next request will be like visiting the site as a brand new, logged-out user.
 18: 
 19: How can we make `Requests` remember things between requests, just like your web browser does when you navigate around a logged-in site?
 20: 
 21: ## Meet the `Session` Object: Your Persistent Browser Tab
 22: 
 23: This is where the `requests.Session` object comes in!
 24: 
 25: Think of a `Session` object as a dedicated browser tab you've opened just for interacting with a specific website or web service. What does a browser tab do?
 26: 
 27: *   **Remembers Cookies:** If you log in on a website in one tab, that tab remembers your login cookie. When you click a link *within that same tab*, the browser automatically sends the cookie back, keeping you logged in.
 28: *   **Keeps Connections Warm:** Your browser often keeps the underlying network connection (TCP connection) to the website open for a little while. This makes clicking links and loading subsequent pages much faster because it doesn't have to establish a new connection every single time. This is called **connection pooling**.
 29: *   **Applies Consistent Settings:** You might have browser extensions that add specific headers to your requests, or your browser sends a consistent "User-Agent" string identifying itself.
 30: 
 31: A `requests.Session` object does all of these things for your Python script:
 32: 
 33: 1.  **Cookie Persistence:** It automatically stores cookies sent by the server and sends them back on subsequent requests to the same domain.
 34: 2.  **Connection Pooling:** It reuses the underlying TCP connections for requests to the same host, significantly speeding up multiple requests. This is managed by components called [Transport Adapters](07_transport_adapters.md).
 35: 3.  **Default Data:** You can set default headers, authentication details, query parameters, or proxy settings directly on the `Session` object, and they will be applied to all requests made through that session.
 36: 
 37: ## Using a `Session`
 38: 
 39: Using a `Session` is almost as easy as using the functional API. Instead of calling `requests.get()`, you first create a `Session` object, and then call methods like `get()` or `post()` on *that object*.
 40: 
 41: ```python
 42: import requests
 43: 
 44: # 1. Create a Session object
 45: s = requests.Session()
 46: 
 47: # Let's try accessing a page that requires a login (we're not logged in yet)
 48: login_required_url = 'https://httpbin.org/cookies' # This page shows cookies sent to it
 49: print("Trying to access protected page without login...")
 50: response1 = s.get(login_required_url)
 51: print("Cookies sent (should be none):", response1.json()) # httpbin returns JSON
 52: 
 53: # Now, let's simulate 'logging in' by visiting a page that sets a cookie
 54: cookie_setter_url = 'https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/sessioncookie/123456789'
 55: print("\nSimulating login by getting a cookie...")
 56: response2 = s.get(cookie_setter_url)
 57: # The session automatically stored the cookie! Check the session's cookie jar:
 58: print("Session cookies after setting:", s.cookies.get_dict())
 59: 
 60: # Now, try accessing the 'protected' page again using the SAME session
 61: print("\nTrying to access protected page AGAIN with the session...")
 62: response3 = s.get(login_required_url)
 63: print("Cookies sent (should have sessioncookie):", response3.json())
 64: 
 65: # Compare with using the functional API (which forgets cookies)
 66: print("\nTrying the same with functional API (will fail)...")
 67: response4 = requests.get(cookie_setter_url) # Gets cookie, but immediately forgets
 68: response5 = requests.get(login_required_url)
 69: print("Cookies sent via functional API (should be none):", response5.json())
 70: ```
 71: 
 72: **What happened here?**
 73: 
 74: 1.  `s = requests.Session()`: We created our "persistent browser tab".
 75: 2.  `response1 = s.get(login_required_url)`: Our first request sent no cookies, as expected.
 76: 3.  `response2 = s.get(cookie_setter_url)`: We visited a URL designed to send back a `Set-Cookie` header. The `Session` object automatically noticed this and stored the `sessioncookie` in its internal [Cookie Jar](04_cookie_jar.md).
 77: 4.  `s.cookies.get_dict()`: We peeked inside the session's cookie storage and saw the cookie was indeed saved.
 78: 5.  `response3 = s.get(login_required_url)`: We made *another* request using the *same* session `s`. This time, the session automatically included the `sessioncookie` in the request headers. The server received it!
 79: 6.  The last part shows that if we used `requests.get()` instead, the cookie from `response4` would be lost, and `response5` would fail to send it. The `Session` was crucial for remembering the cookie.
 80: 
 81: ## Persistent Settings: Headers, Auth, etc.
 82: 
 83: Besides cookies, you can set other things on the `Session` that will apply to all its requests.
 84: 
 85: ```python
 86: import requests
 87: import os # To get environment variables for auth example
 88: 
 89: s = requests.Session()
 90: 
 91: # Set a default header for all requests made by this session
 92: s.headers.update({'X-My-Custom-Header': 'HelloSession'})
 93: 
 94: # Set default authentication (using basic auth from environment variables for example)
 95: # NOTE: Replace with actual username/password or use httpbin's basic-auth endpoint
 96: # For httpbin, the user/pass is 'user'/'pass'
 97: # s.auth = ('user', 'passwd') # Set directly if needed
 98: httpbin_user = os.environ.get("HTTPBIN_USER", "testuser") # Fake user if not set
 99: httpbin_pass = os.environ.get("HTTPBIN_PASS", "testpass") # Fake pass if not set
100: s.auth = (httpbin_user, httpbin_pass)
101: 
102: # Set default query parameters
103: s.params.update({'session_param': 'persistent'})
104: 
105: # Now make a request
106: url = 'https://httpbin.org/get' # Changed endpoint to see params
107: print(f"Making request with persistent session settings to: {url}")
108: response = s.get(url)
109: 
110: print(f"\nStatus Code: {response.status_code}")
111: # Check the response (httpbin.org/get echoes back request details)
112: response_data = response.json()
113: print("\nHeaders sent (look for X-My-Custom-Header):")
114: print(response_data['headers'])
115: # print("\nAuth info sent (if using httpbin basic-auth):")
116: # print(response_data.get('authenticated'), response_data.get('user')) # Won't show here for /get
117: print("\nQuery parameters sent (look for session_param):")
118: print(response_data['args'])
119: 
120: # Make another request to a different endpoint using the same session
121: headers_url = 'https://httpbin.org/headers'
122: print(f"\nMaking request to {headers_url}...")
123: response_headers = s.get(headers_url)
124: print("Headers received by second request (still has custom header):")
125: print(response_headers.json()['headers'])
126: ```
127: 
128: **What we see:**
129: 
130: *   The `X-My-Custom-Header` we set on `s.headers` was automatically added to both requests.
131: *   The `session_param` we added to `s.params` was included in the query string of the first request.
132: *   If we had used a real authentication endpoint, the `s.auth` details would have been used automatically.
133: *   We didn't have to specify these details on each `s.get()` call! The `Session` handled it.
134: 
135: ## Using Sessions with `with` (Context Manager)
136: 
137: Sessions manage resources like network connections. It's good practice to explicitly close them when you're done. The easiest way to ensure this happens is to use the `Session` as a context manager with the `with` statement.
138: 
139: ```python
140: import requests
141: 
142: url = 'https://httpbin.org/cookies'
143: 
144: # Use the Session as a context manager
145: with requests.Session() as s:
146:     s.get('https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/contextcookie/abc')
147:     response = s.get(url)
148:     print("Cookies sent within 'with' block:", response.json())
149: 
150: # After the 'with' block, the session 's' is automatically closed.
151: # Making a request now might fail or use a new connection pool if s was reused (not recommended)
152: # print("\nTrying to use session after 'with' block (might not work as expected)...")
153: # try:
154: #    response_after = s.get(url)
155: #    print(response_after.text)
156: # except Exception as e:
157: #    print(f"Error using session after close: {e}")
158: 
159: print("\nSession automatically closed after 'with' block.")
160: ```
161: 
162: The `with` statement ensures that `s.close()` is called automatically at the end of the block, even if errors occur. This cleans up the underlying connections managed by the [Transport Adapters](07_transport_adapters.md).
163: 
164: ## How It Works Internally
165: 
166: So, how does the `Session` actually achieve this persistence and efficiency?
167: 
168: 1.  **State Storage:** The `Session` object itself holds onto configuration like `headers`, `cookies` (in a [Cookie Jar](04_cookie_jar.md)), `auth`, `params`, etc.
169: 2.  **Request Preparation:** When you call a method like `s.get(url, headers=...)`, the `Session` takes your request details *and* its own stored settings and merges them together. It uses these merged settings to create the `PreparedRequest` object we saw in [Chapter 2](02_request___response_models.md). Session cookies and headers get added automatically during this step (`Session.prepare_request`).
170: 3.  **Transport Adapters & Pooling:** The `Session` doesn't directly handle network sockets. It delegates the sending of the `PreparedRequest` to a suitable **Transport Adapter** (usually `HTTPAdapter` for HTTP/HTTPS). Each `Session` typically keeps instances of these adapters. The *adapter* is responsible for managing the pool of underlying network connections (`urllib3`'s connection pool). When you make a request to `https://example.com`, the adapter checks if it already has an open, reusable connection to that host in its pool. If yes, it uses it (much faster!). If not, it creates a new one and potentially adds it to the pool for future reuse.
171: 4.  **Response Processing:** When the adapter receives the response, it builds the `Response` object. The `Session` then gets the `Response` back from the adapter. Crucially, it inspects the response headers (like `Set-Cookie`) and updates its own state (e.g., adds new cookies to its `Cookie Jar`).
172: 
173: Here's a simplified diagram showing two requests using a `Session`:

317: 
318: The key takeaways are:
319: *   The `Session` object holds the state (`headers`, `cookies`, `auth`).
320: *   `prepare_request` merges this state with the details of the specific request you're making.
321: *   `send` uses a `Transport Adapter` (like `HTTPAdapter`) which handles the actual network communication and connection pooling.
322: *   After a response is received, `send` (and the redirection logic) updates the `Session`'s cookies.
323: 
324: ## Conclusion
325: 
326: You've learned about the `requests.Session` object, a powerful tool for making multiple requests to the same host efficiently. You saw how it automatically handles **cookie persistence** and provides significant performance benefits through **connection pooling** (via [Transport Adapters](07_transport_adapters.md)). You also learned how to set persistent `headers`, `auth`, and other settings on a session. Using a `Session` is the recommended approach when your script needs to interact with a website more than once.
327: 
328: We mentioned that the `Session` stores cookies in a "Cookie Jar". What exactly is that, and can we interact with it more directly? Let's find out.

  8: # Chapter 4: The Cookie Jar - Remembering Website Visits
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 3: Remembering Things - The Session Object](03_session.md), we saw how `Session` objects are super useful for making multiple requests to the same website. A big reason they work so well is that they automatically remember **cookies** sent by the server, just like your web browser does.
 11: 
 12: But *how* does a `Session` remember these cookies? Where does it keep them? Welcome to the **Cookie Jar**!
 13: 
 14: ## What's the Problem? Staying Logged In
 15: 
 16: Imagine you log in to a website. The website usually sends back a special piece of information called a **cookie**. This cookie is like a temporary ID card. When you visit other pages on that *same* website, your browser automatically shows this ID card (sends the cookie back) so the website knows you're still logged in.
 17: 
 18: If you used the simple `requests.get()` function from [Chapter 1](01_functional_api.md) for each step, it would forget the ID card immediately after logging in. Your next request would be treated as if you were a stranger.
 19: 
 20: `Session` objects solve this by using a **Cookie Jar** to hold onto those ID cards (cookies) for you.
 21: 
 22: ## What are Cookies (Briefly)?
 23: 
 24: Think of cookies as little notes or name tags that websites give to your browser (or your `requests` script).
 25: 
 26: *   **Website:** "Hi, you just logged in. Here's a name tag that says 'User123'." (Sends a `Set-Cookie` header)
 27: *   **Your Browser / Session:** "Okay, I'll keep this 'User123' tag." (Stores the cookie)
 28: *   **You:** (Click on another page on the same website)
 29: *   **Your Browser / Session:** "Hi website, I'd like this page. By the way, here's my name tag: 'User123'." (Sends a `Cookie` header)
 30: *   **Website:** "Ah, User123, I remember you. Here's the page you asked for."
 31: 
 32: Cookies are used to remember login status, user preferences, items in a shopping cart, etc., between different page visits.
 33: 
 34: ## The Cookie Jar Analogy 🍪
 35: 
 36: `Requests` uses an object called a `RequestsCookieJar` to store and manage cookies. It's very much like the cookie jar you might have in your kitchen:
 37: 
 38: 1.  **Collects Cookies:** When a website sends you a cookie (like after you log in), the `Session` automatically puts it into its `Cookie Jar`.
 39: 2.  **Stores Them Safely:** The jar keeps all the cookies collected from different websites (domains).
 40: 3.  **Sends the Right Ones Back:** When you make *another* request to a website using the *same* `Session`, the `Session` looks into the `Cookie Jar`, finds any cookies that belong to that website's domain, and automatically sends them back.
 41: 
 42: This happens seamlessly when you use a `Session` object.
 43: 
 44: ## Meet `RequestsCookieJar`
 45: 
 46: The specific object `requests` uses is `requests.cookies.RequestsCookieJar`. It's designed to work just like Python's standard `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` but adds some convenient features, like acting like a dictionary.
 47: 
 48: Every `Session` object has its own `Cookie Jar` accessible via the `s.cookies` attribute.
 49: 
 50: Let's see it in action, revisiting the example from Chapter 3:
 51: 
 52: ```python
 53: import requests
 54: 
 55: # Create a Session object (which has its own empty Cookie Jar)
 56: s = requests.Session()
 57: print(f"Initial session cookies: {s.cookies.get_dict()}")
 58: 
 59: # Visit a page that sets a cookie
 60: cookie_setter_url = 'https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/fruit/apple'
 61: print(f"\nVisiting {cookie_setter_url}...")
 62: response1 = s.get(cookie_setter_url)
 63: 
 64: # Check the Session's Cookie Jar - it should have the cookie now!
 65: print(f"Session cookies after setting: {s.cookies.get_dict()}")
 66: 
 67: # Visit another page on the same domain (httpbin.org)
 68: cookie_viewer_url = 'https://httpbin.org/cookies'
 69: print(f"\nVisiting {cookie_viewer_url}...")
 70: response2 = s.get(cookie_viewer_url)
 71: 
 72: # This page shows the cookies it received. Let's see if our 'fruit' cookie was sent.
 73: print("Cookies received by the server:")
 74: print(response2.text) # httpbin.org/cookies returns JSON showing received cookies
 75: ```
 76: 
 77: **Output:**
 78: 
 79: ```
 80: Initial session cookies: {}
 81: 
 82: Visiting https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/fruit/apple...
 83: Session cookies after setting: {'fruit': 'apple'}
 84: 
 85: Visiting https://httpbin.org/cookies...
 86: Cookies received by the server:
 87: {
 88:   "cookies": {
 89:     "fruit": "apple"
 90:   }
 91: }
 92: 
 93: ```
 94: 
 95: **Explanation:**
 96: 
 97: 1.  We started with an empty `Session` and an empty cookie jar (`{}`).
 98: 2.  We visited `/cookies/set/fruit/apple`. The server sent back a `Set-Cookie: fruit=apple; Path=/` header.
 99: 3.  The `Session` object `s` automatically saw this header and stored the `fruit=apple` cookie in its jar (`s.cookies`). We confirmed this by printing `s.cookies.get_dict()`.
100: 4.  We then visited `/cookies` using the *same session* `s`.
101: 5.  The `Session` automatically looked in `s.cookies`, found the `fruit` cookie (since it's for the `httpbin.org` domain), and added a `Cookie: fruit=apple` header to the request.
102: 6.  The server at `/cookies` received this header and echoed it back, confirming our cookie was sent!
103: 
104: The `Session` and its `Cookie Jar` handled the persistence automatically.
105: 
106: ## Cookies in the Response
107: 
108: While the `Session` cookie jar (`s.cookies`) holds *all* cookies collected during the session's lifetime, the [Request & Response Models](02_request___response_models.md) also have a `cookies` attribute.
109: 
110: The `response.cookies` attribute (also a `RequestsCookieJar`) contains *only* the cookies that were set or updated by *that specific response*. It doesn't know about cookies from previous responses in the session.
111: 
112: ```python
113: import requests
114: 
115: s = requests.Session()
116: 
117: url_set_a = 'https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/cookieA/valueA'
118: url_set_b = 'https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/cookieB/valueB'
119: 
120: print(f"Visiting {url_set_a}")
121: response_a = s.get(url_set_a)
122: print(f"Cookies SET by response A: {response_a.cookies.get_dict()}")
123: print(f"ALL session cookies after A: {s.cookies.get_dict()}")
124: 
125: print(f"\nVisiting {url_set_b}")
126: response_b = s.get(url_set_b)
127: print(f"Cookies SET by response B: {response_b.cookies.get_dict()}")
128: print(f"ALL session cookies after B: {s.cookies.get_dict()}")
129: ```
130: 
131: **Output:**
132: 
133: ```
134: Visiting https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/cookieA/valueA
135: Cookies SET by response A: {'cookieA': 'valueA'}
136: ALL session cookies after A: {'cookieA': 'valueA'}
137: 
138: Visiting https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/cookieB/valueB
139: Cookies SET by response B: {'cookieB': 'valueB'}
140: ALL session cookies after B: {'cookieA': 'valueA', 'cookieB': 'valueB'}
141: ```
142: 
143: **Explanation:**
144: 
145: *   `response_a.cookies` only contains `cookieA`, because that's the cookie set by *that specific response*.
146: *   `s.cookies` contains `cookieA` after the first request.
147: *   `response_b.cookies` only contains `cookieB`.
148: *   `s.cookies` contains *both* `cookieA` and `cookieB` after the second request, because the `Session` accumulates cookies.
149: 
150: ## Using the Cookie Jar Like a Dictionary
151: 
152: The `RequestsCookieJar` is extra friendly because you can treat it much like a Python dictionary to access or modify cookies directly.
153: 
154: ```python
155: import requests
156: 
157: jar = requests.cookies.RequestsCookieJar()
158: 
159: # Set cookies using dictionary-like assignment or set()
160: jar.set('username', 'Nate', domain='httpbin.org', path='/')
161: jar['session_id'] = 'abcdef123' # Sets for default domain/path ('')
162: 
163: print(f"Jar contents: {jar.get_dict()}")
164: 
165: # Get cookies using dictionary-like access or get()
166: print(f"Username: {jar['username']}")
167: print(f"Session ID: {jar.get('session_id')}")
168: print(f"API Key (default None): {jar.get('api_key', default='NoKey')}")
169: 
170: # Iterate over cookies
171: print("\nIterating:")
172: for name, value in jar.items():
173:     print(f" - {name}: {value}")
174: 
175: # Delete a cookie
176: del jar['session_id']
177: print(f"\nJar after deleting session_id: {jar.get_dict()}")
178: ```
179: 
180: **Output:**
181: 
182: ```
183: Jar contents: {'session_id': 'abcdef123', 'username': 'Nate'}
184: Username: Nate
185: Session ID: abcdef123
186: API Key (default None): NoKey
187: 
188: Iterating:
189:  - session_id: abcdef123
190:  - username: Nate
191: 
192: Jar after deleting session_id: {'username': 'Nate'}
193: ```
194: 
195: This makes it easy to manually inspect, add, or modify cookies if needed, although the `Session` usually handles the common cases automatically.
196: 
197: **Important Note:** Cookies often have specific `domain` and `path` attributes. If you have multiple cookies with the *same name* but for different domains or paths (e.g., `user=A` for `site1.com` and `user=B` for `site2.com`), using the simple dictionary access `jar['user']` might be ambiguous or raise an error. In such cases, use the `get()` or `set()` methods with the `domain` and `path` arguments for more precision:
198: 
199: ```python
200: jar.set('pref', 'dark', domain='example.com', path='/')
201: jar.set('pref', 'compact', domain='test.com', path='/')
202: 
203: # Get the specific cookie for example.com
204: pref_example = jar.get('pref', domain='example.com', path='/')
205: print(f"Pref for example.com: {pref_example}")
206: 
207: # Simple access might be ambiguous or pick one arbitrarily
208: # print(jar['pref']) # Could raise CookieConflictError or return one
209: ```
210: 
211: ## How It Works Internally
212: 
213: How does the `Session` manage this cookie magic?
214: 
215: 1.  **Sending Request:** When you call `s.get(...)` or `s.post(...)`, the `Session.prepare_request` method is called.
216:     *   It creates a `PreparedRequest` object.
217:     *   It merges cookies from your request (`cookies=...`), the session (`self.cookies`), and potentially environment settings.
218:     *   It calls `get_cookie_header(merged_cookies, prepared_request)` (from `requests.cookies`). This function checks the cookie jar for cookies that match the request's domain and path.
219:     *   It generates the `Cookie` header string (e.g., `Cookie: fruit=apple; username=Nate`) and adds it to the `PreparedRequest.headers`.
220:     *   The request (with the `Cookie` header) is then sent via a [Transport Adapter](07_transport_adapters.md).
221: 
222: 2.  **Receiving Response:** When the [Transport Adapter](07_transport_adapters.md) receives the raw HTTP response from the server:
223:     *   It builds the `Response` object.
224:     *   The `Session.send` method (or redirection logic) gets this `Response`.
225:     *   It calls `extract_cookies_to_jar(self.cookies, request, response.raw)` (from `requests.cookies`). This function looks for `Set-Cookie` headers in the raw response.
226:     *   It parses any `Set-Cookie` headers and adds/updates the corresponding cookies in the `Session`'s cookie jar (`self.cookies`).
227:     *   The final `Response` object is returned to you.
228: 
229: Here's a simplified diagram focusing on the cookie flow:

239:     User->>Sess: s.get(url)
240:     Sess->>Jar: get_cookie_header(url)
241:     Jar-->>Sess: Return matching cookie header string (e.g., "fruit=apple")
242:     Sess->>Adapter: send(request with 'Cookie' header)
243:     Adapter->>Server: Send HTTP Request (with Cookie: fruit=apple)
244:     Server-->>Adapter: Send HTTP Response (e.g., with Set-Cookie: new=cookie)
245:     Adapter->>Sess: Return raw response
246:     Sess->>Jar: extract_cookies_to_jar(raw response)
247:     Jar->>Jar: Add/Update 'new=cookie'
248:     Sess->>User: Return Response object
249: ```
250: 
251: You can see parts of this logic in `requests/sessions.py` and `requests/cookies.py`:

349:        pass
350:     # ... other dict methods ...
351: ```
352: 
353: The key is that `Session.send` calls `extract_cookies_to_jar` after receiving a response, and `PreparedRequest.prepare_cookies` (called via `Session.prepare_request`) calls `get_cookie_header` before sending the next one.
354: 
355: ## Conclusion
356: 
357: You've learned about the **Cookie Jar** (`RequestsCookieJar`), the mechanism `requests` (especially `Session` objects) uses to store and manage cookies. You saw:
358: 
359: *   How `Session` objects automatically use their cookie jar (`s.cookies`) to persist cookies across requests.
360: *   How `response.cookies` contains cookies set by a specific response.
361: *   How to interact with a `RequestsCookieJar` using its dictionary-like interface.
362: *   A glimpse into how `requests` extracts cookies from `Set-Cookie` headers and adds them back via the `Cookie` header.
363: 
364: Understanding the cookie jar helps explain how sessions maintain state and interact with websites that require logins or remember preferences.
365: 
366: Speaking of logging in, while cookies are often involved, sometimes websites require more explicit forms of identification, like usernames and passwords sent directly with the request. How does `requests` handle those?

  8: # Chapter 5: Authentication Handlers - Showing Your ID Card
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 4: The Cookie Jar](04_cookie_jar.md), we learned how `requests` uses `Session` objects and cookie jars to automatically remember things like login cookies. This is great for websites that use cookies to manage sessions after you log in.
 11: 
 12: But what about websites or APIs that require you to prove who you are *every time* you make a request, or use different methods than cookies? For example, some services need a username and password sent directly with the request, not just a cookie.
 13: 
 14: ## The Problem: Accessing Protected Resources
 15: 
 16: Imagine a website has a special members-only area. To access pages in this area, the server needs to know you're a valid member *right when you ask for the page*. It won't just let anyone in. It needs some form of identification, like a username and password.
 17: 
 18: How do we tell `requests` to include this identification with our request?
 19: 
 20: This is where **Authentication Handlers** come in.
 21: 
 22: ## What are Authentication Handlers?
 23: 
 24: Think of authentication handlers as different types of **ID badges** you can attach to your web requests. Just like you might need a specific badge to get into different parts of a building, different web services might require different types of authentication.
 25: 
 26: `Requests` has built-in support for common types (schemes) of HTTP authentication, and you can even create your own custom badges.
 27: 
 28: **Common ID Badges (Authentication Schemes):**
 29: 
 30: 1.  **HTTP Basic Auth:** This is the simplest type. It's like a badge with your username and password written directly on it (encoded, but easily decoded). It's common but not very secure over plain HTTP (HTTPS makes it safer).
 31:     *   `Requests` provides: A simple `(username, password)` tuple or the `HTTPBasicAuth` class.
 32: 2.  **HTTP Digest Auth:** This is a bit more secure than Basic. Instead of sending your password directly, it involves a challenge-response process, like the server asking a secret question based on your password, and your request providing the answer. It's more complex but avoids sending the password openly.
 33:     *   `Requests` provides: The `HTTPDigestAuth` class.
 34: 3.  **Custom Auth:** Some services use unique authentication methods (like OAuth1, OAuth2, custom API keys).
 35:     *   `Requests` allows you to create your own auth handlers by subclassing `AuthBase`. Many other libraries provide handlers for common schemes like OAuth.
 36: 
 37: When you provide authentication details to `requests`, it automatically figures out how to create and attach the correct `Authorization` header (or sometimes `Proxy-Authorization` for proxies) to your request. It's like pinning the right ID badge onto your request before sending it off.
 38: 
 39: ## Using Authentication Handlers
 40: 
 41: The easiest way to add authentication is by using the `auth` parameter when making a request, either with the functional API or with a [Session](03_session.md) object.
 42: 
 43: ### HTTP Basic Auth (The Easiest Way)
 44: 
 45: For Basic Auth, you can simply pass a tuple `(username, password)` to the `auth` argument.
 46: 
 47: Let's try accessing a test endpoint from `httpbin.org` that's protected with Basic Auth. The username is `testuser` and the password is `testpass`.
 48: 
 49: ```python
 50: import requests
 51: 
 52: # This URL requires Basic Auth with user='testuser', pass='testpass'
 53: url = 'https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/testuser/testpass'
 54: 
 55: # Try without authentication first (should fail with 401 Unauthorized)
 56: print("Attempting without authentication...")
 57: response_fail = requests.get(url)
 58: print(f"Status Code (fail): {response_fail.status_code}") # Expect 401
 59: 
 60: # Now, provide the username and password tuple to the 'auth' parameter
 61: print("\nAttempting with Basic Auth tuple...")
 62: try:
 63:     response_ok = requests.get(url, auth=('testuser', 'testpass'))
 64:     print(f"Status Code (ok): {response_ok.status_code}") # Expect 200
 65:     # Check the response content (httpbin echoes auth info)
 66:     print("Response JSON:")
 67:     print(response_ok.json())
 68: except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
 69:     print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
 70: 
 71: ```
 72: 
 73: **Output:**
 74: 
 75: ```
 76: Attempting without authentication...
 77: Status Code (fail): 401
 78: 
 79: Attempting with Basic Auth tuple...
 80: Status Code (ok): 200
 81: Response JSON:
 82: {'authenticated': True, 'user': 'testuser'}
 83: ```
 84: 
 85: **Explanation:**
 86: 
 87: 1.  The first request failed with `401 Unauthorized` because we didn't provide credentials.
 88: 2.  In the second request, we added `auth=('testuser', 'testpass')`.
 89: 3.  `Requests` automatically recognized this tuple, created the necessary `Authorization: Basic dGVzdHVzZXI6dGVzdHBhc3M=` header (where `dGVzdHVzZXI6dGVzdHBhc3M=` is the Base64 encoding of `testuser:testpass`), and added it to the request.
 90: 4.  The server validated the credentials and granted access, returning a `200 OK` status. The response body confirms we were authenticated as `testuser`.
 91: 
 92: ### Using the `HTTPBasicAuth` Class
 93: 
 94: Passing a tuple is a shortcut specifically for Basic Auth. For clarity, or if you want to reuse the authentication details, you can use the `HTTPBasicAuth` class explicitly. It does exactly the same thing internally.
 95: 
 96: ```python
 97: import requests
 98: from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth # Import the class
 99: 
100: url = 'https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/testuser/testpass'
101: 
102: # Create an HTTPBasicAuth object
103: basic_auth = HTTPBasicAuth('testuser', 'testpass')
104: 
105: # Pass the auth object to the 'auth' parameter
106: print("Attempting with HTTPBasicAuth object...")
107: try:
108:     response = requests.get(url, auth=basic_auth)
109:     print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}") # Expect 200
110:     print("Response JSON:")
111:     print(response.json())
112: except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
113:     print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
114: 
115: ```
116: 
117: **Output:**
118: 
119: ```
120: Attempting with HTTPBasicAuth object...
121: Status Code: 200
122: Response JSON:
123: {'authenticated': True, 'user': 'testuser'}
124: ```
125: 
126: This achieves the same result as the tuple, but `HTTPBasicAuth(user, pass)` is more explicit about the type of authentication being used.
127: 
128: ### HTTP Digest Auth
129: 
130: Digest Auth is more complex, involving a challenge from the server. `Requests` handles this complexity for you with the `HTTPDigestAuth` class. You use it similarly to `HTTPBasicAuth`.
131: 
132: ```python
133: import requests
134: from requests.auth import HTTPDigestAuth # Import the class
135: 
136: # httpbin has a digest auth endpoint
137: # user='testuser', pass='testpass'
138: url = 'https://httpbin.org/digest-auth/auth/testuser/testpass'
139: 
140: # Create an HTTPDigestAuth object
141: digest_auth = HTTPDigestAuth('testuser', 'testpass')
142: 
143: # Pass the auth object to the 'auth' parameter
144: print("Attempting with HTTPDigestAuth object...")
145: try:
146:     response = requests.get(url, auth=digest_auth)
147:     print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}") # Expect 200
148:     print("Response JSON:")
149:     print(response.json())
150:     # Note: It might take two requests internally for Digest Auth
151:     print(f"Request History (if any): {response.history}")
152: except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
153:     print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
154: 
155: ```
156: 
157: **Output:**
158: 
159: ```
160: Attempting with HTTPDigestAuth object...
161: Status Code: 200
162: Response JSON:
163: {'authenticated': True, 'user': 'testuser'}
164: Request History (if any): [<Response [401]>]
165: ```
166: 
167: **Explanation:**
168: 
169: 1.  We used `HTTPDigestAuth` this time.
170: 2.  When `requests` first tries to access the URL, the server challenges it with a `401 Unauthorized` response containing details needed for Digest Auth (like a `nonce` and `realm`). You can see this `401` response in `response.history`.
171: 3.  The `HTTPDigestAuth` handler catches this `401`, uses the challenge information and your password to calculate the correct response, and automatically sends a *second* request with the proper `Authorization: Digest ...` header.
172: 4.  This second request succeeds, and you get the final `200 OK` response.
173: 
174: `Requests` handles the two-step process automatically when you use `HTTPDigestAuth`.
175: 
176: ### Persistent Authentication with Sessions
177: 
178: If you need to make multiple requests to the same server using the same authentication, it's much more efficient to set the authentication on a [Session](03_session.md) object. The session will then automatically apply the authentication to *all* requests made through it.
179: 
180: ```python
181: import requests
182: from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
183: 
184: basic_auth_url = 'https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/testuser/testpass'
185: headers_url = 'https://httpbin.org/headers' # Just to see headers sent
186: 
187: # Create a session
188: with requests.Session() as s:
189:     # Set the authentication ONCE on the session
190:     s.auth = HTTPBasicAuth('testuser', 'testpass')
191:     # Or: s.auth = ('testuser', 'testpass')
192: 
193:     # Make the first request (auth will be added automatically)
194:     print("Making first request using session auth...")
195:     response1 = s.get(basic_auth_url)
196:     print(f"Status Code 1: {response1.status_code}")
197: 
198:     # Make a second request to a different endpoint (auth will also be added)
199:     # We use /headers to see the Authorization header being sent
200:     print("\nMaking second request using session auth...")
201:     response2 = s.get(headers_url)
202:     print(f"Status Code 2: {response2.status_code}")
203:     print("Headers sent in second request:")
204:     # Look for the 'Authorization' header in the output
205:     print(response2.json()['headers'])
206: ```
207: 
208: **Output:**
209: 
210: ```
211: Making first request using session auth...
212: Status Code 1: 200
213: 
214: Making second request using session auth...
215: Status Code 2: 200
216: Headers sent in second request:
217: {
218:   "Accept": "*/*",
219:   "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate",
220:   "Authorization": "Basic dGVzdHVzZXI6dGVzdHBhc3M=", // <-- Auth header added automatically!
221:   "Host": "httpbin.org",
222:   "User-Agent": "python-requests/2.x.y",
223:   "X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=..."
224: }
225: ```
226: 
227: By setting `s.auth = ...`, we ensured that *both* requests sent the `Authorization` header without needing to specify it in each `s.get()` call.
228: 
229: ### Custom Authentication
230: 
231: What if a service uses a completely different way to authenticate? `Requests` allows you to create your own authentication handler by writing a class that inherits from `requests.auth.AuthBase` and implements the `__call__` method. This method receives the `PreparedRequest` object and should modify it (usually by adding headers) as needed.
232: 
233: ```python
234: from requests.auth import AuthBase
235: 
236: class MyCustomApiKeyAuth(AuthBase):
237:     """Attaches a custom API Key header to the request."""
238:     def __init__(self, api_key):
239:         self.api_key = api_key
240: 
241:     def __call__(self, r):
242:         # 'r' is the PreparedRequest object
243:         # Modify the request 'r' here. We'll add a header.
244:         r.headers['X-API-Key'] = self.api_key
245:         # We MUST return the modified request object
246:         return r
247: 
248: # Usage:
249: # api_key = "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY"
250: # response = requests.get(some_url, auth=MyCustomApiKeyAuth(api_key))
251: ```
252: 
253: This is more advanced, but it shows the flexibility of the `requests` auth system. Many third-party libraries use this pattern to provide auth helpers for specific services (like OAuth).
254: 
255: ## How It Works Internally
256: 
257: How does `requests` take the `auth` parameter and turn it into the correct `Authorization` header?
258: 
259: 1.  **Preparation Step:** When you make a request (e.g., `requests.get(url, auth=...)` or `s.request(...)`), the `Request` object is turned into a `PreparedRequest` as we saw in [Chapter 2: Request & Response Models](02_request___response_models.md). Part of this preparation involves the `prepare_auth` method.
260: 2.  **Check Auth Type:** Inside `prepare_auth`, `requests` checks the `auth` parameter.
261:     *   If `auth` is a tuple `(user, pass)`, it automatically wraps it in an `HTTPBasicAuth(user, pass)` object.
262:     *   If `auth` is already an object (like `HTTPBasicAuth`, `HTTPDigestAuth`, or a custom one inheriting from `AuthBase`), it uses that object directly.
263: 3.  **Call the Auth Object:** All authentication handler objects (including the built-in ones) are **callable**. This means they have a `__call__` method. The `prepare_auth` step *calls* the auth object, passing the `PreparedRequest` object (`p`) to it: `auth(p)`.
264: 4.  **Modify the Request:** The `__call__` method of the auth object does the actual work.
265:     *   For `HTTPBasicAuth`, the `__call__` method calculates the `Basic base64(user:pass)` string and sets `p.headers['Authorization'] = ...`.
266:     *   For `HTTPDigestAuth`, the `__call__` method might initially set up hooks to handle the `401` challenge, or if it already has the necessary info (like a `nonce`), it calculates the `Digest ...` header and sets `p.headers['Authorization']`.
267:     *   For a custom auth object, its `__call__` method performs whatever modifications are needed (e.g., adding an `X-API-Key` header).
268: 5.  **Return Modified Request:** The `__call__` method *must* return the modified `PreparedRequest` object.
269: 6.  **Send Request:** The `PreparedRequest`, now potentially including an `Authorization` header, is sent to the server.
270: 
271: Here's a simplified sequence diagram for Basic Auth:
272: 
273: ```mermaid

285:     PrepReq->>AuthObj: Call auth_obj(p)
286:     activate AuthObj
287:     AuthObj->>AuthObj: Calculate 'Basic ...' string

296: 
297: Let's look at the simplified code in `requests/auth.py` for `HTTPBasicAuth`:
298: 
299: ```python
300: # File: requests/auth.py (Simplified)
301: 
302: from base64 import b64encode
303: from ._internal_utils import to_native_string
304: 
305: def _basic_auth_str(username, password):
306:     """Returns a Basic Auth string."""
307:     # ... (handle encoding username/password to bytes) ...
308:     auth_bytes = b":".join((username_bytes, password_bytes))
309:     auth_b64 = b64encode(auth_bytes).strip()
310:     # Return native string (str in Py3) e.g., "Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz"
311:     return "Basic " + to_native_string(auth_b64)
312: 
313: class AuthBase:
314:     """Base class that all auth implementations derive from"""
315:     def __call__(self, r):
316:         # This method MUST be overridden by subclasses
317:         raise NotImplementedError("Auth hooks must be callable.")
318: 
319: class HTTPBasicAuth(AuthBase):

326:         # 'r' is the PreparedRequest object passed in by requests
327:         # Calculate the Basic auth string
328:         auth_header_value = _basic_auth_str(self.username, self.password)
329:         # Modify the request's headers
330:         r.headers['Authorization'] = auth_header_value
331:         # Return the modified request
332:         return r
333:

335:     """Attaches HTTP Proxy Authentication to a given Request object."""
336:     def __call__(self, r):

338:         r.headers['Proxy-Authorization'] = _basic_auth_str(self.username, self.password)
339:         return r
340: 
341: # HTTPDigestAuth is more complex, involving state and hooks for the 401 challenge
342: class HTTPDigestAuth(AuthBase):
343:     def __init__(self, username, password):
344:         # ... store username/password ...
345:         # ... initialize state (nonce, etc.) ...
346:         pass
347: 
348:     def build_digest_header(self, method, url):

350:         return "Digest ..." # Calculated digest header
351: 
352:     def handle_401(self, r, **kwargs):
353:         # Hook called when a 401 response is received
354:         # 1. Parse challenge ('WWW-Authenticate' header)
355:         # 2. Store nonce, realm etc.
356:         # 3. Prepare a *new* request with the calculated digest header
357:         # 4. Send the new request
358:         # 5. Return the response to the *new* request
359:         pass # Simplified
360: 
361:     def __call__(self, r):
362:         # 'r' is the PreparedRequest
363:         # If we already have a nonce, add the Authorization header directly
364:         if self.has_nonce():
365:             r.headers['Authorization'] = self.build_digest_header(r.method, r.url)
366:         # Register the handle_401 hook to handle the server challenge if needed
367:         r.register_hook('response', self.handle_401)
368:         return r
369: ```
370: 
371: And in `requests/models.py`, the `PreparedRequest` calls the auth object:
372: 
373: ```python
374: # File: requests/models.py (Simplified View)
375: 
376: from .auth import HTTPBasicAuth
377: from .utils import get_auth_from_url
378: 
379: class PreparedRequest(RequestEncodingMixin, RequestHooksMixin):
380:     # ... (other prepare methods like prepare_url, prepare_headers) ...
381: 
382:     def prepare_auth(self, auth, url=""):
383:         """Prepares the given HTTP auth data."""
384: 
385:         # If no Auth provided, maybe get it from the URL (e.g., http://user:pass@host)
386:         if auth is None:
387:             url_auth = get_auth_from_url(self.url)
388:             auth = url_auth if any(url_auth) else None
389: 
390:         if auth:
391:             # If auth is a ('user', 'pass') tuple, wrap it in HTTPBasicAuth
392:             if isinstance(auth, tuple) and len(auth) == 2:
393:                 auth = HTTPBasicAuth(*auth)
394: 
395:             # --- The Core Step ---
396:             # Call the auth object (which must be callable, like AuthBase subclasses)
397:             # Pass 'self' (the PreparedRequest instance) to the auth object's __call__
398:             r = auth(self)
399: 
400:             # Update self to reflect any changes made by the auth object
401:             # (Auth objects typically just modify headers, but could do more)
402:             self.__dict__.update(r.__dict__)
403: 
404:             # Recompute Content-Length in case auth modified the body (unlikely for Basic/Digest)
405:             self.prepare_content_length(self.body)
406: 
407:     # ... (rest of PreparedRequest) ...
408: ```
409: 
410: The key is the `r = auth(self)` line, where the `PreparedRequest` delegates the task of adding authentication details to the specific authentication handler object provided.
411: 
412: ## Conclusion
413: 
414: You've learned how `requests` handles HTTP authentication using **Authentication Handlers**.
415: 
416: *   You saw that authentication is like providing an **ID badge** with your request.
417: *   You learned about common schemes like **Basic Auth** (using a simple `(user, pass)` tuple or `HTTPBasicAuth`) and **Digest Auth** (`HTTPDigestAuth`).
418: *   You know how to apply authentication to single requests or persistently using a [Session](03_session.md) object via the `auth` parameter.
419: *   You understand that internally, `requests` calls the provided auth object, which modifies the `PreparedRequest` (usually by adding an `Authorization` header) before sending it.
420: *   You got a glimpse of how custom authentication can be built using `AuthBase`.
421: 
422: Authentication is crucial for accessing protected resources. But what happens when things go wrong? A server might be down, a URL might be invalid, or authentication might fail. How does `requests` tell you about these problems?

  8: # Chapter 6: When Things Go Wrong - The Exception Hierarchy
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 5: Authentication Handlers](05_authentication_handlers.md), we learned how to prove our identity to websites that require login or API keys. We assumed our requests would work if we provided the correct credentials.
 11: 
 12: But what happens when things *don't* go as planned? The internet isn't always reliable. Websites go down, networks have hiccups, URLs might be typed incorrectly, or servers might just be having a bad day. How does `requests` tell us about these problems, and how can we handle them gracefully in our code?
 13: 
 14: ## The Problem: Dealing with Request Failures
 15: 
 16: Imagine you're building a script to check the weather using an online weather API. You use `requests.get()` to fetch the weather data. What could go wrong?
 17: 
 18: *   Your internet connection might be down.
 19: *   The weather API website might be temporarily offline.
 20: *   You might have mistyped the URL.
 21: *   The website might take too long to respond (a timeout).
 22: *   The website might respond, but with an error message (like "404 Not Found" or "500 Server Error").
 23: 
 24: If any of these happen, `requests` will encounter an error. If you don't prepare for these errors, your script might crash! We need a way to:
 25: 
 26: 1.  **Detect** that an error occurred.
 27: 2.  **Understand** *what kind* of error it was (network issue? timeout? bad URL?).
 28: 3.  **React** appropriately (e.g., print a helpful message, try again later, use a default value).
 29: 
 30: ## The Solution: A Family Tree of Errors
 31: 
 32: `Requests` helps us by using a system of specific error messages called **exceptions**. When something goes wrong, `requests` doesn't just give up silently; it **raises an exception**.
 33: 
 34: Think of it like a doctor diagnosing an illness. A doctor doesn't just say "You're sick." They give a specific diagnosis: "You have the flu," or "You have a broken arm," or "You have allergies." Each diagnosis tells you something specific about the problem and how to treat it.
 35: 
 36: `Requests` does something similar with its exceptions. It has a main, general exception called `requests.exceptions.RequestException`. All other specific `requests` errors are "children" or "descendants" of this main one, forming an **Exception Hierarchy** (like a family tree).
 37: 
 38: **Analogy:** The "Sickness" Family Tree 🌳
 39: 
 40: *   **`RequestException` (The Grandparent):** This is the most general category, like saying "Sickness." If you catch this, you catch *any* problem related to `requests`.
 41: *   **`ConnectionError`, `Timeout`, `HTTPError`, `URLRequired` (The Parents):** These are more specific categories under `RequestException`.
 42:     *   `ConnectionError` is like saying "Infection."
 43:     *   `Timeout` is like saying "Fatigue."
 44:     *   `HTTPError` is like saying "External Injury."
 45:     *   `URLRequired` is like saying "Genetic Condition" (problem with the input itself).
 46: *   **`ConnectTimeout`, `ReadTimeout` (The Children):** These are even *more* specific.
 47:     *   `ConnectTimeout` (child of `Timeout`) is like "Trouble Falling Asleep."
 48:     *   `ReadTimeout` (child of `Timeout`) is like "Waking Up Too Early." Both are types of "Fatigue" (`Timeout`).
 49: 
 50: This hierarchy allows you to decide how specific you want to be when handling errors.
 51: 
 52: ## Key Members of the Exception Family
 53: 
 54: All `requests` exceptions live inside the `requests.exceptions` module. You usually import the main `requests` library and access them like `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.
 55: 
 56: Here are some of the most common ones you'll encounter:
 57: 
 58: *   **`requests.exceptions.RequestException`**: The base exception. Catching this catches *all* exceptions listed below.
 59: *   **`requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`**: Problems connecting to the server. This could be due to:
 60:     *   DNS failure (can't find the server's address).
 61:     *   Refused connection (server is there but not accepting connections).
 62:     *   Network is unreachable.
 63: *   **`requests.exceptions.Timeout`**: The request took too long. This is a parent category for:
 64:     *   **`requests.exceptions.ConnectTimeout`**: Timeout occurred *while trying to establish the connection*.
 65:     *   **`requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout`**: Timeout occurred *after connecting*, while waiting for the server to send data.
 66: *   **`requests.exceptions.HTTPError`**: Raised when the server returns a "bad" status code (4xx for client errors like "404 Not Found", or 5xx for server errors like "500 Internal Server Error"). **Important:** `requests` does *not* automatically raise this just because the status code is bad. You typically need to call the `response.raise_for_status()` method to trigger it.
 67: *   **`requests.exceptions.TooManyRedirects`**: The request exceeded the maximum number of allowed redirects (usually 30).
 68: *   **`requests.exceptions.URLRequired`**: You tried to make a request without providing a URL.
 69: *   **`requests.exceptions.MissingSchema`**: The URL was missing the scheme (like `http://` or `https://`).
 70: *   **`requests.exceptions.InvalidURL`**: The URL was malformed in some way.
 71: *   **`requests.exceptions.InvalidSchema`**: The URL scheme was not recognized (e.g., `ftp://` might not be supported by default).
 72: 
 73: ## Handling Exceptions: The `try...except` Block
 74: 
 75: How do we use this hierarchy in our code? We use Python's `try...except` block.
 76: 
 77: 1.  Put the code that *might* cause an error (like `requests.get()`) inside the `try:` block.
 78: 2.  Follow it with one or more `except:` blocks. Each `except:` block specifies the type of exception it's designed to catch.
 79: 
 80: **Example 1: Catching Any `requests` Error**
 81: 
 82: Let's try fetching a URL that doesn't exist and catch the most general exception.
 83: 
 84: ```python
 85: import requests
 86: 
 87: # A URL that might cause a connection error (e.g., non-existent domain)
 88: bad_url = 'https://this-domain-probably-does-not-exist-asdfghjkl.com'
 89: good_url = 'https://httpbin.org/get'
 90: 
 91: url_to_try = bad_url # Change to good_url to see success case
 92: 
 93: print(f"Trying to fetch: {url_to_try}")
 94: 
 95: try:
 96:     response = requests.get(url_to_try, timeout=5) # Add timeout
 97:     response.raise_for_status() # Check for 4xx/5xx errors
 98:     print("Success! Status Code:", response.status_code)
 99:     # Process the response... (e.g., print response.text)
100: 
101: except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
102:     # This will catch ANY error originating from requests
103:     print(f"\nOh no! A requests-related error occurred:")
104:     print(f"Error Type: {type(e).__name__}")
105:     print(f"Error Details: {e}")
106: 
107: print("\nScript continues after handling the error.")
108: ```
109: 
110: **Possible Output (if `url_to_try = bad_url`):**
111: 
112: ```
113: Trying to fetch: https://this-domain-probably-does-not-exist-asdfghjkl.com
114: 
115: Oh no! A requests-related error occurred:
116: Error Type: ConnectionError
117: Error Details: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='this-domain-probably-does-not-exist-asdfghjkl.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by NameResolutionError("<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x...>: Failed to resolve 'this-domain-probably-does-not-exist-asdfghjkl.com' ([Errno ...)"))
118: 
119: Script continues after handling the error.
120: ```
121: 
122: **Explanation:**
123: 
124: *   We put `requests.get()` and `response.raise_for_status()` inside the `try` block.
125: *   If `requests.get()` fails (e.g., due to `ConnectionError` or `Timeout`), or if `raise_for_status()` detects a 4xx/5xx code (`HTTPError`), an exception is raised.
126: *   The `except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:` block catches it because `ConnectionError`, `Timeout`, and `HTTPError` are all descendants of `RequestException`.
127: *   We print a helpful message and the details of the error (`e`). Crucially, the script *doesn't crash*.
128: 
129: **Example 2: Catching Specific Errors**
130: 
131: Sometimes, you want to react differently based on the *type* of error. Was it a temporary network glitch, or did the server permanently remove the page?
132: 
133: ```python
134: import requests
135: 
136: # URL that gives a 404 error
137: not_found_url = 'https://httpbin.org/status/404'
138: # URL that is slow and might time out
139: timeout_url = 'https://httpbin.org/delay/5' # Delays response by 5 seconds
140: 
141: url_to_try = timeout_url # Change to not_found_url to see HTTPError
142: 
143: print(f"Trying to fetch: {url_to_try}")
144: 
145: try:
146:     # Set a short timeout to demonstrate Timeout exception
147:     response = requests.get(url_to_try, timeout=2)
148:     response.raise_for_status() # Check for 4xx/5xx status codes
149:     print("Success! Status Code:", response.status_code)
150:     # Process response...
151: 
152: except requests.exceptions.ConnectTimeout as e:
153:     print(f"\nError: Could not connect to the server in time.")
154:     print(f"Details: {e}")
155:     # Maybe retry later?
156: 
157: except requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout as e:
158:     print(f"\nError: Server took too long to send data.")
159:     print(f"Details: {e}")
160:     # Maybe the server is slow, could try again?
161: 
162: except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as e:
163:     print(f"\nError: Network problem (e.g., DNS error, refused connection).")
164:     print(f"Details: {e}")
165:     # Check internet connection?
166: 
167: except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
168:     print(f"\nError: Bad HTTP status code received from server.")
169:     print(f"Status Code: {e.response.status_code}")
170:     print(f"Details: {e}")
171:     # Was it a 404 Not Found? 500 Server Error?
172: 
173: except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
174:     # Catch any other requests error that wasn't specifically handled above
175:     print(f"\nAn unexpected requests error occurred:")
176:     print(f"Error Type: {type(e).__name__}")
177:     print(f"Details: {e}")
178: 
179: print("\nScript continues...")
180: ```
181: 
182: **Possible Output (if `url_to_try = timeout_url`):**
183: 
184: ```
185: Trying to fetch: https://httpbin.org/delay/5
186: 
187: Error: Server took too long to send data.
188: Details: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='httpbin.org', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=2)
189: 
190: Script continues...

204: 
205: **Explanation:**
206: 
207: *   We have multiple `except` blocks, ordered from most specific (`ConnectTimeout`, `ReadTimeout`) to more general (`ConnectionError`, `HTTPError`) and finally the catch-all `RequestException`.
208: *   Python tries the `except` blocks in order. When an exception occurs, the *first* matching block is executed.
209: *   If a `ReadTimeout` occurs, the `except requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout` block handles it. It won't fall through to the `except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` or `except requests.exceptions.RequestException` blocks, even though `ReadTimeout` *is* a type of `RequestException`.
210: *   This allows us to provide specific feedback or recovery logic for different error scenarios.
211: 
212: **Inheritance Benefit:** If you write `except requests.exceptions.Timeout as e:`, this block will catch *both* `ConnectTimeout` and `ReadTimeout` because they inherit from `Timeout`.
213: 
214: ## How It Works Internally: Wrapping Lower-Level Errors
215: 
216: `Requests` doesn't handle network connections directly. It uses a lower-level library called `urllib3` under the hood (managed via [Transport Adapters](07_transport_adapters.md)). When `urllib3` encounters a network problem (like a connection error or timeout), it raises its *own* specific exceptions (e.g., `urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError`, `urllib3.exceptions.NewConnectionError`, `urllib3.exceptions.ReadTimeoutError`).
217: 
218: `Requests` catches these `urllib3` exceptions inside its [Transport Adapters](07_transport_adapters.md) (specifically, the `HTTPAdapter.send` method) and then **raises its own corresponding exception** from the `requests.exceptions` hierarchy. This simplifies things for you – you only need to worry about catching `requests` exceptions, not the underlying `urllib3` ones.

241: 
242: Let's look at the definitions in `requests/exceptions.py`. You can see the inheritance structure clearly:
243: 
244: ```python
245: # File: requests/exceptions.py (Simplified View)
246: 
247: from urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as BaseHTTPError
248: 
249: # The base class for all requests exceptions
250: class RequestException(IOError):
251:     """There was an ambiguous exception that occurred while handling your request."""
252:     # ... (stores request/response objects) ...
253: 
254: # Specific exceptions inheriting from RequestException or other requests exceptions

257: 
258: class ConnectionError(RequestException):
259:     """A Connection error occurred."""
260: 
261: class ProxyError(ConnectionError): # Inherits from ConnectionError
262:     """A proxy error occurred."""
263: 
264: class SSLError(ConnectionError): # Inherits from ConnectionError
265:     """An SSL error occurred."""
266: 
267: class Timeout(RequestException): # Inherits directly from RequestException
268:     """The request timed out."""
269: 
270: class ConnectTimeout(ConnectionError, Timeout): # Inherits from BOTH ConnectionError and Timeout!
271:     """The request timed out while trying to connect to the remote server."""
272: 
273: class ReadTimeout(Timeout): # Inherits from Timeout
274:     """The server did not send any data in the allotted amount of time."""
275: 
276: class URLRequired(RequestException):
277:     """A valid URL is required to make a request."""
278: 
279: class TooManyRedirects(RequestException):
280:     """Too many redirects."""
281: 
282: # ... other specific errors like MissingSchema, InvalidURL, etc. ...
283: 
284: # Some exceptions might also inherit from standard Python errors
285: class JSONDecodeError(RequestException, ValueError): # Inherits from RequestException and ValueError
286:     """Couldn't decode the text into json"""
287:     # Uses Python's built-in JSONDecodeError capabilities
288: 
289: ```
290: 
291: And here's a simplified view of how `requests/adapters.py` (`HTTPAdapter.send`) catches `urllib3` errors and raises `requests` errors:
292: 
293: ```python
294: # File: requests/adapters.py (Simplified View in HTTPAdapter.send method)
295: 
296: from urllib3.exceptions import (
297:     MaxRetryError, ConnectTimeoutError, NewConnectionError, ResponseError,

311: 
312:         try:
313:             # === Make the actual request using urllib3 ===
314:             resp = conn.urlopen(
315:                 method=request.method,
316:                 url=url,

318:                 retries=self.max_retries,
319:                 timeout=timeout,
320:             )
321: 
322:         # === Catch specific urllib3 errors and raise corresponding requests errors ===
323: 
324:         except (ProtocolError, OSError) as err: # General network/protocol errors
325:             raise ConnectionError(err, request=request)
326:

330:             if isinstance(e.reason, ResponseError): # Errors related to retry logic
331:                 raise RetryError(e, request=request)
332:             if isinstance(e.reason, _ProxyError):
333:                 raise ProxyError(e, request=request)
334:             if isinstance(e.reason, _SSLError):
335:                 raise SSLError(e, request=request)
336:             # Fallback for other retry errors
337:             raise ConnectionError(e, request=request)
338: 
339:         except ClosedPoolError as e: # Connection pool was closed
340:             raise ConnectionError(e, request=request)
341: 
342:         except _ProxyError as e: # Direct proxy error
343:             raise ProxyError(e)
344: 
345:         except (_SSLError, ReadTimeoutError, _InvalidHeader) as e: # Other specific errors
346:             if isinstance(e, _SSLError):
347:                 raise SSLError(e, request=request)
348:             elif isinstance(e, ReadTimeoutError):
349:                 raise ReadTimeout(e, request=request)
350:             elif isinstance(e, _InvalidHeader):
351:                 raise InvalidHeader(e, request=request)
352:             else:
353:                 # Should not happen, but raise generic RequestException if needed
354:                 raise RequestException(e, request=request)
355: 
356:         # ... (build and return the Response object if successful) ...
357:         return self.build_response(request, resp)
358: ```
359: 
360: This wrapping makes your life easier by providing a consistent set of exceptions (`requests.exceptions`) to handle, regardless of the underlying `urllib3` details.
361: 
362: ## Conclusion
363: 
364: You've learned about the `requests` **Exception Hierarchy** – a family tree of error types that `requests` raises when things go wrong.
365: 
366: *   You saw that all `requests` exceptions inherit from the base `requests.exceptions.RequestException`.
367: *   You learned about key specific exceptions like `ConnectionError`, `Timeout` (and its children `ConnectTimeout`, `ReadTimeout`), and `HTTPError` (raised by `response.raise_for_status()`).
368: *   You practiced using `try...except` blocks to catch both general (`RequestException`) and specific exceptions, allowing for tailored error handling.
369: *   You understood that `requests` wraps lower-level errors (from `urllib3`) into its own exception types, simplifying error handling for you.
370: 
371: Understanding this hierarchy is crucial for writing robust Python code that can gracefully handle the inevitable problems that occur when dealing with networks and web services.
372: 
373: So far, we've mostly used the default way `requests` handles connections. But what if we need more control over how connections are made, maybe to configure retries differently, or use different SSL settings? That's where Transport Adapters come in.

  8: # Chapter 7: Transport Adapters - Custom Delivery Routes
  9: 
 10: In the previous chapter, [Chapter 6: Exception Hierarchy](06_exception_hierarchy.md), we learned how `requests` signals problems like network errors or bad responses. Most of the time, we rely on the default way `requests` handles sending our requests and managing connections.
 11: 
 12: But what if the default way isn't quite right for a specific website or service? What if you need to tell `requests` *exactly* how to handle connections or retries for URLs starting with `http://` or `https://`, or maybe even for a completely custom scheme like `myprotocol://`?
 13: 
 14: ## The Problem: Needing Special Handling
 15: 
 16: Imagine you're interacting with an API that's known to be a bit unreliable. Sometimes requests to it fail temporarily, but succeed if you just try again a second later. The default `requests` behavior might not retry enough times, or maybe you want to retry only on specific error codes.
 17: 
 18: Or perhaps you need to connect to a server using very specific security settings (SSL/TLS versions or ciphers) that aren't the default.
 19: 
 20: How can you customize *how* `requests` sends requests and manages connections for specific types of URLs?
 21: 
 22: ## Meet Transport Adapters: The Delivery Services
 23: 
 24: This is where **Transport Adapters** come in!
 25: 
 26: Think of a `requests` [Session](03_session.md) object like a customer ordering packages online. The customer (Session) wants to send a package (a web request) to a specific address (a URL).
 27: 
 28: **Transport Adapters** are like the different **delivery services** (like FedEx, UPS, USPS, or maybe a specialized local courier) that the customer can choose from.
 29: 
 30: *   Each delivery service specializes in certain types of addresses or delivery methods.
 31: *   When the customer has a package for a specific address (e.g., starting with `https://`), they pick the appropriate delivery service registered for that address type.
 32: *   That delivery service then handles all the details of picking up, transporting, and delivering the package (sending the request, managing connections, handling retries, etc.).
 33: 
 34: In `requests`, a Transport Adapter defines *how* requests are actually sent and connections are managed for specific **URL schemes** (like `http://` or `https://`).
 35: 
 36: ## The Default Delivery Service: `HTTPAdapter`
 37: 
 38: By default, when you create a `Session` object, it automatically sets up the standard "delivery services" for web addresses:
 39: 
 40: *   For URLs starting with `https://`, it uses the built-in `requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter`.
 41: *   For URLs starting with `http://`, it also uses the `requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter`.
 42: 
 43: This `HTTPAdapter` is the workhorse. It doesn't handle the network sockets directly; instead, it uses another powerful library called `urllib3` under the hood.
 44: 
 45: The `HTTPAdapter` (via `urllib3`) is responsible for:
 46: 
 47: 1.  **Connection Pooling:** Reusing existing network connections to the same host for better performance (like the delivery service keeping its trucks warm and ready for the next delivery to the same neighborhood). We saw the benefits of this in [Chapter 3: Session](03_session.md).
 48: 2.  **HTTP/HTTPS Details:** Handling the specifics of the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
 49: 3.  **SSL Verification:** Making sure the website's security certificate is valid for HTTPS connections.
 50: 4.  **Basic Retries:** Handling some low-level connection retries (though often you might want more control).
 51: 
 52: So, when you use a `Session` and make a `GET` request to `https://example.com`, the Session looks up the adapter for `https://`, finds the default `HTTPAdapter`, and hands the request off to it for delivery.
 53: 
 54: ## Mounting Adapters: Choosing Your Delivery Service
 55: 
 56: How does a `Session` know which adapter to use for which URL prefix? It uses a mechanism called **mounting**.
 57: 
 58: Think of it like telling your `Session` customer: "For any address starting with `https://`, use this specific delivery service (adapter)."
 59: 
 60: A `Session` object has an `adapters` attribute, which is an ordered dictionary. You use the `session.mount(prefix, adapter)` method to register an adapter for a given URL prefix.
 61: 
 62: ```python
 63: import requests
 64: from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
 65: 
 66: # Create a session
 67: s = requests.Session()
 68: 
 69: # See the default adapters that are already mounted
 70: print("Default Adapters:")
 71: print(s.adapters)
 72: 
 73: # Create a *new* instance of the default HTTPAdapter
 74: # (Maybe we'll configure it later)
 75: custom_adapter = HTTPAdapter()
 76: 
 77: # Mount this adapter for a specific website
 78: # Now, any request to this specific host via HTTPS will use our custom_adapter
 79: print("\nMounting custom adapter for https://httpbin.org")
 80: s.mount('https://httpbin.org', custom_adapter)
 81: 
 82: # Let's mount another one for all HTTP traffic
 83: plain_http_adapter = HTTPAdapter()
 84: print("Mounting another adapter for all http://")
 85: s.mount('http://', plain_http_adapter)
 86: 
 87: # Check the adapters again (they are ordered by prefix length, longest first)
 88: print("\nAdapters after mounting:")
 89: print(s.adapters)
 90: 
 91: # When we make a request, the session finds the best matching prefix
 92: print(f"\nAdapter for 'https://httpbin.org/get': {s.get_adapter('https://httpbin.org/get')}")
 93: print(f"Adapter for 'http://example.com': {s.get_adapter('http://example.com')}")
 94: print(f"Adapter for 'https://google.com': {s.get_adapter('https://google.com')}") # Uses default https://
 95: ```
 96: 
 97: **Output:**
 98: 
 99: ```
100: Default Adapters:
101: OrderedDict([('https://', <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter object at 0x...>), ('http://', <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter object at 0x...>)])
102: 
103: Mounting custom adapter for https://httpbin.org
104: Mounting another adapter for all http://
105: 
106: Adapters after mounting:
107: OrderedDict([('https://httpbin.org', <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter object at 0x...>), ('https://', <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter object at 0x...>), ('http://', <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter object at 0x...>)])
108: 
109: Adapter for 'https://httpbin.org/get': <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter object at 0x...>
110: Adapter for 'http://example.com': <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter object at 0x...>
111: Adapter for 'https://google.com': <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter object at 0x...>
112: ```
113: 
114: **Explanation:**
115: 
116: 1.  Initially, the session has default `HTTPAdapter` instances mounted for `https://` and `http://`.
117: 2.  We created new `HTTPAdapter` instances.
118: 3.  We used `s.mount('https://httpbin.org', custom_adapter)`. Now, requests to `https://httpbin.org/anything` will use `custom_adapter`.
119: 4.  We used `s.mount('http://', plain_http_adapter)`. This *replaced* the original default adapter for `http://`.
120: 5.  Requests to other HTTPS sites like `https://google.com` will still use the original default adapter mounted for the shorter `https://` prefix.
121: 6.  The `s.get_adapter(url)` method shows how the session selects the adapter based on the longest matching prefix.
122: 
123: ## Use Case: Customizing Retries
124: 
125: Let's go back to the unreliable API example. We want to configure `requests` to automatically retry requests to `https://flaky-api.example.com` up to 5 times if certain errors occur (like temporary server errors or connection issues).
126: 
127: The `HTTPAdapter`'s retry logic is controlled by a `Retry` object from the underlying `urllib3` library. We can create our own `Retry` object with custom settings and pass it to a *new* `HTTPAdapter` instance.
128: 
129: ```python
130: import requests
131: from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
132: from urllib3.util.retry import Retry # Import the Retry class
133: 
134: # 1. Configure the retry strategy
135: #    - total=5: Try up to 5 times in total
136: #    - backoff_factor=0.5: Wait 0.5s, 1s, 2s, 4s between retries
137: #    - status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504]: Only retry on these HTTP status codes
138: #    - allowed_methods=False: Retry for all methods (GET, POST, etc.) by default. Use ["GET", "POST"] to restrict.
139: retry_strategy = Retry(
140:     total=5,
141:     backoff_factor=0.5,
142:     status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504],
143:     # allowed_methods=False # Default includes most common methods
144: )
145: 
146: # 2. Create an HTTPAdapter with this retry strategy
147: #    The 'max_retries' argument accepts a Retry object
148: adapter_with_retries = HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retry_strategy)
149: 
150: # 3. Create a Session
151: session = requests.Session()
152: 
153: # 4. Mount the adapter for the specific API prefix
154: api_base_url = 'https://flaky-api.example.com/' # Use the base URL prefix
155: session.mount(api_base_url, adapter_with_retries)
156: 
157: # 5. Now, use the session to make requests to the flaky API
158: api_endpoint = f"{api_base_url}data"
159: print(f"Making request to {api_endpoint} with custom retries...")
160: 
161: try:
162:     # Imagine this API sometimes returns 503 Service Unavailable
163:     response = session.get(api_endpoint)
164:     response.raise_for_status() # Check for HTTP errors
165:     print("Success!")
166:     # print(response.json()) # Process the successful response
167: except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
168:     print(f"Request failed after retries: {e}")
169: 
170: # Requests to other domains will use the default adapter/retries
171: print("\nMaking request to a different site (default retries)...")
172: try:
173:     response_other = session.get('https://httpbin.org/get')
174:     print(f"Status for httpbin: {response_other.status_code}")
175: except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
176:     print(f"Httpbin request failed: {e}")
177: 
178: ```
179: 
180: **Explanation:**
181: 
182: 1.  We defined our desired retry behavior using `urllib3.util.retry.Retry`.
183: 2.  We created a *new* `HTTPAdapter`, passing our `retry_strategy` to its `max_retries` parameter during initialization.
184: 3.  We created a `Session`.
185: 4.  Crucially, we `mount`ed our `adapter_with_retries` specifically to the base URL of the flaky API (`https://flaky-api.example.com/`).
186: 5.  When `session.get(api_endpoint)` is called, the Session sees that the URL starts with the mounted prefix, so it uses our `adapter_with_retries`. If the server returns a `503` error, this adapter (using the `Retry` object) will automatically wait and try again, up to 5 times.
187: 6.  Requests to `https://httpbin.org` don't match the specific prefix, so they fall back to the default adapter mounted for `https://`, which has default retry behavior.
188: 
189: This allows fine-grained control over connection handling for different destinations.
190: 
191: ## How It Works Internally: The Session-Adapter Dance
192: 
193: Let's trace the steps when you call `session.get(url)`:
194: 
195: 1.  **`Session.request`:** Your `session.get(url, ...)` call ends up in the main `Session.request` method.
196: 2.  **Prepare Request:** `Session.request` creates a `Request` object and calls `self.prepare_request(req)` to turn it into a `PreparedRequest`, merging session-level settings like headers and cookies (as seen in [Chapter 3: Session](03_session.md)).
197: 3.  **Merge Environment Settings:** `Session.request` calls `self.merge_environment_settings(...)` to figure out final settings for proxies, SSL verification (`verify`), etc.
198: 4.  **`Session.send`:** The prepared request (`prep`) and final settings (`send_kwargs`) are passed to `self.send(prep, **send_kwargs)`.
199: 5.  **`get_adapter`:** Inside `Session.send`, the first crucial step is `adapter = self.get_adapter(url=request.url)`. This method looks through the `self.adapters` dictionary (which is ordered from longest prefix to shortest) and returns the *first* adapter whose mounted prefix matches the beginning of the request's URL.
200: 6.  **`adapter.send`:** The `Session` then calls the `send` method *on the chosen adapter*: `r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)`. **This is the handover!** The Session delegates the actual sending to the Transport Adapter.
201: 7.  **Adapter Does the Work:** The adapter (e.g., `HTTPAdapter`) takes over.
202:     *   It interacts with its `urllib3.PoolManager` to get a connection from the pool (or create one).
203:     *   It configures SSL/TLS context based on `verify` and `cert` parameters.
204:     *   It uses `urllib3` to send the actual HTTP request bytes over the network.
205:     *   It applies retry logic (using the `Retry` object if configured) if `urllib3` reports certain connection errors or status codes.
206:     *   It receives the raw HTTP response bytes from `urllib3`.
207: 8.  **`adapter.build_response`:** The adapter takes the raw response data from `urllib3` and constructs a `requests.Response` object using its `build_response(request, raw_urllib3_response)` method. This involves parsing status codes, headers, and making the response body available.
208: 9.  **Return Response:** The `adapter.send` method returns the fully formed `Response` object back to the `Session.send` method.
209: 10. **Post-Processing:** `Session.send` does some final steps, like extracting cookies from the response into the session's [Cookie Jar](04_cookie_jar.md) and handling redirects (which might involve calling `send` again).
210: 11. **Final Return:** The final `Response` object is returned to your original `session.get(url)` call.

382: 
383: The key idea is that the `Session` finds the right `Adapter` using `mount` prefixes, and then the `Adapter` uses `urllib3` to handle the low-level details of connection pooling, retries, and HTTP communication.
384: 
385: ## Other Use Cases
386: 
387: Besides custom retries, you might use Transport Adapters for:
388: 
389: *   **Custom SSL/TLS Contexts:** Create an `HTTPAdapter` and initialize its `PoolManager` with a custom `ssl.SSLContext` for fine-grained control over TLS versions, ciphers, or certificate verification logic.
390: *   **SOCKS Proxies:** While `requests` doesn't support SOCKS natively, you can install a third-party library (like `requests-socks`) which provides a `SOCKSAdapter` that you can mount onto a session.
391: *   **Testing:** You could create a custom adapter that doesn't actually make network requests but returns predefined responses, useful for testing your application without hitting real servers.
392: *   **Custom Protocols:** If you needed to interact with a non-HTTP protocol, you could theoretically write a custom `BaseAdapter` subclass to handle it.
393: 
394: ## Conclusion
395: 
396: You've learned about **Transport Adapters**, the pluggable backends that `requests` uses to handle the actual sending of requests and management of connections for different URL schemes (`http://`, `https://`, etc.).
397: 
398: *   You saw the default adapter is `HTTPAdapter`, which uses `urllib3` for connection pooling, retries, and SSL.
399: *   You learned how `Session` objects `mount` adapters to specific URL prefixes.
400: *   You practiced customizing retry behavior by creating a new `HTTPAdapter` with a `urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object and mounting it to a session.
401: *   You traced how a `Session` finds and delegates work to the appropriate adapter via `adapter.send`.
402: 
403: Transport Adapters give you powerful, low-level control over how `requests` interacts with the network, allowing you to tailor its behavior for specific needs.
404: 
405: Adapters let you customize *how* requests are sent. What if you want to simply *react* to a request being sent or a response being received, perhaps to log it or modify it slightly on the fly? `Requests` has another mechanism for that.

  8: # Chapter 8: The Hook System - Setting Up Checkpoints
  9: 
 10: In [Chapter 7: Transport Adapters](07_transport_adapters.md), we saw how to customize the low-level details of *how* requests are sent and connections are managed, like setting custom retry strategies. Transport Adapters give you control over the delivery mechanism itself.
 11: 
 12: But what if you don't need to change *how* the request is sent, but instead want to simply **react** when something happens during the process? For example, maybe you want to log every single response your application receives, or perhaps automatically add a timestamp to every request header just before it goes out (though this specific header example isn't currently supported by the default hooks).
 13: 
 14: ## The Problem: Reacting to Events
 15: 
 16: Imagine you're building an application that interacts with several different web services. For debugging or monitoring purposes, you want to keep a record of every response you get back – specifically, the URL you requested and the status code the server returned.
 17: 
 18: You could manually add `print()` statements after every single `requests.get()`, `s.post()`, etc., call throughout your code:
 19: 
 20: ```python
 21: # Manual logging (Repetitive!)
 22: response1 = s.get('https://api.service1.com/data')
 23: print(f"LOG: Got {response1.status_code} for {response1.url}")
 24: # ... process response1 ...
 25: 
 26: response2 = s.post('https://api.service2.com/action', data={'key': 'value'})
 27: print(f"LOG: Got {response2.status_code} for {response2.url}")
 28: # ... process response2 ...
 29: 
 30: response3 = s.get('https://api.service1.com/status')
 31: print(f"LOG: Got {response3.status_code} for {response3.url}")
 32: # ... process response3 ...
 33: ```
 34: 
 35: This quickly becomes tedious and error-prone. If you forget to add the logging line, you miss that record. If you want to change the log format, you have to change it everywhere. Isn't there a way to tell `requests` to automatically run your logging code *every time* it gets a response?
 36: 
 37: ## Meet the Hook System: Your Automated Checkpoints
 38: 
 39: Yes, there is! `Requests` provides a **Hook System** that lets you do just that.
 40: 
 41: Think of hooks like setting up **checkpoints** in the process of making a request and getting a response. When the process reaches a specific checkpoint, `requests` pauses briefly and calls any custom functions you've registered for that checkpoint.
 42: 
 43: **Analogy: Package Delivery Checkpoints** 📦
 44: 
 45: Imagine a package delivery process:
 46: 1.  Package picked up.
 47: 2.  Package arrives at sorting facility. -> **Checkpoint!** (Maybe run a function to scan the barcode).
 48: 3.  Package loaded onto delivery truck.
 49: 4.  Package delivered to recipient. -> **Checkpoint!** (Maybe run a function to get a signature).
 50: 
 51: The Hook System in `requests` works similarly. You can attach your own Python functions (called "hooks") to specific events (checkpoints).
 52: 
 53: Currently, the main event available is the **`response`** hook.
 54: *   **`response` Hook:** This hook runs *after* a response has been received from the server and the basic `Response` object has been built, but *before* that `Response` object is returned to your code that called `requests.get()` or `s.post()`.
 55: 
 56: ## Using the `response` Hook
 57: 
 58: Let's solve our logging problem using the `response` hook.
 59: 
 60: **Step 1: Define the Hook Function**
 61: 
 62: First, we need to write a Python function that will perform our logging action. This function needs to accept the `Response` object as its first argument. It can also accept optional keyword arguments (`**kwargs`), which `requests` might pass in (though for the `response` hook, the `Response` object is the main thing).
 63: 
 64: ```python
 65: # Our custom hook function for logging
 66: def log_response_details(response, *args, **kwargs):
 67:     """
 68:     This function will be called after each response.
 69:     It logs the request method, URL, and response status code.
 70:     """
 71:     # 'response' is the Response object just received
 72:     request_method = response.request.method # Get the method from the original request
 73:     url = response.url                     # Get the final URL
 74:     status_code = response.status_code       # Get the status code
 75: 
 76:     print(f"HOOK LOG: Received {status_code} for {request_method} request to {url}")
 77: 
 78:     # IMPORTANT: Hooks usually shouldn't return anything (or return None).
 79:     # If a hook returns a value, it REPLACES the data being processed.
 80:     # For the 'response' hook, returning a value would replace the Response object!
 81:     # Since we just want to log, we don't return anything.
 82: ```
 83: 
 84: **Explanation:**
 85: 
 86: *   The function `log_response_details` takes `response` as its first argument. This will be the `requests.Response` object.
 87: *   It also accepts `*args` and `**kwargs` to be flexible, even though we don't use them here.
 88: *   Inside the function, we access attributes of the `response` object (like `status_code`, `url`) and its associated request (`response.request.method`) to print our log message.
 89: *   Crucially, this function *doesn't return anything*. If it did return a value, that value would replace the original `response` object for any further processing or for the final return value of `s.get()`.
 90: 
 91: **Step 2: Register the Hook**
 92: 
 93: Now we need to tell `requests` to actually *use* our `log_response_details` function. We can register hooks in two main ways:
 94: 
 95: 1.  **On a `Session` Object:** If you register a hook on a [Session](03_session.md) object, it will be called for *every request* made using that session. This is perfect for our logging use case.
 96: 2.  **On a Single `Request`:** You can also attach hooks to an individual `Request` object before preparing it. This is less common but useful if you only want a hook to run for one specific request.
 97: 
 98: Let's register our hook on a `Session`:
 99: 
100: ```python
101: import requests
102: 
103: # (Paste the log_response_details function definition from above here)
104: def log_response_details(response, *args, **kwargs):
105:     request_method = response.request.method
106:     url = response.url
107:     status_code = response.status_code
108:     print(f"HOOK LOG: Received {status_code} for {request_method} request to {url}")
109: 
110: # Create a Session
111: s = requests.Session()
112: 
113: # Register the hook on the session
114: # Hooks are stored in a dictionary: session.hooks = {'event_name': [list_of_functions]}
115: # We add our function to the list for the 'response' event.
116: s.hooks['response'].append(log_response_details)
117: 
118: # Now, make some requests using the session
119: print("Making requests...")
120: response1 = s.get('https://httpbin.org/get')
121: print(f"  -> Main code received response 1 with status: {response1.status_code}")
122: 
123: response2 = s.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data={'id': '123'})
124: print(f"  -> Main code received response 2 with status: {response2.status_code}")
125: 
126: response3 = s.get('https://httpbin.org/status/404') # This will get a 404
127: print(f"  -> Main code received response 3 with status: {response3.status_code}")
128: ```
129: 
130: **Expected Output:**
131: 
132: ```
133: Making requests...
134: HOOK LOG: Received 200 for GET request to https://httpbin.org/get
135:   -> Main code received response 1 with status: 200
136: HOOK LOG: Received 200 for POST request to https://httpbin.org/post
137:   -> Main code received response 2 with status: 200
138: HOOK LOG: Received 404 for GET request to https://httpbin.org/status/404
139:   -> Main code received response 3 with status: 404
140: ```
141: 
142: **Explanation:**
143: 
144: 1.  `s = requests.Session()`: We created a session.
145: 2.  `s.hooks['response'].append(log_response_details)`: This is the key step. `s.hooks` is a dictionary where keys are event names (like `'response'`) and values are lists of functions to call for that event. We appended our logging function to the list for the `'response'` event.
146: 3.  When we called `s.get(...)` or `s.post(...)`, the following happened internally:
147:     *   The request was sent.
148:     *   The response was received.
149:     *   *Before* returning the response to our main code (`response1 = ...`), the `requests` Session checked its `hooks` dictionary for the `'response'` event.
150:     *   It found our `log_response_details` function and called it, passing the received `Response` object.
151:     *   Our hook function printed the log message.
152:     *   Since the hook returned `None`, the original `Response` object was then returned to our main code.
153: 4.  Notice how the "HOOK LOG" lines appear *before* the "Main code received response" lines, demonstrating that the hook runs after receiving the response but before the calling code gets it.
154: 
155: **Modifying the Response (Advanced)**
156: 
157: While our logging hook didn't return anything, a hook *can* modify the `Response` object it receives, or even return a completely different `Response` object.
158: 
159: ```python
160: def add_custom_header_hook(response, *args, **kwargs):
161:     """Adds a custom header to the received response."""
162:     print("HOOK: Adding X-Hook-Processed header...")
163:     response.headers['X-Hook-Processed'] = 'True'
164:     # We modified the response in-place, so we return None
165:     # to let requests continue using the modified response.
166:     return None
167: 
168: # Or, a hook that returns a *new* response (less common)
169: # def replace_response_hook(response, *args, **kwargs):
170: #     if response.status_code == 404:
171: #         print("HOOK: Replacing 404 response with a custom one!")
172: #         new_response = requests.Response()
173: #         new_response.status_code = 200
174: #         new_response.reason = "Found via Hook"
175: #         new_response._content = b"Content generated by hook!"
176: #         new_response.request = response.request # Keep original request link
177: #         return new_response # Return the NEW response
178: #     return None # Otherwise, keep the original response
179: ```
180: 
181: **Caution:** Modifying or replacing responses within hooks can be powerful but also confusing if not done carefully. For beginners, using hooks for actions like logging or metrics that don't change the response is often the safest starting point.
182: 
183: ## How It Works Internally
184: 
185: Where exactly does `requests` call these hooks? The `response` hook is triggered within the `Session.send()` method, after the underlying [Transport Adapter](07_transport_adapters.md) has returned a response, but before things like cookie persistence and redirect handling are fully completed for that specific response.
186: 
187: 1.  **`Session.send()` Called:** Your code calls `s.get()` or `s.post()`, which eventually calls `Session.send()`.
188: 2.  **Adapter Sends Request:** The session selects the appropriate [Transport Adapter](07_transport_adapters.md) (e.g., `HTTPAdapter`). The adapter sends the request and receives the raw response (`r = adapter.send(...)`).
189: 3.  **Dispatch Hook:** Right after the adapter returns the `Response` object `r`, `Session.send()` calls `dispatch_hook("response", hooks, r, **kwargs)`. `hooks` here refers to the merged hooks from the `Request` and the `Session`.
190: 4.  **`dispatch_hook()` Executes:** This helper function (from `requests.hooks`) looks up the list of functions registered for the `"response"` event. It iterates through this list, calling each hook function (like our `log_response_details`) one by one, passing the `Response` object (`r`) to it.
191: 5.  **Hook Modifies/Replaces (Optional):** If a hook function returns a value, `dispatch_hook` updates `r` to be that new value. This allows hooks later in the list (or the main code) to see the modified response.
192: 6.  **Further Processing:** After `dispatch_hook` returns the (potentially modified) `Response` object `r`, `Session.send()` continues with other tasks like extracting cookies from `r` into the session's jar and handling redirects (which might involve sending another request).
193: 7.  **Return Response:** Finally, the `Response` object is returned to your original calling code.

326: #       into the PreparedRequest.hooks dictionary.
327: ```
328: 
329: The `dispatch_hook` function is the core mechanism that allows `requests` to call your custom functions at the designated `"response"` checkpoint within `Session.send`.
330: 
331: ## Conclusion
332: 
333: You've learned about the **Hook System** in `requests`, a way to register custom callback functions that run at specific points in the request-response lifecycle.
334: 
335: *   You understood the motivation: automating actions like logging without cluttering your main code.
336: *   You focused on the primary hook: **`response`**, which runs after a response is received but before it's returned to the caller.
337: *   You saw how to define a hook function (accepting the `response` object) and register it on a `Session` (using `session.hooks`) to apply it globally, or potentially on a single `Request`.
338: *   You implemented a practical example: logging response details automatically.
339: *   You got a glimpse into how hooks *can* modify responses (use with care!).
340: *   You learned that internally, the `dispatch_hook` function is called by `Session.send` to execute your registered hook functions.
341: 
342: The Hook System provides a clean way to plug into the `requests` workflow and add custom behavior or monitoring without modifying the library itself.
343: 
344: This concludes our journey through the core abstractions of the `requests` library! From the simple [Functional API](01_functional_api.md) to the powerful [Session](03_session.md) object, managing [Cookies](04_cookie_jar.md), handling [Authentication](05_authentication_handlers.md), dealing with [Exceptions](06_exception_hierarchy.md), customizing connections with [Transport Adapters](07_transport_adapters.md), and reacting to events with the Hook System, you now have a solid foundation for using `requests` effectively in your Python projects. Happy requesting!

12: Requests<sup>[View Repo](https://github.com/psf/requests/tree/0e322af87745eff34caffe4df68456ebc20d9068/src/requests)</sup> is a Python library that makes sending *HTTP requests* incredibly simple.
13: Instead of dealing with complex details, you can use straightforward functions (like `requests.get()`) or **Session objects** to interact with web services.
14: It automatically handles things like *cookies*, *redirects*, *authentication*, and connection pooling, returning easy-to-use **Response objects** with all the server's data.

  8: # Chapter 1: The MultiStepAgent - Your Task Orchestrator
  9: 
 10: Welcome to the SmolaAgents library! If you're looking to build smart AI agents that can tackle complex problems, you're in the right place.
 11: 
 12: Imagine you have a complex task, like "Research the pros and cons of electric cars and write a short summary." A single request to a simple AI might not be enough. It needs to search the web, read different articles, synthesize the information, and then write the summary. How does an AI manage such a multi-step process?
 13: 
 14: This is where the `MultiStepAgent` comes in! Think of it as the **project manager** for your AI task. It doesn't do all the work itself, but it directs the process, decides what needs to happen next, uses specialized helpers (called "Tools"), and keeps track of everything until the task is done.
 15: 
 16: ## The Core Idea: Think, Act, Observe
 17: 
 18: The `MultiStepAgent` works by following a cycle, much like how humans solve problems. This cycle is often called **ReAct** (Reasoning and Acting):
 19: 
 20: 1.  **Think (Reason):** The agent looks at the main goal (the task) and where it currently is in the process. Based on this, it thinks about what the *very next step* should be to get closer to the goal. Should it search for information? Should it perform a calculation? Should it write something down?
 21: 2.  **Act:** The agent performs the action it decided on. This usually involves using a specific **[Tool](03_tool.md)** (like a web search tool, a calculator, or a code execution tool) or generating text/code.
 22: 3.  **Observe:** The agent looks at the result of its action. What did the web search return? What was the output of the code? This new information ("observation") helps it decide what to do in the next "Think" phase.
 23: 
 24: The agent repeats this **Think -> Act -> Observe** cycle over and over, step-by-step, until it believes it has fully completed the task and has a final answer.
 25: 
 26: ## How It Works: Coordinating the Team
 27: 
 28: The `MultiStepAgent` doesn't work in isolation. It coordinates several key components:
 29: 
 30: 1.  **The Language Model (LLM):** This is the "brain" of the operation. The agent consults the LLM during the "Think" phase. It sends the current task, the history of actions and observations, and asks the LLM, "What should I do next?". We'll explore this more in [Chapter 2: Model Interface](02_model_interface.md).
 31: 2.  **Tools:** These are specialized functions the agent can use to perform actions. Examples include searching the web, running Python code, fetching weather information, or even generating images. The agent chooses which tool to use (if any) during the "Act" phase based on the LLM's suggestion. Learn all about them in [Chapter 3: Tool](03_tool.md).
 32: 3.  **Memory:** This is like the agent's notepad. It keeps track of the original task, the plan (if any), every action taken, and every observation received. This history is crucial for the agent (and the LLM) to understand the progress and decide the next steps. We'll dive into this in [Chapter 4: AgentMemory](04_agentmemory.md).
 33: 
 34: ## A Simple Example: Getting the Capital and Weather
 35: 
 36: Let's revisit our simple task: **"What is the capital of France, and what is its current weather?"**
 37: 
 38: Here's how a `MultiStepAgent`, equipped with a `search` tool and a `weather` tool, might handle it:
 39: 
 40: 1.  **Step 1 (Think):** The agent sees the task. It realizes it needs two pieces of information: the capital and the weather *for* that capital. First, it needs the capital.
 41: 2.  **Step 1 (Act):** It decides to use the `search` tool with the query "Capital of France".
 42: 3.  **Step 1 (Observe):** The `search` tool returns "Paris". The agent stores "Capital is Paris" in its [Memory](04_agentmemory.md).
 43: 4.  **Step 2 (Think):** The agent checks its memory. It has the capital (Paris) but still needs the weather.
 44: 5.  **Step 2 (Act):** It decides to use the `weather` tool with the location "Paris".
 45: 6.  **Step 2 (Observe):** The `weather` tool returns something like "Sunny, 25°C". The agent stores this observation in its [Memory](04_agentmemory.md).
 46: 7.  **Step 3 (Think):** The agent reviews its memory. It now has both the capital ("Paris") and the weather ("Sunny, 25°C"). It has all the information needed to answer the original task.
 47: 8.  **Step 3 (Act):** It decides it's finished and uses a special built-in tool called `final_answer` to provide the complete result.
 48: 9.  **Step 3 (Observe):** The `final_answer` tool packages the result, like "The capital of France is Paris, and the current weather there is Sunny, 25°C." The cycle ends.
 49: 
 50: ## Let's See Some Code (Basic Setup)
 51: 
 52: Okay, enough theory! How does this look in code? Setting up a basic `MultiStepAgent` involves giving it its "brain" (the model) and its "helpers" (the tools).
 53: 
 54: ```python
 55: # --- File: basic_agent.py ---
 56: # Import necessary components (we'll explain these more in later chapters!)
 57: from smolagents import MultiStepAgent
 58: from smolagents.models import LiteLLMModel # A simple way to use various LLMs
 59: from smolagents.tools import SearchTool, WeatherTool # Example Tools
 60: 
 61: # 1. Define the tools the agent can use
 62: # These are like specialized workers the agent can call upon.
 63: search_tool = SearchTool()   # A tool to search the web (details in Chapter 3)
 64: weather_tool = WeatherTool() # A tool to get weather info (details in Chapter 3)
 65: # Note: Real tools might need API keys or setup!
 66: 
 67: # 2. Choose a language model (the "brain")
 68: # We'll use LiteLLMModel here, connecting to a capable model.
 69: # Make sure you have 'litellm' installed: pip install litellm
 70: llm = LiteLLMModel(model_id="gpt-3.5-turbo") # Needs an API key set up
 71: # We'll cover models properly in Chapter 2
 72: 
 73: # 3. Create the MultiStepAgent instance
 74: # We pass the brain (llm) and the helpers (tools)
 75: agent = MultiStepAgent(
 76:     model=llm,
 77:     tools=[search_tool, weather_tool]
 78:     # By default, a 'final_answer' tool is always added.
 79: )
 80: 
 81: print("Agent created!")
 82: 
 83: # 4. Give the agent a task!
 84: task = "What is the capital of France, and what is its current weather?"
 85: print(f"Running agent with task: '{task}'")
 86: 
 87: # The agent will now start its Think-Act-Observe cycle...
 88: final_answer = agent.run(task)
 89: 
 90: # ... and eventually return the final result.
 91: print("-" * 20)
 92: print(f"Final Answer received: {final_answer}")
 93: ```
 94: 
 95: **Explanation:**
 96: 
 97: 1.  **Import:** We bring in `MultiStepAgent` and placeholders for a model and tools.
 98: 2.  **Tools:** We create instances of the tools our agent might need (`SearchTool`, `WeatherTool`). How tools work is covered in [Chapter 3: Tool](03_tool.md).
 99: 3.  **Model:** We set up the language model (`LiteLLMModel`) that will power the agent's thinking. More on models in [Chapter 2: Model Interface](02_model_interface.md).
100: 4.  **Agent Creation:** We initialize `MultiStepAgent`, telling it which `model` to use for thinking and which `tools` are available for acting.
101: 5.  **Run Task:** We call the `agent.run()` method with our specific `task`. This kicks off the Think-Act-Observe cycle.
102: 6.  **Output:** The `run` method continues executing steps until the `final_answer` tool is called or a limit is reached. It then returns the content provided to `final_answer`.
103: 
104: *(Note: Running the code above requires setting up API keys for the chosen LLM and potentially the tools).*
105: 
106: ## Under the Hood: The `run` Process
107: 
108: When you call `agent.run(task)`, a sequence of internal steps takes place:
109: 
110: 1.  **Initialization:** The agent receives the `task` and stores it in its [AgentMemory](04_agentmemory.md). The step counter is reset.
111: 2.  **Loop:** The agent enters the main Think-Act-Observe loop. This loop continues until a final answer is produced or the maximum number of steps (`max_steps`) is reached.
112: 3.  **Prepare Input:** Inside the loop, the agent gathers its history (task, previous actions, observations) from [AgentMemory](04_agentmemory.md) using `write_memory_to_messages`.
113: 4.  **Think (Call Model):** It sends this history to the [Model](02_model_interface.md) (e.g., `self.model(messages)`), asking for the next action (which tool to call and with what arguments, or if it should use `final_answer`).
114: 5.  **Store Thought:** The model's response (the thought process and the intended action) is recorded in the current step's data within [AgentMemory](04_agentmemory.md).
115: 6.  **Act (Execute Tool/Code):**
116:     *   The agent parses the model's response to identify the action (e.g., call `search` with "Capital of France").
117:     *   If it's a [Tool](03_tool.md) call, it executes the tool (e.g., `search_tool("Capital of France")`).
118:     *   If it's the `final_answer` tool, it prepares to exit the loop.
119:     *   *(Note: Different agent types handle this 'Act' phase differently. We'll see this in [Chapter 7: AgentType](07_agenttype.md). For instance, a `CodeAgent` generates and runs code here.)*
120: 7.  **Observe (Get Result):** The result from the tool execution (or code execution) is captured as the "observation".
121: 8.  **Store Observation:** This observation (e.g., "Paris") is recorded in the current step's data in [AgentMemory](04_agentmemory.md).
122: 9.  **Repeat:** The loop goes back to step 3, using the new observation as part of the history for the next "Think" phase.
123: 10. **Finish:** Once the `final_answer` tool is called, the loop breaks, and the value passed to `final_answer` is returned by the `run` method. If `max_steps` is reached without a final answer, an error or a fallback answer might occur.

163: ## Diving Deeper (Code References)
164: 
165: Let's peek at some relevant code snippets from `agents.py` to see how this is implemented (simplified for clarity):
166: 
167: *   **Initialization (`__init__`)**: Stores the essential components.
168:     ```python
169:     # --- File: agents.py (Simplified __init__) ---
170:     class MultiStepAgent:
171:         def __init__(
172:             self,
173:             tools: List[Tool], # List of available tools
174:             model: Callable,    # The language model function
175:             max_steps: int = 20, # Max cycles allowed
176:             # ... other parameters like memory, prompts, etc.
177:         ):
178:             self.model = model
179:             self.tools = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}
180:             # Add the essential final_answer tool
181:             self.tools.setdefault("final_answer", FinalAnswerTool())
182:             self.max_steps = max_steps
183:             self.memory = AgentMemory(...) # Initialize memory
184:             # ... setup logging, etc.
185:     ```
186: 
187: *   **Starting the process (`run`)**: Sets up the task and calls the internal loop.
188:     ```python
189:     # --- File: agents.py (Simplified run) ---
190:     class MultiStepAgent:
191:         def run(self, task: str, ...):
192:             self.task = task
193:             # ... maybe handle additional arguments ...
194: 
195:             # Reset memory if needed
196:             self.memory.reset()
197:             self.memory.steps.append(TaskStep(task=self.task)) # Record the task
198: 
199:             # Start the internal execution loop
200:             # The deque gets the *last* item yielded, which is the final answer
201:             return deque(self._run(task=self.task, max_steps=self.max_steps), maxlen=1)[0].final_answer
202:     ```
203: 
204: *   **The Core Loop (`_run`)**: Implements the Think-Act-Observe cycle.
205:     ```python
206:     # --- File: agents.py (Simplified _run) ---
207:     class MultiStepAgent:
208:         def _run(self, task: str, max_steps: int, ...) -> Generator:
209:             final_answer = None
210:             self.step_number = 1
211:             while final_answer is None and self.step_number <= max_steps:
212:                 action_step = self._create_action_step(...) # Prepare memory for this step
213: 
214:                 try:
215:                     # This is where the agent type decides how to act
216:                     # (e.g., call LLM, parse, execute tool/code)
217:                     final_answer = self._execute_step(task, action_step)
218:                 except AgentError as e:
219:                     action_step.error = e # Record errors
220:                 finally:
221:                     self._finalize_step(action_step, ...) # Record timing, etc.
222:                     self.memory.steps.append(action_step) # Save step to memory
223:                     yield action_step # Yield step details (for streaming)
224:                     self.step_number += 1
225: 
226:             if final_answer is None:
227:                 # Handle reaching max steps
228:                 ...
229:             yield FinalAnswerStep(handle_agent_output_types(final_answer)) # Yield final answer
230:     ```
231: 
232: *   **Executing a Step (`_execute_step`)**: This calls the `step` method which specific agent types (like `CodeAgent` or `ToolCallingAgent`) implement differently.
233:     ```python
234:     # --- File: agents.py (Simplified _execute_step) ---
235:     class MultiStepAgent:
236:         def _execute_step(self, task: str, memory_step: ActionStep) -> Union[None, Any]:
237:             # Calls the specific logic for the agent type
238:             # This method will interact with the model, tools, memory
239:             final_answer = self.step(memory_step)
240:             # ... (optional checks on final answer) ...
241:             return final_answer
242: 
243:         # step() is implemented by subclasses like CodeAgent or ToolCallingAgent
244:         def step(self, memory_step: ActionStep) -> Union[None, Any]:
245:             raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement the step method.")
246:     ```
247: 
248: These snippets show how `MultiStepAgent` orchestrates the process, relying on its `model`, `tools`, and `memory`, and delegating the specific "how-to-act" logic to subclasses via the `step` method (more on this in [Chapter 7: AgentType](07_agenttype.md)).
249: 
250: ## Conclusion
251: 
252: The `MultiStepAgent` is the heart of the SmolaAgents library. It provides the framework for agents to tackle complex tasks by breaking them down into a **Think -> Act -> Observe** cycle. It acts as the central coordinator, managing interactions between the language model (the brain), the tools (the specialized helpers), and the memory (the notepad).
253: 
254: You've learned:
255: 
256: *   Why `MultiStepAgent` is needed for tasks requiring multiple steps.
257: *   The core ReAct cycle: Think, Act, Observe.
258: *   How it coordinates the Model, Tools, and Memory.
259: *   Seen a basic code example of setting up and running an agent.
260: *   Gotten a glimpse into the internal `run` process.
261: 
262: Now that we understand the orchestrator, let's move on to understand the "brain" it relies on.

  8: # Chapter 2: Model Interface - Your Agent's Universal Translator
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 1: The MultiStepAgent - Your Task Orchestrator](01_multistepagent.md), we met the `MultiStepAgent`, our AI project manager. We learned that it follows a "Think -> Act -> Observe" cycle to solve tasks. A crucial part of the "Think" phase is consulting its "brain" – a Large Language Model (LLM).
 11: 
 12: But wait... there are so many different LLMs out there! OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, open-source models you can run locally like Llama or Mistral... How can our agent talk to all of them without needing completely different code for each one?
 13: 
 14: This is where the **Model Interface** comes in!
 15: 
 16: ## The Problem: Too Many Remotes!
 17: 
 18: Imagine you have several TVs at home, each from a different brand (Sony, Samsung, LG). Each TV comes with its own specific remote control. To watch TV, you need to find the *right* remote and know *its specific buttons*. It's a hassle!
 19: 
 20: ![Different TV Remotes](https://img.icons8.com/cotton/64/000000/remote-control.png) ![Different TV Remotes](https://img.icons8.com/fluency/48/000000/remote-control.png) ![Different TV Remotes](https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/remote-control.png)
 21: 
 22: Different LLMs are like those different TVs. Each has its own way of being "controlled" – its own API (Application Programming Interface) or library with specific functions, required inputs, and ways of giving back answers. If our `MultiStepAgent` had to learn the specific "remote control commands" for every possible LLM, our code would become very complicated very quickly!
 23: 
 24: ## The Solution: The Universal Remote (Model Interface)
 25: 
 26: Wouldn't it be great if you had *one* universal remote that could control *all* your TVs? You'd just press "Power", "Volume Up", or "Channel Down", and the universal remote would figure out how to send the correct signal to whichever TV you're using.
 27: 
 28: ![Universal Remote](https://img.icons8.com/office/80/000000/remote-control.png)  -> Controls -> ![Sony TV](https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/tv.png) ![Samsung TV](https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/tv-on.png) ![LG TV](https://img.icons8.com/emoji/48/000000/television.png)
 29: 
 30: The **Model Interface** in `SmolaAgents` is exactly like that universal remote.
 31: 
 32: *   It's an **abstraction layer**: a way to hide the complicated details.
 33: *   It provides a **consistent way** for the `MultiStepAgent` to talk to *any* supported LLM.
 34: *   It handles the "translation" behind the scenes:
 35:     *   Taking the agent's request (like "What should I do next?").
 36:     *   Formatting it correctly for the specific LLM being used.
 37:     *   Sending the request (making the API call or running the local model).
 38:     *   Receiving the LLM's raw response.
 39:     *   Parsing that response back into a standard format the agent understands (including things like requests to use [Tools](03_tool.md)).
 40: 
 41: So, the `MultiStepAgent` only needs to learn how to use the *one* universal remote (the Model Interface), not the specific commands for every LLM "TV".
 42: 
 43: ## How It Works: The Standard `__call__`
 44: 
 45: The magic of the Model Interface lies in its simplicity from the agent's perspective. All Model Interfaces in `SmolaAgents` work the same way: you "call" them like a function, passing in the conversation history.
 46: 
 47: Think of it like pressing the main button on our universal remote.
 48: 
 49: 1.  **Input:** The agent gives the Model Interface a list of messages representing the conversation so far. This usually includes the system prompt (instructions for the LLM), the user's task, and any previous "Think -> Act -> Observe" steps stored in [AgentMemory](04_agentmemory.md). Each message typically has a `role` (like `user`, `assistant`, or `system`) and `content`.
 50: 2.  **Processing (Behind the Scenes):** The *specific* Model Interface (e.g., one for OpenAI, one for local models) takes this standard list of messages and:
 51:     *   Connects to the correct LLM (using API keys, loading a local model, etc.).
 52:     *   Formats the messages exactly how that LLM expects them.
 53:     *   Sends the request.
 54:     *   Waits for the LLM to generate a response.
 55:     *   Gets the response back.
 56: 3.  **Output:** It translates the LLM's raw response back into a standard `ChatMessage` object. This object contains the LLM's text response and, importantly, might include structured information if the LLM decided the agent should use a [Tool](03_tool.md). The agent knows exactly how to read this `ChatMessage`.
 57: 
 58: ## Using a Model Interface
 59: 
 60: Let's see how you'd actually *use* one. `SmolaAgents` comes with several built-in Model Interfaces. A very useful one is `LiteLLMModel`, which uses the `litellm` library to connect to hundreds of different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Azure, local models via Ollama, etc.) with minimal code changes!
 61: 
 62: **Step 1: Choose and Initialize Your Model Interface**
 63: 
 64: First, you decide which LLM you want your agent to use. Then, you create an instance of the corresponding Model Interface.
 65: 
 66: ```python
 67: # --- File: choose_model.py ---
 68: # Import the model interface you want to use
 69: from smolagents.models import LiteLLMModel
 70: # (You might need to install litellm first: pip install smolagents[litellm])
 71: 
 72: # Choose the specific LLM model ID that litellm supports
 73: # Example: OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo
 74: # Requires setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable!
 75: model_id = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
 76: 
 77: # Create an instance of the Model Interface
 78: # This object is our "universal remote" configured for GPT-3.5
 79: llm = LiteLLMModel(model_id=model_id)
 80: 
 81: print(f"Model Interface created for: {model_id}")
 82: # Example Output: Model Interface created for: gpt-3.5-turbo
 83: ```
 84: 
 85: **Explanation:**
 86: *   We import `LiteLLMModel`.
 87: *   We specify the `model_id` we want to use (here, `"gpt-3.5-turbo"`). `litellm` knows how to talk to this model if the necessary API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) is available in your environment.
 88: *   We create the `llm` object. This object now knows how to communicate with GPT-3.5 Turbo via the `litellm` library, but it presents a standard interface to the rest of our code.
 89: 
 90: **Step 2: Give the Model to the Agent**
 91: 
 92: Remember from Chapter 1 how we created the `MultiStepAgent`? We simply pass our `llm` object (the configured universal remote) to it.
 93: 
 94: ```python
 95: # --- Continued from choose_model.py ---
 96: # (Requires imports from Chapter 1: MultiStepAgent, SearchTool, etc.)
 97: from smolagents import MultiStepAgent
 98: from smolagents.tools import SearchTool # Example Tool
 99: 
100: # Define some tools (details in Chapter 3)
101: search_tool = SearchTool()
102: tools = [search_tool]
103: 
104: # Create the agent, giving it the model interface instance
105: agent = MultiStepAgent(
106:     model=llm,  # <= Here's where we plug in our "universal remote"!
107:     tools=tools
108: )
109: 
110: print("MultiStepAgent created and configured with the model!")
111: # Example Output: MultiStepAgent created and configured with the model!
112: ```
113: 
114: **Explanation:**
115: *   The `MultiStepAgent` doesn't need to know it's talking to GPT-3.5 Turbo specifically. It just knows it has a `model` object that it can call.
116: 
117: **Step 3: How the Agent Uses the Model (Simplified)**
118: 
119: Inside its "Think" phase, the agent prepares the conversation history and calls the model:
120: 
121: ```python
122: # --- Simplified view of what happens inside the agent ---
123: from smolagents.models import ChatMessage, MessageRole
124: 
125: # Agent prepares messages (example)
126: messages_for_llm = [
127:     {"role": MessageRole.SYSTEM, "content": "You are a helpful agent. Decide the next step."},
128:     {"role": MessageRole.USER, "content": "Task: What is the capital of France?"},
129:     # ... potentially previous steps ...
130: ]
131: 
132: # Agent calls the model using the standard interface
133: # This is like pressing the main button on the universal remote
134: print("Agent asking model: What should I do next?")
135: response: ChatMessage = agent.model(messages_for_llm) # agent.model refers to our 'llm' instance
136: 
137: # Agent gets a standard response back
138: print(f"Model suggested action (simplified): {response.content}")
139: # Example Output (will vary):
140: # Agent asking model: What should I do next?
141: # Model suggested action (simplified): Thought: I need to find the capital of France. I can use the search tool.
142: # Action:
143: # ```json
144: # {
145: #  "action": "search",
146: #  "action_input": "Capital of France"
147: # }
148: # ```
149: ```
150: 
151: **Explanation:**
152: *   The agent prepares a list of `messages_for_llm`.
153: *   It simply calls `agent.model(...)` which executes `llm(messages_for_llm)`.
154: *   The `LiteLLMModel` (`llm`) handles talking to the actual OpenAI API.
155: *   The agent receives a `ChatMessage` object, which it knows how to parse to find the next action (like using the `search` tool, as suggested in the example output).
156: 
157: ## Under the Hood: How the "Universal Remote" Works
158: 
159: Let's peek behind the curtain. What happens when the agent calls `model(messages)`?
160: 
161: **Conceptual Steps:**
162: 
163: 1.  **Receive Request:** The specific Model Interface (e.g., `LiteLLMModel`) gets the standard list of messages from the agent.
164: 2.  **Prepare Backend Request:** It looks at its own configuration (e.g., `model_id="gpt-3.5-turbo"`, API key) and translates the standard messages into the specific format the target LLM backend (e.g., the OpenAI API) requires. This might involve changing role names, structuring the data differently, etc.
165: 3.  **Send to Backend:** It makes the actual network call to the LLM's API endpoint or runs the command to invoke a local model.
166: 4.  **Receive Backend Response:** It gets the raw response back from the LLM (often as JSON or plain text).
167: 5.  **Parse Response:** It parses this raw response, extracting the generated text and any structured data (like tool calls).
168: 6.  **Return Standard Response:** It packages this information into a standard `ChatMessage` object and returns it to the agent.
169: 
170: **Diagram:**
171: 
172: Here's a simplified sequence diagram showing the flow:
173: 
174: ```mermaid
175: sequenceDiagram
176:     participant Agent as MultiStepAgent
177:     participant ModelI as Model Interface (e.g., LiteLLMModel)
178:     participant Backend as Specific LLM API/Library (e.g., OpenAI)
179: 
180:     Agent->>ModelI: call(standard_messages)
181:     ModelI->>ModelI: Translate messages to backend format
182:     ModelI->>Backend: Send API Request (formatted messages, API key)
183:     Backend-->>ModelI: Receive API Response (raw JSON/text)
184:     ModelI->>ModelI: Parse raw response into ChatMessage
185:     ModelI-->>Agent: Return ChatMessage object
186: ```
187: 
188: **Code Glimpse (Simplified):**
189: 
190: Let's look at `models.py` where these interfaces are defined.
191: 
192: *   **Base Class (`Model`):** Defines the common structure, including the `__call__` method that all specific interfaces must implement.
193:     ```python
194:     # --- File: models.py (Simplified Model base class) ---
195:     from typing import List, Dict, Optional
196:     from .tools import Tool # Reference to Tool concept
197: 
198:     @dataclass
199:     class ChatMessage: # Simplified representation of the standard response
200:         role: str
201:         content: Optional[str] = None
202:         tool_calls: Optional[List[dict]] = None # For tool usage (Chapter 3)
203:         # ... other fields ...
204: 
205:     class Model:
206:         def __init__(self, **kwargs):
207:             self.kwargs = kwargs # Stores model-specific settings

253:             )

255:             # 2. Call the actual backend via litellm
256:             # This hides the complexity of different API calls!
257:             response = litellm.completion(**completion_kwargs)
258: 
259:             # 3. Parse the response into our standard ChatMessage
260:             # (Simplified - actual parsing involves more details)

265:                 tool_calls=raw_message.tool_calls # If the LLM requested a tool
266:             )
267:             # ... store token counts, raw response etc. ...
268:             return chat_message
269:     ```
270: 
271: **Explanation:**
272: *   The `Model` class defines the contract (the `__call__` method).
273: *   `LiteLLMModel` fulfills this contract. Its `__call__` method uses `_prepare_completion_kwargs` to format the request suitable for `litellm`.
274: *   The core work happens in `litellm.completion(...)`, which connects to the actual LLM service (like OpenAI).
275: *   The result is then parsed back into the standard `ChatMessage` format.
276: 
277: The beauty is that the `MultiStepAgent` only ever interacts with the `__call__` method, regardless of whether it's using `LiteLLMModel`, `TransformersModel` (for local models), or another interface.
278: 
279: ## Conclusion
280: 
281: The Model Interface is a vital piece of the `SmolaAgents` puzzle. It acts as a universal translator or remote control, allowing your `MultiStepAgent` to seamlessly communicate with a wide variety of Large Language Models without getting bogged down in the specific details of each one.
282: 
283: You've learned:
284: 
285: *   Why a Model Interface is needed to handle diverse LLMs.
286: *   The "universal remote" analogy.
287: *   How the standard `__call__` method provides a consistent way for the agent to interact with the model.
288: *   How to choose, initialize, and provide a Model Interface (`LiteLLMModel` example) to your `MultiStepAgent`.
289: *   A glimpse into the internal process: translating requests, calling the backend LLM, and parsing responses.
290: 
291: Now that our agent has a brain (`MultiStepAgent`) and a way to talk to it (`Model Interface`), how does it actually *do* things based on the LLM's suggestions? How does it search the web, run code, or perform other actions? That's where our next component comes in!

  8: # Chapter 3: Tool - Giving Your Agent Superpowers
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 2: Model Interface](02_model_interface.md), we learned how our `MultiStepAgent` uses a "universal remote" (the Model Interface) to talk to its LLM "brain". The LLM thinks and suggests what the agent should do next.
 11: 
 12: But how does the agent actually *do* things? If the LLM suggests "Search the web for the capital of France," how does the agent perform the search? It can't just magically type into Google!
 13: 
 14: This is where **Tools** come in. They are the agent's hands and specialized equipment, allowing it to interact with the world beyond just generating text.
 15: 
 16: ## The Problem: An Agent Trapped in its Mind
 17: 
 18: Imagine a brilliant chef who only knows recipes but is locked in an empty room. They can tell you exactly how to make a perfect soufflé, step-by-step, but they can't actually *do* any of it. They have no ingredients, no oven, no whisk, no bowls. They're stuck!
 19: 
 20: ![Chef Thinking](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/cook-male--v1.png) 🤔 -> 📝 Recipe (Think)
 21: 
 22: An agent without tools is like that chef. The LLM brain can reason and plan ("I need to search the web"), but the agent itself has no way to execute that plan ("How do I *actually* search?").
 23: 
 24: ## The Solution: The Agent's Toolbox
 25: 
 26: Tools are specific capabilities we give to our agent. Think of them like the utensils and appliances in a kitchen drawer:
 27: 
 28: *   **Peeler:** Used for peeling vegetables.
 29: *   **Whisk:** Used for mixing ingredients.
 30: *   **Oven:** Used for baking.
 31: *   **Search Engine Tool:** Used for searching the web.
 32: *   **Calculator Tool:** Used for performing calculations.
 33: *   **Code Execution Tool:** Used for running computer code.
 34: 
 35: ![Toolbox](https://img.icons8.com/plasticine/100/toolbox.png) -> 🔎 Search, 💻 Code Runner, ☁️ Weather API
 36: 
 37: Each tool is a reusable function that the agent can call upon to perform a specific action. The agent acts like the chef, looking at the next step in the recipe (the LLM's suggestion) and picking the right tool from its toolbox.
 38: 
 39: ## What Makes a Tool?
 40: 
 41: Every tool in `SmolaAgents` needs a few key pieces of information so the agent (and the LLM helping it) can understand it:
 42: 
 43: 1.  **`name`**: A short, descriptive name for the tool (e.g., `web_search`, `calculator`). This is how the agent identifies which tool to use.
 44: 2.  **`description`**: A clear explanation of what the tool does, what it's good for, and what information it needs. This helps the LLM decide *when* to suggest using this tool. Example: *"Performs a web search using DuckDuckGo and returns the top results."*
 45: 3.  **`inputs`**: Defines what information the tool needs to do its job. This is like specifying that a peeler needs a vegetable, or a calculator needs numbers and an operation. It's defined as a dictionary where keys are argument names and values describe the type and purpose. Example: `{"query": {"type": "string", "description": "The search query"}}`.
 46: 4.  **`output_type`**: Describes the type of result the tool will return (e.g., `string`, `number`, `image`).
 47: 5.  **`forward` method**: This is the actual Python code that gets executed when the tool is used. It takes the defined `inputs` as arguments and performs the tool's action, returning the result.
 48: 
 49: ## Creating Your First Tool: The `GreetingTool`
 50: 
 51: Let's build a very simple tool. Imagine we want our agent to be able to greet someone by name.
 52: 
 53: We'll create a `GreetingTool` by inheriting from the base `Tool` class provided by `SmolaAgents`.
 54: 
 55: ```python
 56: # --- File: simple_tools.py ---
 57: from smolagents import Tool # Import the base class
 58: 
 59: class GreetingTool(Tool):
 60:     """A simple tool that generates a greeting."""
 61: 
 62:     # 1. Give it a unique name
 63:     name: str = "greet_person"
 64: 
 65:     # 2. Describe what it does clearly
 66:     description: str = "Greets a person by their name."
 67: 
 68:     # 3. Define the inputs it needs
 69:     # It needs one input: the 'name' of the person, which should be a string.
 70:     inputs: dict = {
 71:         "name": {
 72:             "type": "string",
 73:             "description": "The name of the person to greet."
 74:         }
 75:     }
 76: 
 77:     # 4. Specify the type of the output
 78:     # It will return the greeting as a string.
 79:     output_type: str = "string"
 80: 
 81:     # 5. Implement the action in the 'forward' method
 82:     def forward(self, name: str) -> str:
 83:         """The actual code that runs when the tool is called."""
 84:         print(f"--- GreetingTool activated with name: {name} ---")
 85:         greeting = f"Hello, {name}! Nice to meet you."
 86:         return greeting
 87: 
 88: # Let's test it quickly (outside the agent context)
 89: greeter = GreetingTool()
 90: result = greeter(name="Alice") # Calling the tool instance
 91: print(f"Tool returned: '{result}'")
 92: 
 93: # Expected Output:
 94: # --- GreetingTool activated with name: Alice ---
 95: # Tool returned: 'Hello, Alice! Nice to meet you.'
 96: ```
 97: 
 98: **Explanation:**
 99: 
100: 1.  **Import:** We import the base `Tool` class.
101: 2.  **Class Definition:** We define `GreetingTool` inheriting from `Tool`.
102: 3.  **Attributes:** We set the required class attributes: `name`, `description`, `inputs`, and `output_type`. These tell the agent everything it needs to know *about* the tool without running it.
103: 4.  **`forward` Method:** This method contains the core logic. It takes the `name` (defined in `inputs`) as an argument and returns the greeting string. We added a `print` statement just to see when it runs.
104: 5.  **Testing:** We create an instance `greeter` and call it like a function, passing the required argument `name="Alice"`. It executes the `forward` method and returns the result.
105: 
106: This `GreetingTool` is now ready to be added to an agent's toolbox!
107: 
108: ## Adding the Tool to Your Agent
109: 
110: Remember how we created our `MultiStepAgent` in [Chapter 1](01_multistepagent.md)? We gave it a model and a list of tools. Let's add our new `GreetingTool`:
111: 
112: ```python
113: # --- File: agent_with_greeting.py ---
114: # (Assuming GreetingTool is defined as above or imported)
115: # from simple_tools import GreetingTool
116: from smolagents import MultiStepAgent
117: from smolagents.models import LiteLLMModel # From Chapter 2
118: # Potentially other tools like SearchTool etc.
119: 
120: # 1. Create an instance of our new tool
121: greeting_tool = GreetingTool()
122: 
123: # 2. Create instances of any other tools the agent might need
124: # search_tool = SearchTool() # Example from Chapter 1
125: 
126: # 3. Choose a language model (the "brain")
127: llm = LiteLLMModel(model_id="gpt-3.5-turbo") # Needs API key setup
128: 
129: # 4. Create the MultiStepAgent, passing the tool(s) in a list
130: agent = MultiStepAgent(
131:     model=llm,
132:     tools=[greeting_tool] # Add our tool here! Maybe add search_tool too?
133:     # tools=[greeting_tool, search_tool]
134: )
135: 
136: print("Agent created with GreetingTool!")
137: 
138: # 5. Give the agent a task that might use the tool
139: task = "Greet the user named Bob."
140: print(f"Running agent with task: '{task}'")
141: 
142: # The agent will now start its Think-Act-Observe cycle...
143: final_answer = agent.run(task)
144: 
145: print("-" * 20)
146: print(f"Final Answer received: {final_answer}")
147: 
148: # --- Expected Interaction (Simplified) ---
149: # Agent (thinks): The task is to greet Bob. I have a 'greet_person' tool.
150: # Agent (acts): Use tool 'greet_person' with input name="Bob".
151: # --- GreetingTool activated with name: Bob --- (Our print statement)
152: # Agent (observes): Tool returned "Hello, Bob! Nice to meet you."
153: # Agent (thinks): I have the greeting. That completes the task.
154: # Agent (acts): Use 'final_answer' tool with "Hello, Bob! Nice to meet you."
155: # --------------------
156: # Final Answer received: Hello, Bob! Nice to meet you.
157: ```
158: 
159: **Explanation:**
160: 
161: 1.  We create an instance of `GreetingTool`.
162: 2.  We put this instance into the `tools` list when initializing `MultiStepAgent`.
163: 3.  The agent now "knows" about the `greet_person` tool, its description, and how to use it (via its `name` and `inputs`).
164: 4.  When we run the `agent` with the task "Greet the user named Bob," the LLM (using the tool descriptions provided in the prompt) will likely recognize that the `greet_person` tool is perfect for this.
165: 5.  The agent will then execute the `greeting_tool.forward(name="Bob")` method during its "Act" phase.
166: 
167: ## How the Agent Uses Tools: Under the Hood
168: 
169: Let's revisit the **Think -> Act -> Observe** cycle from [Chapter 1](01_multistepagent.md) and see exactly where tools fit in.
170: 
171: 1.  **Think:** The agent gathers its history ([AgentMemory](04_agentmemory.md)) and the available tool descriptions. It sends this to the LLM via the [Model Interface](02_model_interface.md) asking, "What should I do next to accomplish the task 'Greet Bob'?" The LLM, seeing the `greet_person` tool description, might respond with something like:
172:     ```json
173:     {
174:       "thought": "The user wants me to greet Bob. I should use the 'greet_person' tool.",
175:       "action": "greet_person",
176:       "action_input": {"name": "Bob"}
177:     }
178:     ```
179:     *(Note: The exact format depends on the agent type and model. Some models use explicit tool-calling formats like the one shown in Chapter 2's `ToolCallingAgent` example output).*
180: 
181: 2.  **Act:** The `MultiStepAgent` receives this response.
182:     *   It parses the response to identify the intended `action` (`greet_person`) and the `action_input` (`{"name": "Bob"}`).
183:     *   It looks up the tool named `greet_person` in its `self.tools` dictionary.
184:     *   It calls the `forward` method of that tool instance, passing the arguments from `action_input`. In our case: `greeting_tool.forward(name="Bob")`.
185:     *   This executes our Python code inside the `forward` method.
186: 
187: 3.  **Observe:** The agent captures the return value from the `forward` method (e.g., `"Hello, Bob! Nice to meet you."`). This becomes the "observation" for this step.
188:     *   This observation is stored in the [AgentMemory](04_agentmemory.md).
189:     *   The cycle repeats: The agent thinks again, now considering the result of the greeting tool. It likely decides the task is complete and uses the built-in `final_answer` tool.

191: Here's a simplified diagram:
192: 
193: ```mermaid
194: sequenceDiagram

205:     Agent-->>User: "Hello, Bob! Nice to meet you."
206: ```
207: 
208: **Code Glimpse (Simplified `execute_tool_call`):**
209: 
210: Inside the `agents.py` file (specifically within agent types like `ToolCallingAgent`), there's logic similar to this (heavily simplified):
211: 
212: ```python
213: # --- Simplified concept from agents.py ---
214: class SomeAgentType(MultiStepAgent):
215:     # ... other methods ...
216: 
217:     def execute_tool_call(self, tool_name: str, arguments: dict) -> Any:
218:         # Find the tool in the agent's toolbox
219:         if tool_name in self.tools:
220:             tool_instance = self.tools[tool_name]
221:             try:
222:                 # Call the tool's forward method with the arguments!
223:                 # This is where GreetingTool.forward(name="Bob") happens.
224:                 result = tool_instance(**arguments) # Uses ** to unpack the dict
225:                 return result
226:             except Exception as e:
227:                 # Handle errors if the tool fails
228:                 print(f"Error executing tool {tool_name}: {e}")
229:                 return f"Error: Tool {tool_name} failed."
230:         # ... handle case where tool_name is not found ...
231:         elif tool_name == "final_answer":
232:              # Special handling for the final answer
233:              return arguments.get("answer", arguments) # Return the final answer content
234:         else:
235:             return f"Error: Unknown tool {tool_name}."
236: 
237:     def step(self, memory_step: ActionStep):
238:         # ... (Agent thinks and gets LLM response) ...
239:         llm_response = # ... result from self.model(...) ...
240: 
241:         if llm_response suggests a tool call:
242:              tool_name = # ... parse tool name from response ...
243:              arguments = # ... parse arguments from response ...
244: 
245:              # === ACT ===
246:              observation = self.execute_tool_call(tool_name, arguments)
247:              memory_step.observations = str(observation) # Store observation
248: 
249:              if tool_name == "final_answer":
250:                  return observation # Signal that this is the final answer
251:         # ... (handle cases where LLM gives text instead of tool call) ...
252:         return None # Not the final answer yet
253: ```
254: 
255: This shows the core idea: the agent gets the `tool_name` and `arguments` from the LLM, finds the corresponding `Tool` object, and calls its `forward` method using the arguments.
256: 
257: ## Common Built-in Tools
258: 
259: `SmolaAgents` comes with several useful tools ready to use (found in `default_tools.py`):
260: 
261: *   **`DuckDuckGoSearchTool` (`web_search`)**: Searches the web using DuckDuckGo.
262: *   **`PythonInterpreterTool` (`python_interpreter`)**: Executes Python code snippets safely. Very powerful for calculations, data manipulation, etc. (Used primarily by `CodeAgent`, see [Chapter 6: PythonExecutor](06_pythonexecutor.md)).
263: *   **`VisitWebpageTool` (`visit_webpage`)**: Fetches the content of a webpage URL.
264: *   **`FinalAnswerTool` (`final_answer`)**: A special, essential tool. The agent uses this *only* when it believes it has completed the task and has the final result. Calling this tool usually ends the agent's run. It's automatically added to every agent.
265: 
266: You can import and use these just like we used our `GreetingTool`:
267: 
268: ```python
269: from smolagents.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchTool, FinalAnswerTool # FinalAnswerTool is usually added automatically
270: 
271: search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchTool()
272: # calculator_tool = PythonInterpreterTool() # Often used internally by CodeAgent
273: 
274: agent = MultiStepAgent(
275:     model=llm,
276:     tools=[search_tool] # Agent can now search!
277: )

280: ## Conclusion
281: 
282: Tools are the bridge between an agent's reasoning and the real world (or specific functionalities like code execution). They are reusable capabilities defined by their `name`, `description`, `inputs`, `output_type`, and the core logic in their `forward` method.
283: 
284: You've learned:
285: 
286: *   Why agents need tools (like a chef needs utensils).
287: *   The essential components of a `Tool` in `SmolaAgents`.
288: *   How to create a simple custom tool (`GreetingTool`).
289: *   How to give tools to your `MultiStepAgent`.
290: *   How the agent uses the LLM's suggestions to select and execute the correct tool during the "Act" phase.
291: *   About some common built-in tools.
292: 
293: By equipping your agent with the right set of tools, you dramatically expand the range of tasks it can accomplish! But as the agent takes multiple steps, using tools and getting results, how does it keep track of everything that has happened? That's where memory comes in.

  8: # Chapter 4: AgentMemory - The Agent's Notepad
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 3: Tool](03_tool.md), we equipped our agent with "superpowers" – tools like web search or calculators that let it interact with the world and perform actions. We saw how the agent's "brain" (the LLM) decides which tool to use, and the agent executes it.
 11: 
 12: But wait... how does the agent remember what it has already done? If it searches for the capital of France in Step 1, how does it remember "Paris" when deciding what to do in Step 2 (like finding the weather in Paris)?
 13: 
 14: This is where **AgentMemory** comes in. Think of it as the agent's dedicated notepad or, even better, a **ship's logbook**.
 15: 
 16: ## The Problem: An Agent with Amnesia
 17: 
 18: Imagine a captain sailing a ship on a long voyage. After each hour, they completely forget everything that happened before – the course they set, the islands they passed, the storms they weathered. How could they possibly reach their destination? They'd be lost!
 19: 
 20: ![Confused Captain](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/confused.png) ❓ "Where am I? What was I doing?"
 21: 
 22: An agent without memory is like that forgetful captain. It might perform a single action correctly, but it wouldn't understand the context. It wouldn't know:
 23: 
 24: *   What the original goal (task) was.
 25: *   What steps it has already taken.
 26: *   What results (observations) it got from those steps.
 27: *   What errors it might have encountered.
 28: 
 29: Without this history, the agent can't make informed decisions about what to do next. It can't build upon previous results or learn from mistakes within the same task.
 30: 
 31: ## The Solution: The Ship's Logbook (`AgentMemory`)
 32: 
 33: The `AgentMemory` is the component that solves this problem. It automatically records every significant event during the agent's "voyage" (its execution run).
 34: 
 35: ![Ship's Logbook](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/scroll.png) 📜 "Log Entry: Searched 'Capital of France'. Result: 'Paris'."
 36: 
 37: Just like a ship's logbook helps the captain navigate, the `AgentMemory` helps the agent maintain context and proceed effectively.
 38: 
 39: ## What Does the `AgentMemory` Store?
 40: 
 41: The `AgentMemory` keeps a chronological record of the agent's journey. For each run, it typically stores:
 42: 
 43: 1.  **System Prompt:** The initial instructions given to the agent's LLM brain (we'll see more in [Chapter 5: PromptTemplates](05_prompttemplates.md)).
 44: 2.  **Initial Task:** The main goal the user gave the agent (e.g., "What is the capital of France, and what is its current weather?").
 45: 3.  **Steps:** A list detailing each cycle of the agent's operation:
 46:     *   **Planning (Optional):** If the agent makes plans, the plan itself is recorded.
 47:     *   **Thinking:** The LLM's reasoning process and the action it decided to take (e.g., "Thought: I need the capital. Action: Use `search` tool").
 48:     *   **Action:** The specific [Tool](03_tool.md) called and the arguments used (e.g., `search("Capital of France")`). This could also be code execution for code-based agents.
 49:     *   **Observation:** The result received after performing the action (e.g., "Paris").
 50:     *   **Errors:** If something went wrong during the step (e.g., a tool failed), the error is noted.
 51: 
 52: This detailed history allows the agent (specifically, the LLM guiding it) to look back at any point and understand the full context before deciding the next move.
 53: 
 54: ## How is `AgentMemory` Used? (Mostly Automatic!)
 55: 
 56: The good news is that you, as the user, usually don't need to interact directly with `AgentMemory`. The `MultiStepAgent` manages it automatically behind the scenes!
 57: 
 58: Here's the key interaction:
 59: 
 60: 1.  **Before "Thinking":** When the agent needs to decide the next step (the "Think" phase), the `MultiStepAgent` asks the `AgentMemory` to format the recorded history (task, previous actions, observations, errors) into a sequence of messages. This happens via a method often called `write_memory_to_messages`.
 61: 2.  **Consulting the Brain:** This formatted history is sent to the LLM via the [Model Interface](02_model_interface.md). This gives the LLM the full context it needs to provide a sensible next step. ("Okay, based on the task 'Capital and Weather', and the fact we just found 'Paris', what should we do now?").
 62: 3.  **After "Acting" and "Observing":** Once the agent performs an action and gets an observation (or an error), the `MultiStepAgent` records this new information as a new step in the `AgentMemory`.
 63: 
 64: So, the memory is constantly being read from (to inform the LLM) and written to (to record new events).
 65: 
 66: ## Example Revisited: Capital and Weather Logbook
 67: 
 68: Let's trace our "Capital of France and Weather" example from [Chapter 1: MultiStepAgent](01_multistepagent.md) and see what the `AgentMemory` logbook might look like (simplified):
 69: 
 70: **(Start of Run)**
 71: 
 72: 1.  **System Prompt:** Recorded (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant...")
 73: 2.  **Task:** Recorded (`task: "What is the capital of France, and what is its current weather?"`)
 74: 
 75: **(Step 1)**
 76: 
 77: 3.  **Think/Action:** Recorded (`thought: "Need capital.", action: search("Capital of France")`)
 78: 4.  **Observation:** Recorded (`observation: "Paris"`)
 79: 
 80: **(Step 2)**
 81: 
 82: 5.  **Think/Action:** Recorded (`thought: "Have capital (Paris), need weather.", action: weather("Paris")`)
 83: 6.  **Observation:** Recorded (`observation: "Sunny, 25°C"`)
 84: 
 85: **(Step 3)**
 86: 
 87: 7.  **Think/Action:** Recorded (`thought: "Have capital and weather. Task complete.", action: final_answer("The capital of France is Paris, and the current weather there is Sunny, 25°C.")`)
 88: 8.  **Observation:** Recorded (Result of `final_answer` is the final output).
 89: 
 90: **(End of Run)**
 91: 
 92: Now, before Step 2 started, the agent would read entries 1-4 from memory to give context to the LLM. Before Step 3, it would read entries 1-6. This prevents the agent from forgetting what it's doing!
 93: 
 94: ## Under the Hood: Memory Structure
 95: 
 96: How does `SmolaAgents` actually implement this?
 97: 
 98: **Core Idea:** The `AgentMemory` object holds a list called `steps`. Each item in this list represents one distinct event or phase in the agent's run. These items are usually instances of specific "Step" classes.
 99: 
100: **Key Step Types (Simplified from `memory.py`):**
101: 
102: *   `SystemPromptStep`: Stores the initial system prompt text.
103: *   `TaskStep`: Stores the user's task description (and potentially input images).
104: *   `PlanningStep` (Optional): Stores any explicit plans the agent generates.
105: *   `ActionStep`: This is the most common one, recording a single Think-Act-Observe cycle. It contains fields for:
106:     *   `step_number`
107:     *   `model_input_messages`: What was sent to the LLM for thinking.
108:     *   `model_output_message`: The LLM's raw response (thought + action plan).
109:     *   `tool_calls`: Which [Tool](03_tool.md) was called (name, arguments). Stored as `ToolCall` objects.
110:     *   `observations`: The result returned by the tool.
111:     *   `error`: Any error that occurred.
112:     *   `start_time`, `end_time`, `duration`: Timing information.
113: *   `FinalAnswerStep`: A special step indicating the final result returned by the agent.
114: 
115: **Interaction Flow:**
116: 
117: Here's how the `MultiStepAgent` uses `AgentMemory`:

327: 
328:             # 5. Record observation
329:             memory_step.observations = str(observation)
330: 
331:             # 6. Check if it's the final answer
332:             if tool_name == "final_answer":
333:                  return observation # Return the final answer to stop the loop
334:             else:
335:                  return None # Continue to the next step
336: 
337:         # ... other methods like _create_action_step, _finalize_step ...
338:     ```
339: 
340: **Key Takeaways from Code:**
341: *   Memory holds a list of `Step` objects (`self.memory.steps`).
342: *   The agent adds new `TaskStep` or `ActionStep` objects to this list as it progresses (`self.memory.steps.append(...)`).
343: *   Before calling the LLM, `write_memory_to_messages` iterates through `self.memory.steps`, calling `to_messages()` on each step to build the history.
344: *   Each step (like `ActionStep`) stores details like the LLM's output (`model_output`), tool calls (`tool_calls`), and results (`observations` or `error`).
345: 
346: ## Conclusion
347: 
348: `AgentMemory` is the agent's essential logbook, providing the context needed to navigate complex, multi-step tasks. It diligently records the initial task, system instructions, and every action, observation, and error along the way.
349: 
350: You've learned:
351: 
352: *   Why memory is crucial for agents (avoiding amnesia).
353: *   The "ship's logbook" analogy.
354: *   What kind of information `AgentMemory` stores (task, system prompt, steps with thoughts, actions, observations, errors).
355: *   How the `MultiStepAgent` uses memory automatically: reading history before thinking, and writing results after acting/observing.
356: *   The basic structure of `AgentMemory` and its `Step` objects (`TaskStep`, `ActionStep`).
357: 
358: While you often don't need to manipulate memory directly, understanding its role is key to understanding how agents maintain context and achieve complex goals. The content of this memory directly influences the prompts sent to the LLM. How can we customize those prompts? Let's find out!

  8: # Chapter 5: PromptTemplates - Crafting Your Agent's Script
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 4: AgentMemory](04_agentmemory.md), we learned how our agent uses its "logbook" (`AgentMemory`) to remember the task, its past actions, and observations. This memory is crucial for deciding the next step.
 11: 
 12: But how exactly does the agent *use* this memory to talk to its LLM brain ([Chapter 2: Model Interface](02_model_interface.md))? How does it tell the LLM:
 13: *   "Here's your overall job..."
 14: *   "Here are the tools ([Chapter 3: Tool](03_tool.md)) you can use..."
 15: *   "Here's the specific task..."
 16: *   "Here's what happened so far..."
 17: *   "Now, tell me what to do next!"
 18: 
 19: Simply dumping the raw memory might confuse the LLM. We need a structured way to present this information – like giving someone clear, consistent instructions. This is where **PromptTemplates** come in!
 20: 
 21: ## The Problem: Giving Clear Instructions Every Time
 22: 
 23: Imagine you have a very capable assistant, but you need to explain their role and the current task *every single time* you talk to them. You'd want a standard way to do this, right? You'd probably have a template:
 24: 
 25: *   "Good morning! Remember, your main goal is [Overall Goal]."
 26: *   "For this specific task, [Task Description], you have these resources available: [List of Resources]."
 27: *   "So far, we've done [Summary of Progress]."
 28: *   "What should we do next?"
 29: 
 30: If you just improvised every time, your instructions might be inconsistent, confusing, or miss important details.
 31: 
 32: Our AI agent faces the same challenge. It needs to send instructions (prompts) to the LLM at various points (like the very beginning, before each step, maybe when planning). These instructions need to include:
 33: *   The agent's basic persona and rules.
 34: *   Descriptions of the available [Tools](03_tool.md).
 35: *   The current `task`.
 36: *   Relevant parts of the [AgentMemory](04_agentmemory.md).
 37: 
 38: How can we manage these instructions effectively and dynamically include the specific details for the current situation?
 39: 
 40: ## The Solution: Mad Libs for Agents! (`PromptTemplates`)
 41: 
 42: Remember Mad Libs? The game where you have a story template with blanks like `[NOUN]`, `[VERB]`, `[ADJECTIVE]`, and you fill them in to create a funny story?
 43: 
 44: ![Mad Libs Example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Mad_Libs_logo.svg/320px-Mad_Libs_logo.svg.png)
 45: 
 46: **PromptTemplates** in `SmolaAgents` work a lot like that!
 47: 
 48: *   They are a collection of **pre-written instruction templates**.
 49: *   These templates have **placeholders** (like `{{ task }}` or `{{ tools }}`) for information that changes with each run or step.
 50: *   They use a powerful templating engine called **Jinja2** (common in web development) to fill in these blanks.
 51: *   The `MultiStepAgent` automatically picks the right template, fills in the blanks with current data (like the task description, tool list from [Chapter 3: Tool](03_tool.md), or memory summary from [Chapter 4: AgentMemory](04_agentmemory.md)), and sends the final, complete prompt to the LLM.
 52: 
 53: This ensures the LLM gets clear, consistent, and context-rich instructions every time.
 54: 
 55: ## What's Inside the `PromptTemplates` Collection?
 56: 
 57: The `PromptTemplates` object is essentially a structured dictionary holding different template strings for different situations. The main ones are:
 58: 
 59: 1.  **`system_prompt`**: This is the **master instruction manual** given to the LLM at the very beginning of the conversation. It tells the LLM:
 60:     *   Its overall role or personality (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant that uses tools...").
 61:     *   The rules it must follow (e.g., "Always think step-by-step," "Use the `final_answer` tool when done.").
 62:     *   **Crucially, the descriptions of the available `{{ tools }}` and `{{ managed_agents }}` (if any).** This is how the LLM learns what capabilities the agent has!
 63:     *   The format it should use for its response (e.g., "Provide your reasoning in a 'Thought:' section and the action in a 'Code:' section").
 64: 
 65: 2.  **`planning`**: This group contains templates used only if the agent's planning feature is turned on (often for more complex tasks). It includes templates for:
 66:     *   Generating an initial plan based on the `{{ task }}` and `{{ tools }}`.
 67:     *   Updating the plan based on progress stored in memory.
 68:     *(Planning is a bit more advanced, so we won't focus heavily on these templates here).*
 69: 
 70: 3.  **`final_answer`**: These templates are used in specific scenarios, like when the agent hits its maximum step limit (`max_steps`) and needs the LLM to try and generate a final answer based on the conversation history (`{{ task }}`, memory).
 71: 
 72: 4.  **`managed_agent`**: If you build agents that can call *other* agents (like team members), these templates define how the calling agent instructs the "managed" agent (`{{ name }}`, `{{ task }}`) and how the result (`{{ final_answer }}`) is reported back.
 73: 
 74: The most important one for understanding basic agent behavior is the **`system_prompt`**. It sets the stage for the entire interaction.
 75: 
 76: ## How It Works: Filling in the Blanks with Jinja2
 77: 
 78: Let's imagine a simplified `system_prompt` template:
 79: 
 80: ```jinja
 81: You are a helpful assistant.
 82: Your task is to achieve the goal described by the user.
 83: You have access to the following tools:
 84: {{ tools }}
 85: 
 86: Think step-by-step and then choose a tool to use or use the final_answer tool.
 87: ```
 88: 
 89: Now, let's say our agent is created with a `SearchTool` and our `GreetingTool` from [Chapter 3: Tool](03_tool.md).
 90: 
 91: 1.  **Agent Starts:** The `MultiStepAgent` needs to prepare the initial message for the LLM.
 92: 2.  **Get Template:** It retrieves the `system_prompt` template string.
 93: 3.  **Get Data:** It gets the list of actual tool instances (`[SearchTool(...), GreetingTool(...)]`). It formats their names and descriptions into a string. Let's say this formatted string is:
 94:     ```
 95:     - web_search: Searches the web...
 96:     - greet_person: Greets a person by name...
 97:     - final_answer: Use this when you have the final answer...
 98:     ```
 99: 4.  **Fill Blanks (Render):** It uses the Jinja2 engine to replace `{{ tools }}` in the template with the formatted tool descriptions.
100: 5.  **Final Prompt:** The resulting prompt sent to the LLM would be:
101: 
102:     ```text
103:     You are a helpful assistant.
104:     Your task is to achieve the goal described by the user.
105:     You have access to the following tools:
106:     - web_search: Searches the web...
107:     - greet_person: Greets a person by name...
108:     - final_answer: Use this when you have the final answer...
109: 
110:     Think step-by-step and then choose a tool to use or use the final_answer tool.
111:     ```
112: 
113: This final, complete prompt gives the LLM all the context it needs to start working on the user's task.
114: 
115: Here's a diagram of the process:
116: 
117: ```mermaid
118: graph LR
119:     A["Prompt Template String<br/>System Prompt with \{\{ tools \}\}"] --> C{Jinja2 Engine};
120:     B["Agent Data<br/>(Formatted Tool Descriptions)"] --> C;
121:     C --> D["Final Prompt String<br/>(System Prompt with actual tools listed)"];
122:     D --> E["LLM Brain"];
123: ```
124: 
125: The agent uses similar logic for other templates, inserting `{{ task }}`, snippets from [AgentMemory](04_agentmemory.md), etc., as needed.
126: 
127: ## Using `PromptTemplates` in `SmolaAgents`
128: 
129: The good news is that `SmolaAgents` handles most of this automatically!
130: 
131: *   **Defaults:** When you create an agent like `CodeAgent` or `ToolCallingAgent`, it comes pre-loaded with sophisticated default `PromptTemplates` tailored for that agent type. These defaults live in YAML files within the `SmolaAgents` library (e.g., `prompts/code_agent.yaml`, `prompts/toolcalling_agent.yaml`). These files define the `system_prompt`, `planning` prompts, etc., with all the necessary placeholders.
132: 
133: *   **Automatic Loading:** The agent's `__init__` method loads these default templates unless you explicitly provide your own.
134: 
135: Let's look at a simplified snippet from `agents.py` showing how a `CodeAgent` might initialize its system prompt:
136: 
137: ```python
138: # --- File: agents.py (Simplified CodeAgent __init__ and initialize_system_prompt) ---
139: import yaml
140: import importlib.resources
141: from .tools import Tool # From Chapter 3
142: from .agents import MultiStepAgent, populate_template, PromptTemplates # Helper function
143: 
144: class CodeAgent(MultiStepAgent):
145:     def __init__(
146:         self,
147:         tools: list[Tool],
148:         model: callable,
149:         prompt_templates: PromptTemplates | None = None, # Allow custom templates
150:         # ... other parameters ...
151:     ):
152:         # 1. Load default templates if none provided
153:         if prompt_templates is None:
154:             # Find the default 'code_agent.yaml' file
155:             default_yaml_path = importlib.resources.files("smolagents.prompts").joinpath("code_agent.yaml")
156:             # Load the templates from the YAML file
157:             prompt_templates = yaml.safe_load(default_yaml_path.read_text())
158: 
159:         # 2. Call the parent class init, passing the templates along
160:         super().__init__(
161:             tools=tools,
162:             model=model,
163:             prompt_templates=prompt_templates, # Use loaded or provided templates
164:             # ... other parameters ...
165:         )
166:         # ... rest of CodeAgent setup ...
167:         # self.system_prompt is set later using initialize_system_prompt
168: 
169:     def initialize_system_prompt(self) -> str:
170:         """Creates the final system prompt string by filling the template."""
171:         # 3. Get necessary data (tools, managed agents, authorized imports)
172:         formatted_tools = # ... format self.tools for the template ...
173:         formatted_managed_agents = # ... format self.managed_agents ...
174:         authorized_imports = # ... get list of allowed imports for CodeAgent ...
175: 
176:         # 4. Use the populate_template helper to fill in the blanks
177:         system_prompt_string = populate_template(
178:             template=self.prompt_templates["system_prompt"], # Get the template string
179:             variables={ # Provide the data for the placeholders
180:                 "tools": formatted_tools,
181:                 "managed_agents": formatted_managed_agents,
182:                 "authorized_imports": authorized_imports,
183:                 # ... other potential variables ...
184:             }
185:         )
186:         return system_prompt_string
187: 
188:     # ... other CodeAgent methods ...
189: 
190: # --- Helper function used internally (Simplified from agents.py) ---
191: from jinja2 import Template, StrictUndefined
192: 
193: def populate_template(template: str, variables: dict) -> str:
194:     """Renders a Jinja2 template string with given variables."""
195:     compiled_template = Template(template, undefined=StrictUndefined)
196:     try:
197:         # This does the magic of replacing {{ placeholder }} with actual values
198:         return compiled_template.render(**variables)
199:     except Exception as e:
200:         raise Exception(f"Error rendering Jinja template: {e}")
201: 
202: ```
203: 
204: **Explanation:**
205: 
206: 1.  **Load Defaults:** If the user doesn't provide custom `prompt_templates` when creating a `CodeAgent`, it loads the defaults from the `code_agent.yaml` file.
207: 2.  **Store Templates:** The loaded templates (either default or custom) are stored within the agent instance (via the `super().__init__` call).
208: 3.  **Get Data:** When the agent needs the final system prompt (e.g., during `run`), the `initialize_system_prompt` method gathers the current list of tools, managed agents, etc.
209: 4.  **Render Template:** It calls the `populate_template` helper function. This function uses Jinja2's `Template(...).render(...)` to take the `system_prompt` template string and the collected `variables` (tools, etc.) and produces the final, ready-to-use prompt string.
210: 
211: *For beginners, you usually don't need to write your own templates. The defaults are designed to work well.* However, understanding that these templates exist and how they work helps you understand *why* the agent behaves the way it does and how it knows about its tools.
212: 
213: If you *do* want to see what these templates look like, you can inspect the `.yaml` files inside the `smolagents/prompts/` directory in the library's source code. For example, here's a small part of a typical `system_prompt` for a `CodeAgent`:
214: 
215: ```yaml
216: # --- Snippet from prompts/code_agent.yaml ---
217: system_prompt: |-
218:   You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs.
219:   # ... (lots of instructions and examples) ...
220: 
221:   You only have access to these tools:
222:   {%- for tool in tools.values() %}
223:   - {{ tool.name }}: {{ tool.description }}
224:       Takes inputs: {{tool.inputs}}
225:       Returns an output of type: {{tool.output_type}}
226:   {%- endfor %}
227: 
228:   {%- if managed_agents and managed_agents.values() | list %}
229:   You can also give tasks to team members.
230:   # ... (instructions for managed agents) ...
231:   {%- for agent in managed_agents.values() %}
232:   - {{ agent.name }}: {{ agent.description }}
233:   {%- endfor %}
234:   {%- endif %}
235: 
236:   Here are the rules you should always follow:
237:   # ... (more rules) ...
238:   You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: {{authorized_imports}}
239:   # ... (rest of the prompt) ...
240: ```
241: 
242: {% raw %}
243: You can see the `{{ tools }}`, `{{ managed_agents }}`, and `{{ authorized_imports }}` placeholders ready to be filled in. The `{%- for ... %}` syntax is Jinja2's way of looping through lists (like the list of tools).
244: {% endraw %}
245: 
246: ## Conclusion
247: 
248: `PromptTemplates` are the unsung heroes that shape the conversation between the agent and its LLM brain. They act like customizable scripts or Mad Libs templates, ensuring the LLM receives clear, consistent instructions filled with the specific details it needs (like the task, available tools, and memory context).
249: 
250: You've learned:
251: 
252: {% raw %}
253: *   Why structured prompts are necessary for guiding LLMs effectively.
254: *   The "Mad Libs" analogy for `PromptTemplates`.
255: *   How Jinja2 is used to fill placeholders like `{{ task }}` and `{{ tools }}`.
256: *   The main types of prompts stored (`system_prompt`, `planning`, `final_answer`).
257: *   That `SmolaAgents` provides sensible default templates, especially the crucial `system_prompt`.
258: *   How the agent automatically renders these templates with current data before sending them to the LLM.
259: {% endraw %}
260: 
261: Understanding `PromptTemplates` helps you grasp how the agent frames its requests to the LLM. While you might stick to the defaults initially, knowing this mechanism exists opens the door to customizing agent behavior later on.
262: 
263: One of the most powerful tools often described in these prompts, especially for `CodeAgent`, is the ability to execute Python code. How is that done safely? Let's find out!

  8: # Chapter 6: PythonExecutor - Running Code Safely
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In [Chapter 5: PromptTemplates](05_prompttemplates.md), we saw how agents use templates to create clear instructions for their LLM brain. These instructions often involve asking the LLM to generate code, especially for agents like `CodeAgent`, which are designed to solve problems by writing and running Python.
 11: 
 12: But wait... running code generated by an AI? Isn't that risky? What if the AI generates code that tries to delete your files, access sensitive information, or just crashes?
 13: 
 14: This is a very valid concern! You wouldn't want an AI assistant to accidentally (or intentionally!) cause harm to your computer. We need a secure way to run this generated code.
 15: 
 16: This is exactly the problem the **`PythonExecutor`** solves!
 17: 
 18: ## The Problem: Running Untrusted Code
 19: 
 20: Imagine you have a brilliant but slightly unpredictable scientist (the `CodeAgent`) who comes up with new experiments (Python code snippets) to solve problems. You want the results of these experiments, but you can't let the scientist run them directly in your main lab (your computer) because they might spill dangerous chemicals or break expensive equipment.
 21: 
 22: ![Risky Scientist](https://img.icons8.com/external-flaticons-lineal-color-flat-icons/64/external-scientist-professions-man-flaticons-lineal-color-flat-icons-3.png) ➡️ 🔥💻 (Danger!)
 23: 
 24: Directly executing AI-generated code is like letting that unpredictable scientist run wild. We need a controlled environment.
 25: 
 26: ## The Solution: The Secure Laboratory (`PythonExecutor`)
 27: 
 28: The `PythonExecutor` acts like a **secure, isolated laboratory** or a **sandbox** for the code generated by the `CodeAgent`.
 29: 
 30: ![Safe Lab](https://img.icons8.com/external-flaticons-flat-flat-icons/64/external-laboratory-science-flaticons-flat-flat-icons.png) <-> 👨‍🔬 CodeAgent
 31: 
 32: Think of it this way:
 33: 
 34: 1.  **Isolation:** The `PythonExecutor` creates a safe space, separate from your main system, where the code can run. If the code tries to do something harmful, the damage is contained within this sandbox and doesn't affect your computer.
 35: 2.  **Execution:** It takes the Python code snippet provided by the `CodeAgent` and runs it within this safe environment.
 36: 3.  **State Management:** Just like a real lab keeps track of ongoing experiments, the `PythonExecutor` can remember variables and the state *between* different code snippets run in sequence. If one snippet calculates `x = 5`, the next snippet run by the same executor will know the value of `x`.
 37: 4.  **Capture Results:** It carefully observes what happens inside the sandbox, capturing any output produced by the code (like results from `print()` statements) and the final result of the code snippet.
 38: 5.  **Handle Errors:** If the code crashes or produces an error, the `PythonExecutor` catches the error message instead of letting it crash the whole agent.
 39: 
 40: Essentially, the `PythonExecutor` allows the `CodeAgent` to "run experiments" safely and report back the findings (or failures) without endangering the outside world.
 41: 
 42: ## How Does the `CodeAgent` Use It? (Mostly Automatic!)
 43: 
 44: For beginners, the great news is that the `CodeAgent` handles the `PythonExecutor` automatically! When you create a `CodeAgent`, it usually sets up a `PythonExecutor` behind the scenes.
 45: 
 46: ```python
 47: # --- File: create_code_agent.py ---
 48: from smolagents import CodeAgent
 49: from smolagents.models import LiteLLMModel # From Chapter 2
 50: # Assume we have some tools defined, maybe a search tool
 51: from smolagents.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchTool
 52: 
 53: search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchTool()
 54: 
 55: # Choose a language model
 56: llm = LiteLLMModel(model_id="gpt-4-turbo") # Needs API key setup
 57: 
 58: # Create the CodeAgent
 59: # It automatically creates a PythonExecutor internally!
 60: agent = CodeAgent(
 61:     model=llm,

 76: ```
 77: 
 78: **Explanation:**
 79: 
 80: *   When we create `CodeAgent`, we don't explicitly create a `PythonExecutor`. The `CodeAgent`'s initialization logic does this for us.
 81: *   By default, it uses a `LocalPythonExecutor`, which runs the code in a restricted local environment.
 82: *   When `agent.run()` is called, and the LLM generates Python code, the `CodeAgent` automatically passes that code to its internal `python_executor` instance for execution.
 83: 
 84: ## Local vs. Remote Execution
 85: 
 86: `SmolaAgents` offers different types of executors for varying levels of security and environment needs:
 87: 
 88: 1.  **`LocalPythonExecutor` (Default):**
 89:     *   Runs the code within the same Python process as your agent, but uses clever techniques (like parsing the code's Abstract Syntax Tree - AST) to restrict dangerous operations (like file system access or arbitrary imports).
 90:     *   It's the simplest to set up (usually requires no extra installation).
 91:     *   It's generally safe for many tasks, but a very complex or malicious piece of code *might* potentially find ways around the restrictions (though this is difficult).
 92: 
 93: 2.  **`DockerExecutor`:**
 94:     *   Runs the code inside a separate Docker container. Docker provides strong isolation from your main system.
 95:     *   Requires Docker to be installed and running on your machine.
 96:     *   Offers better security than the local executor.
 97: 
 98: 3.  **`E2BExecutor` (Environment-to-Behavior):**
 99:     *   Uses a cloud service (E2B.dev) to provide secure, sandboxed cloud environments for code execution.
100:     *   Requires an E2B account and API key.
101:     *   Offers very strong security and avoids needing Docker locally, but relies on an external service.
102: 
103: **How to Choose?**
104: 
105: *   **Beginners:** Stick with the default `LocalPythonExecutor`. It's usually sufficient and requires no extra setup.
106: *   **Need Higher Security:** If you're running potentially riskier code or need stronger guarantees, consider `DockerExecutor` (if you have Docker) or `E2BExecutor`.
107: 
108: You can specify the executor type when creating the `CodeAgent`:
109: 
110: ```python
111: # Example: Using a Docker executor (if Docker is installed and running)
112: docker_agent = CodeAgent(
113:     model=llm,
114:     tools=[search_tool],
115:     executor_type="docker" # Tell the agent to use Docker
116:     # You might need to pass executor_kwargs for specific configurations
117: )
118: 
119: # Example: Using E2B (requires E2B setup and API key in environment)
120: # pip install 'smolagents[e2b]'
121: e2b_agent = CodeAgent(
122:     model=llm,
123:     tools=[search_tool],
124:     executor_type="e2b" # Tell the agent to use E2B
125: )
126: ```
127: 
128: For the rest of this chapter, we'll mostly focus on the concepts common to all executors, using the default `LocalPythonExecutor` as the main example.
129: 
130: ## Under the Hood: How Execution Works
131: 
132: Let's trace what happens when `CodeAgent` decides to run a piece of code:
133: 
134: 1.  **Agent (Think):** The LLM generates a response containing Python code, like:
135:     ```python
136:     # Thought: I need to calculate 5 * 10.
137:     result = 5 * 10
138:     print(f"The intermediate result is: {result}")
139:     final_answer(result)
140:     ```
141: 2.  **Agent (Act - Parse):** The `CodeAgent` extracts the Python code block.
142: 3.  **Agent (Act - Execute):** The `CodeAgent` calls its `python_executor` instance, passing the code string. `output, logs, is_final = self.python_executor(code_string)`
143: 4.  **Executor (Prepare):** The `PythonExecutor` (e.g., `LocalPythonExecutor`) gets ready. It knows the current state (variables defined in previous steps).
144: 5.  **Executor (Run Safely):**
145:     *   `LocalPythonExecutor`: Parses the code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It walks through the tree, evaluating allowed operations (math, variable assignments, safe function calls) and blocking dangerous ones (like `os.system`). It executes the code within the current `state`.
146:     *   `DockerExecutor`/`E2BExecutor`: Sends the code to the remote environment (Docker container or E2B sandbox) for execution.
147: 6.  **Executor (Capture):** It intercepts any output sent to `print()` (captured in `logs`) and gets the final value returned by the code block (if any, captured in `output`). It also checks if the special `final_answer()` function was called (indicated by `is_final`).
148: 7.  **Executor (Update State):** If the code assigned variables (like `result = 50`), the executor updates its internal `state` dictionary.
149: 8.  **Agent (Observe):** The `CodeAgent` receives the `output`, `logs`, and `is_final` flag from the executor. This becomes the "Observation" for the current step. If `is_final` is true, the agent knows the task is complete.

151: **Diagram:**

165:     SafeEnv->>Executor: Capture print() output ("The intermediate result is: 50")
166:     SafeEnv->>Executor: Capture final result (50)
167:     SafeEnv->>Executor: Indicate if final_answer() was called
168:     Executor-->>Agent: Return: output=50, logs="...", is_final=True

171: ## Code Glimpse: Where is the Executor Used?
172: 
173: Let's look at simplified snippets showing the key interactions.
174: 
175: *   **`CodeAgent` Initialization (`agents.py`):** Creates the executor instance.
176: 
177:     ```python

222:     ```
223:     *   The `CodeAgent` takes `executor_type` and related arguments.
224:     *   The `create_python_executor` method instantiates the correct class (`LocalPythonExecutor`, `DockerExecutor`, or `E2BExecutor`).
225:     *   Initial tools and state might be sent to the executor using `send_tools` and `send_variables`.

353: ## Conclusion
354: 
355: The `PythonExecutor` is a critical safety component in `SmolaAgents`, especially when using `CodeAgent`. It provides a secure sandbox (local or remote) to execute AI-generated Python code, preventing potential harm while still allowing the agent to leverage code for complex calculations, data manipulation, and interacting with tools.
356: 
357: You've learned:
358: 
359: *   Why safe code execution is essential when dealing with AI-generated code.
360: *   The "secure laboratory" analogy for `PythonExecutor`.
361: *   Its key responsibilities: isolation, execution, state management, and capturing output/errors.
362: *   How `CodeAgent` uses it automatically (usually the `LocalPythonExecutor` by default).
363: *   The difference between `LocalPythonExecutor`, `DockerExecutor`, and `E2BExecutor`.
364: *   The basic flow of execution: Agent -> Executor -> Safe Environment -> State -> Executor -> Agent.
365: *   Where the executor is created and used within the `CodeAgent` code.
366: 
367: While you might not interact with the `PythonExecutor` directly very often as a beginner, understanding its role is crucial for trusting your agents and knowing how they perform code-based actions safely.
368: 
369: So far, we've seen `CodeAgent` and `ToolCallingAgent`. Are these the only types of agents? How can we define different agent behaviors?
370: 
371: **Next Chapter:** [Chapter 7: AgentType](07_agenttype.md) - Defining Agent Behaviors.

  8: # Chapter 7: AgentType - Handling More Than Just Text
  9: 
 10: Welcome back! In the previous chapters, especially when discussing [Tools](03_tool.md) and the [PythonExecutor](06_pythonexecutor.md), we saw how agents can perform actions and generate results. So far, we've mostly focused on text-based tasks and results.
 11: 
 12: But what happens when an agent needs to work with images, audio, or other types of data? For example:
 13: *   An agent uses a tool to generate an image based on a description.
 14: *   An agent uses a tool to transcribe an audio file into text.
 15: *   An agent receives an image as input and needs to describe it.
 16: 
 17: How does the `SmolaAgents` framework handle these different kinds of data consistently? How does it make sure an image generated by a tool is displayed correctly in your notebook, or saved properly in the agent's [Memory](04_agentmemory.md)?
 18: 
 19: This is where the **`AgentType`** concept comes in!

 21: ## The Problem: Shipping Different Kinds of Cargo

 23: Imagine you run a shipping company. Most of the time, you ship standard boxes (like text). But sometimes, customers need to ship different things:
 24: *   Fresh produce that needs a refrigerated container (like audio data).
 25: *   Large machinery that needs a flatbed truck (like image data).
 26: 
 27: You can't just stuff the fresh produce into a standard box – it would spoil! And the machinery won't even fit. You need specialized containers designed for specific types of cargo.
 28: 
 29: ![Standard Box vs Specialized Containers](https://img.icons8.com/plasticine/100/shipping-container.png) ![Standard Box vs Specialized Containers](https://img.icons8.com/plasticine/100/temperature-sensitive.png) ![Standard Box vs Specialized Containers](https://img.icons8.com/plasticine/100/image-file.png)
 30: 
 31: Similarly, our agents need a way to handle data beyond simple text strings. Using Python's built-in types directly (like a raw `PIL.Image` object for images) can cause problems:
 32: *   **How do you display it?** A raw image object doesn't automatically show up as a picture in a Jupyter notebook.
 33: *   **How do you save it?** How do you store an image or audio clip in the agent's text-based [Memory](04_agentmemory.md) log? You can't just put the raw image data there.
 34: *   **How do you pass it around?** How does the framework ensure different components (tools, agent core, memory) know how to handle these different data types consistently?
 35: 
 36: ## The Solution: Specialized Data Containers (`AgentType`)
 37: 
 38: `SmolaAgents` introduces special "data containers" to solve this problem. These are custom data types that inherit from a base `AgentType` class:
 39: 
 40: *   **`AgentText`**: For handling plain text. It behaves just like a standard Python string.
 41: *   **`AgentImage`**: For handling images (usually as `PIL.Image` objects).
 42: *   **`AgentAudio`**: For handling audio data (often as `torch.Tensor` or file paths).
 43: 
 44: Think of these as the specialized shipping containers:
 45: 
 46: *   `AgentText` is like the standard shipping box.
 47: *   `AgentImage` is like a container designed to safely transport and display pictures.
 48: *   `AgentAudio` is like a container designed to safely transport and play audio clips.
 49: 
 50: These `AgentType` objects **wrap** the actual data (the string, the image object, the audio data) but add extra capabilities.
 51: 
 52: ## Why Use `AgentType`? (The Benefits)
 53: 
 54: Using these specialized containers gives us several advantages:
 55: 
 56: 1.  **Consistent Handling:** The `SmolaAgents` framework knows how to recognize and work with `AgentType` objects, regardless of whether they contain text, images, or audio.
 57: 2.  **Smart Display:** Objects like `AgentImage` and `AgentAudio` know how to display themselves correctly in environments like Jupyter notebooks or Gradio interfaces. For example, an `AgentImage` will automatically render as an image, not just print `<PIL.Image.Image ...>`.
 58: 3.  **Proper Serialization:** They know how to convert themselves into a string representation suitable for logging or storing in [Memory](04_agentmemory.md).
 59:     *   `AgentText` simply returns its string content.
 60:     *   `AgentImage` automatically saves the image to a temporary file and returns the *path* to that file when converted to a string (`to_string()` method). This path can be safely logged.
 61:     *   `AgentAudio` does something similar for audio data, saving it to a temporary `.wav` file.
 62: 4.  **Clear Communication:** Tools can clearly state what type of output they produce (e.g., `output_type="image"`), and the framework ensures the output is wrapped correctly.
 63: 
 64: ## How is `AgentType` Used? (Mostly Automatic!)
 65: 
 66: The best part is that you often don't need to manually create or handle these `AgentType` objects. The framework does the heavy lifting.
 67: 
 68: **Scenario 1: A Tool Returning an Image**
 69: 
 70: Imagine you have a tool that generates images using a library like `diffusers`.
 71: 
 72: ```python
 73: # --- File: image_tool.py ---
 74: from smolagents import Tool
 75: from PIL import Image
 76: # Assume 'diffusion_pipeline' is a pre-loaded image generation model
 77: # from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
 78: # diffusion_pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(...)
 79: 
 80: class ImageGeneratorTool(Tool):
 81:     name: str = "image_generator"
 82:     description: str = "Generates an image based on a text prompt."
 83:     inputs: dict = {
 84:         "prompt": {
 85:             "type": "string",
 86:             "description": "The text description for the image."
 87:         }
 88:     }
 89:     # Tell the framework this tool outputs an image!
 90:     output_type: str = "image" # <--- Crucial Hint!
 91: 
 92:     def forward(self, prompt: str) -> Image.Image:
 93:         """Generates the image using a diffusion model."""
 94:         print(f"--- ImageGeneratorTool generating image for: '{prompt}' ---")
 95:         # image = diffusion_pipeline(prompt).images[0] # Actual generation
 96:         # For simplicity, let's create a dummy blank image
 97:         image = Image.new('RGB', (60, 30), color = 'red')
 98:         print(f"--- Tool returning a PIL Image object ---")
 99:         return image
100: 
101: # --- How the framework uses it (conceptual) ---
102: image_tool = ImageGeneratorTool()
103: prompt = "A red rectangle"
104: raw_output = image_tool(prompt=prompt) # Calls forward(), gets a PIL.Image object
105: 
106: # Framework automatically wraps the output because output_type="image"
107: # Uses handle_agent_output_types(raw_output, output_type="image")
108: from smolagents.agent_types import handle_agent_output_types
109: wrapped_output = handle_agent_output_types(raw_output, output_type="image")
110: 
111: print(f"Raw output type: {type(raw_output)}")
112: print(f"Wrapped output type: {type(wrapped_output)}")
113: 
114: # When storing in memory or logging, the framework calls to_string()
115: output_string = wrapped_output.to_string()
116: print(f"String representation for logs: {output_string}")
117: 
118: # Expected Output (path will vary):
119: # --- ImageGeneratorTool generating image for: 'A red rectangle' ---
120: # --- Tool returning a PIL Image object ---
121: # Raw output type: <class 'PIL.Image.Image'>
122: # Wrapped output type: <class 'smolagents.agent_types.AgentImage'>
123: # String representation for logs: /tmp/tmpxxxxxx/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.png
124: ```
125: 
126: **Explanation:**
127: 
128: 1.  We define `ImageGeneratorTool` and crucially set `output_type="image"`.
129: 2.  The `forward` method does its work and returns a standard `PIL.Image.Image` object.
130: 3.  When the agent framework receives this output, it checks the tool's `output_type`. Since it's `"image"`, it automatically uses the `handle_agent_output_types` function (or similar internal logic) to wrap the `PIL.Image.Image` object inside an `AgentImage` container.
131: 4.  If this `AgentImage` needs to be logged or stored in [Memory](04_agentmemory.md), the framework calls its `to_string()` method, which saves the image to a temporary file and returns the file path.
132: 
133: **Scenario 2: Passing an `AgentType` to a Tool**
134: 
135: What if an `AgentImage` object (maybe retrieved from memory or state) needs to be passed *into* another tool, perhaps one that analyzes images?
136: 
137: ```python
138: # --- File: image_analyzer_tool.py ---
139: from smolagents import Tool
140: from PIL import Image
141: from smolagents.agent_types import AgentImage, handle_agent_input_types
142: 
143: class ImageAnalyzerTool(Tool):
144:     name: str = "image_analyzer"
145:     description: str = "Analyzes an image and returns its dimensions."
146:     inputs: dict = {
147:         "input_image": {
148:             "type": "image", # Expects an image type
149:             "description": "The image to analyze."
150:         }
151:     }
152:     output_type: str = "string"
153: 
154:     def forward(self, input_image: Image.Image) -> str:
155:         """Analyzes the image."""
156:         # IMPORTANT: input_image here is ALREADY the raw PIL.Image object!
157:         print(f"--- ImageAnalyzerTool received image of type: {type(input_image)} ---")
158:         width, height = input_image.size
159:         return f"Image dimensions are {width}x{height}."
160: 
161: # --- How the framework uses it (conceptual) ---
162: analyzer_tool = ImageAnalyzerTool()
163: 
164: # Let's pretend 'agent_image_object' is an AgentImage retrieved from memory
165: # (It wraps a red PIL.Image.Image object like the one from Scenario 1)
166: agent_image_object = AgentImage(Image.new('RGB', (60, 30), color = 'red'))
167: print(f"Input object type: {type(agent_image_object)}")
168: 
169: # Framework automatically unwraps the input before calling 'forward'
170: # Uses handle_agent_input_types(input_image=agent_image_object)
171: # args_tuple, kwargs_dict = handle_agent_input_types(input_image=agent_image_object)
172: # result = analyzer_tool.forward(**kwargs_dict) # Simplified conceptual call
173: 
174: # Simulate the unwrapping and call:
175: raw_image = agent_image_object.to_raw() # Get the underlying PIL Image
176: result = analyzer_tool.forward(input_image=raw_image)
177: 
178: print(f"Analysis result: {result}")
179: 
180: # Expected Output:
181: # Input object type: <class 'smolagents.agent_types.AgentImage'>
182: # --- ImageAnalyzerTool received image of type: <class 'PIL.Image.Image'> ---
183: # Analysis result: Image dimensions are 60x30.
184: ```
185: 
186: **Explanation:**
187: 
188: 1.  `ImageAnalyzerTool` defines its input `input_image` as type `"image"`. Its `forward` method expects a standard `PIL.Image.Image`.
189: 2.  We have an `AgentImage` object (maybe from a previous step).
190: 3.  When the framework prepares to call `analyzer_tool.forward`, it sees that the input `agent_image_object` is an `AgentType`. It uses `handle_agent_input_types` (or similar logic) to automatically call the `.to_raw()` method on `agent_image_object`.
191: 4.  This `to_raw()` method extracts the underlying `PIL.Image.Image` object.
192: 5.  The framework passes this *raw* image object to the `forward` method. The tool developer doesn't need to worry about unwrapping the `AgentType` inside their tool logic.
193: 
194: ## Under the Hood: A Peek at the Code
195: 
196: Let's look at simplified versions of the `AgentType` classes and helper functions from `agent_types.py`.
197: 
198: *   **Base `AgentType` Class:**
199: 
200:     ```python
201:     # --- File: agent_types.py (Simplified AgentType) ---
202:     import logging
203:     logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
204: 
205:     class AgentType:
206:         """Abstract base class for custom agent data types."""
207:         def __init__(self, value):
208:             # Stores the actual data (string, PIL Image, etc.)
209:             self._value = value
210: 
211:         def __str__(self):
212:             # Default string conversion uses the to_string method
213:             return self.to_string()
214: 
215:         def to_raw(self):
216:             """Returns the underlying raw Python object."""
217:             logger.error("to_raw() called on base AgentType!")
218:             return self._value
219: 
220:         def to_string(self) -> str:
221:             """Returns a string representation suitable for logging/memory."""
222:             logger.error("to_string() called on base AgentType!")
223:             return str(self._value)
224: 
225:         # Other potential common methods...
226:     ```
227:     *   It holds the original `_value`.
228:     *   Defines the basic methods `to_raw` and `to_string` that subclasses will implement properly.
229: 
230: *   **`AgentImage` Implementation:**
231: 
232:     ```python
233:     # --- File: agent_types.py (Simplified AgentImage) ---

305:     *   It can be initialized with various image sources (PIL object, path, bytes).
306:     *   `to_raw()` ensures a PIL Image object is returned, loading from disk if necessary.
307:     *   `to_string()` saves the image to a temporary PNG file if it doesn't already have a path, and returns that path.
308:     *   `_ipython_display_` allows Jupyter notebooks to automatically display the image.
309:     *   It can delegate common image methods (like `.size`, `.save`) to the underlying raw image.
310: 
311: *   **Helper Functions (Conceptual):**
312: 
313:     ```python
314:     # --- File: agent_types.py / agents.py (Simplified Helpers) ---
315: 
316:     # Mapping from type name string to AgentType class
317:     _AGENT_TYPE_MAPPING = {"string": AgentText, "image": AgentImage, "audio": AgentAudio}
318: 
319:     def handle_agent_output_types(output: Any, output_type: Optional[str] = None) -> Any:
320:         """Wraps raw output into an AgentType if needed."""
321:         if output_type in _AGENT_TYPE_MAPPING:
322:             # If the tool explicitly defines output type (e.g., "image")
323:             wrapper_class = _AGENT_TYPE_MAPPING[output_type]
324:             return wrapper_class(output)
325:         else:

331:             # ... add checks for audio tensors etc. ...
332: 
333:             # Otherwise, return the output as is
334:             return output
335: 
336:     def handle_agent_input_types(*args, **kwargs) -> tuple[list, dict]:
337:         """Unwraps AgentType inputs into raw types before passing to a tool."""
338:         processed_args = []
339:         for arg in args:
340:             # If it's an AgentType instance, call to_raw(), otherwise keep as is
341:             processed_args.append(arg.to_raw() if isinstance(arg, AgentType) else arg)

346: 
347:         return tuple(processed_args), processed_kwargs
348:     ```
349:     *   `handle_agent_output_types` checks the tool's `output_type` or the actual Python type of the output and wraps it in the corresponding `AgentType` class (e.g., `AgentImage`).
350:     *   `handle_agent_input_types` iterates through arguments, checks if any are `AgentType` instances, and calls `.to_raw()` on them to get the underlying data before the tool's `forward` method is called.
351: 
352: ## Conclusion
353: 
354: `AgentType` (`AgentText`, `AgentImage`, `AgentAudio`) provides a crucial layer for handling diverse data types within the `SmolaAgents` framework. They act as specialized containers that ensure non-text data can be consistently processed, displayed correctly (especially in notebooks), and serialized appropriately for logging and memory.
355: 
356: You've learned:
357: 
358: *   Why standard Python types aren't always enough for agent inputs/outputs.
359: *   The "specialized shipping container" analogy for `AgentType`.
360: *   The benefits: consistent handling, smart display, and proper serialization (like saving images/audio to temp files).
361: *   How the framework automatically wraps tool outputs (`handle_agent_output_types`) and unwraps tool inputs (`handle_agent_input_types`).
362: *   Seen simplified code examples for `AgentImage` and the helper functions.
363: 
364: By using `AgentType`, `SmolaAgents` makes it much easier to build agents that can work seamlessly with multi-modal data like images and audio, without you having to manually handle the complexities of display and serialization in most cases.
365: 
366: Now that we understand how agents handle different data types, how can we keep track of everything the agent is doing, monitor its performance, and debug issues?

In [Chapter 7: AgentType](07_agenttype.md), we saw how `SmolaAgents` handles different kinds of data like text, images, and audio using specialized containers. Now that our agent can perform complex tasks ([Chapter 1: MultiStepAgent](01_multistepagent.md)), use various [Tools](03_tool.md), remember its progress ([Chapter 4: AgentMemory](04_agentmemory.md)), and even handle diverse data types, a new question arises: **How do we actually see what the agent is doing?**
 11: 
 12: What if the agent gets stuck in a loop? What if it uses the wrong tool or gives an unexpected answer? How can we peek inside its "mind" to understand its reasoning, track its actions, and maybe figure out what went wrong or how well it's performing?
 13: 
 14: ## The Problem: Flying Blind
 15: 
 16: Imagine driving a car with no dashboard. You wouldn't know your speed, fuel level, or if the engine was overheating. You'd be driving blind! Or imagine an airplane without its "black box" flight recorder – after an incident, it would be much harder to understand what happened.
 17: 
 18: ![Car with no dashboard](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/car--v1.png) ❓❓❓
 19: 
 20: Running an AI agent without visibility is similar. Without seeing its internal steps, thoughts, and actions, debugging problems or understanding its behavior becomes incredibly difficult. We need a way to observe the agent in real-time and record its performance.
 21: 
 22: ## The Solution: The Dashboard (`AgentLogger`) and Black Box (`Monitor`)
 23: 
 24: `SmolaAgents` provides two key components to give you this visibility:
 25: 
 26: 1.  **`AgentLogger` (The Dashboard):** This component provides **structured, real-time logging** of the agent's activities directly to your console (or wherever you run your Python script). It uses a library called `rich` to display colorful, formatted output, making it easy to follow:
 27:     *   Which step the agent is on.
 28:     *   The LLM's thoughts and the action it plans to take.
 29:     *   Which [Tool](03_tool.md) is being called and with what arguments.
 30:     *   The results (observations) from the tool.
 31:     *   Any errors encountered.
 32:     It's like watching the car's speedometer, fuel gauge, and warning lights as you drive.
 33: 
 34: 2.  **`Monitor` (The Black Box):** This component works quietly in the background, **tracking key performance metrics** during the agent's run. It records data like:
 35:     *   How long each step took (duration).
 36:     *   How many tokens the LLM used for input and output (if the [Model Interface](02_model_interface.md) provides this).
 37:     This data isn't usually displayed as prominently as the logger's output but is stored and can be used later for analysis, cost calculation, or identifying performance bottlenecks. It's like the airplane's flight data recorder.
 38: 
 39: Both `AgentLogger` and `Monitor` are automatically set up and used by the `MultiStepAgent`, making observation easy!
 40: 
 41: ## `AgentLogger`: Your Real-Time Dashboard
 42: 
 43: The `AgentLogger` is your primary window into the agent's live execution. It makes the **Think -> Act -> Observe** cycle visible.
 44: 
 45: **How It's Used (Automatic!)**
 46: 
 47: When you create a `MultiStepAgent`, it automatically creates an `AgentLogger` instance, usually stored in `self.logger`. Throughout the agent's `run` process, various methods within the agent call `self.logger` to print information:
 48: 
 49: *   `agent.run()` calls `self.logger.log_task()` to show the initial task.
 50: *   `agent._execute_step()` calls `self.logger.log_rule()` to mark the beginning of a new step.
 51: *   If the agent uses code (like `CodeAgent`), it calls `self.logger.log_code()` to show the code being executed.
 52: *   It logs tool calls using `self.logger.log()`.
 53: *   It logs observations using `self.logger.log()`.
 54: *   It logs errors using `self.logger.log_error()`.
 55: *   It logs the final answer using `self.logger.log()`.
 56: 
 57: **Example Output (Simulated)**
 58: 
 59: The `AgentLogger` uses `rich` to make the output colorful and easy to read. Here's a simplified idea of what you might see in your console for our "Capital and Weather" example:

 95: ```
 96: 
 97: *(Note: This is a conceptual representation. The exact formatting, colors, and details might vary. The "Thinking..." part is simulated; the logger typically shows the raw model output or parsed action.)*
 98: 
 99: **Log Levels**
100: 
101: You can control how much detail the logger shows using the `verbosity_level` parameter when creating the agent:
102: 
103: *   `LogLevel.INFO` (Default): Shows the main steps, tool calls, observations, final answer, and errors. Good for general use.
104: *   `LogLevel.DEBUG`: Shows everything `INFO` shows, plus the detailed LLM inputs/outputs and performance metrics from the `Monitor`. Useful for deep debugging.
105: *   `LogLevel.ERROR`: Only shows critical error messages.
106: *   `LogLevel.OFF`: Shows nothing.
107: 
108: ```python
109: from smolagents import CodeAgent
110: from smolagents.models import LiteLLMModel
111: from smolagents.monitoring import LogLevel # Import LogLevel

113: llm = LiteLLMModel(model_id="gpt-3.5-turbo")

224:     ```
225: 
226: ## `Monitor`: Your Performance Black Box
227: 
228: While the `AgentLogger` shows you *what* the agent is doing, the `Monitor` tracks *how well* it's doing it in terms of performance.
229: 
230: **How It's Used (Automatic!)**
231: 
232: The `MultiStepAgent` also creates a `Monitor` instance (`self.monitor`). The monitor's main job is done via its `update_metrics` method. This method is automatically added to a list of `step_callbacks` in the agent. At the end of every single step, the agent calls all functions in `step_callbacks`, including `self.monitor.update_metrics`.
233: 
234: Inside `update_metrics`, the monitor:
235: 1.  Accesses the `ActionStep` object for the just-completed step from [AgentMemory](04_agentmemory.md).
236: 2.  Reads the `duration` recorded in the `ActionStep`.
237: 3.  Accesses the agent's [Model Interface](02_model_interface.md) (`self.tracked_model`) to get the token counts (`last_input_token_count`, `last_output_token_count`) for the LLM call made during that step (if available).
238: 4.  Updates its internal totals (e.g., `total_input_token_count`).
239: 5.  Uses the `AgentLogger` (passed during initialization) to print these metrics, but typically only at the `DEBUG` log level, so they don't clutter the default `INFO` output.
240: 
241: **Example Output (at `DEBUG` level)**
242: 
243: If you run the agent with `verbosity_level=LogLevel.DEBUG`, you'll see the monitor's output added at the end of each step log:
244: 
245: ```console
246: [...]
247: INFO     Observations: Paris
248: DEBUG    [Step 1: Duration 1.52 seconds| Input tokens: 150 | Output tokens: 50]  # <-- Monitor Output
249: 
250: [...]
251: INFO     Observations: Sunny, 25°C
252: DEBUG    [Step 2: Duration 1.81 seconds| Input tokens: 210 | Output tokens: 105] # <-- Monitor Output
253: 
254: [...]
255: INFO     [bold #d4b702]Final answer:[/bold #d4b702] The capital of France is Paris, ...

349: ## Conclusion
350: 
351: The `AgentLogger` and `Monitor` are your essential tools for observing and understanding your `SmolaAgents`.
352: 
353: *   **`AgentLogger`** acts as the real-time dashboard, giving you formatted, colorful console output of the agent's steps, thoughts, actions, and errors, crucial for debugging and following along.
354: *   **`Monitor`** acts as the performance black box, tracking metrics like step duration and token usage, which are logged (usually at the `DEBUG` level) and useful for analysis and optimization.
355: 
356: You've learned:
357: 
358: *   Why visibility into agent execution is critical.
359: *   The roles of `AgentLogger` (dashboard) and `Monitor` (black box).
360: *   How they are automatically used by `MultiStepAgent`.
361: *   How `AgentLogger` provides readable, step-by-step output using `rich`.
362: *   How `Monitor` tracks performance metrics via step callbacks.
363: *   How to control log verbosity using `LogLevel`.
364: 
365: With these tools, you're no longer flying blind! You can confidently run your agents, watch them work, understand their performance, and diagnose issues when they arise.
366: 
367: This concludes our introductory tour of the core concepts in `SmolaAgents`. We hope these chapters have given you a solid foundation to start building your own intelligent agents. Happy coding!

12: `SmolaAgents`<sup>[View Repo](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/tree/076cca5e8a130d3fa2ff990ad630231b49767745/src/smolagents)</sup> is a project for building *autonomous agents* that can solve complex tasks.
13: The core component is the **MultiStepAgent**, which acts like a project manager. It uses a **Model Interface** to talk to language models (LLMs), employs **Tools** (like web search or code execution) to interact with the world or perform actions, and keeps track of its progress and conversation history using **AgentMemory**.
14: For agents that write and run Python code (`CodeAgent`), a **PythonExecutor** provides a safe environment. **PromptTemplates** help structure the instructions given to the LLM, while **AgentType** handles different data formats like images or audio. Finally, **AgentLogger & Monitor** provides logging and tracking for debugging and analysis.

 11: ## Requirements
 12: 
 13: > Notes for AI: Keep it simple and clear.
 14: > If the requirements are abstract, write concrete user stories
 15: 
 16: **User Story:** As a developer onboarding to a new codebase, I want a tutorial automatically generated from its GitHub repository or local directory, optionally in a specific language. This tutorial should explain the core abstractions, their relationships (visualized), and how they work together, using beginner-friendly language, analogies, and multi-line descriptions where needed, so I can understand the project structure and key concepts quickly without manually digging through all the code.
 17: 
 18: **Input:**
 19: - A publicly accessible GitHub repository URL or a local directory path.
 20: - A project name (optional, will be derived from the URL/directory if not provided).
 21: - Desired language for the tutorial (optional, defaults to English).
 22: 
 23: **Output:**
 24: - A directory named after the project containing:
 25:     - An `index.md` file with:
 26:         - A high-level project summary (potentially translated).
 27:         - A Mermaid flowchart diagram visualizing relationships between abstractions (using potentially translated names/labels).
 28:         - An ordered list of links to chapter files (using potentially translated names).
 29:     - Individual Markdown files for each chapter (`01_chapter_one.md`, `02_chapter_two.md`, etc.) detailing core abstractions in a logical order (potentially translated content).
 30: 
 31: ## Flow Design
 32: 
 33: > Notes for AI:
 34: > 1. Consider the design patterns of agent, map-reduce, rag, and workflow. Apply them if they fit.
 35: > 2. Present a concise, high-level description of the workflow.
 36: 
 37: ### Applicable Design Pattern:
 38: 
 39: This project primarily uses a **Workflow** pattern to decompose the tutorial generation process into sequential steps. The chapter writing step utilizes a **BatchNode** (a form of MapReduce) to process each abstraction individually.
 40: 
 41: 1.  **Workflow:** The overall process follows a defined sequence: fetch code -> identify abstractions -> analyze relationships -> determine order -> write chapters -> combine tutorial into files.
 42: 2.  **Batch Processing:** The `WriteChapters` node processes each identified abstraction independently (map) before the final tutorial files are structured (reduce).
 43: 
 44: ### Flow high-level Design:
 45: 
 46: 1.  **`FetchRepo`**: Crawls the specified GitHub repository URL or local directory using appropriate utility (`crawl_github_files` or `crawl_local_files`), retrieving relevant source code file contents.
 47: 2.  **`IdentifyAbstractions`**: Analyzes the codebase using an LLM to identify up to 10 core abstractions, generate beginner-friendly descriptions (potentially translated if language != English), and list the *indices* of files related to each abstraction.
 48: 3.  **`AnalyzeRelationships`**: Uses an LLM to analyze the identified abstractions (referenced by index) and their related code to generate a high-level project summary and describe the relationships/interactions between these abstractions (summary and labels potentially translated if language != English), specifying *source* and *target* abstraction indices and a concise label for each interaction.
 49: 4.  **`OrderChapters`**: Determines the most logical order (as indices) to present the abstractions in the tutorial, considering input context which might be translated. The output order itself is language-independent.
 50: 5.  **`WriteChapters` (BatchNode)**: Iterates through the ordered list of abstraction indices. For each abstraction, it calls an LLM to write a detailed, beginner-friendly chapter (content potentially fully translated if language != English), using the relevant code files (accessed via indices) and summaries of previously generated chapters (potentially translated) as context.
 51: 6.  **`CombineTutorial`**: Creates an output directory, generates a Mermaid diagram from the relationship data (using potentially translated names/labels), and writes the project summary (potentially translated), relationship diagram, chapter links (using potentially translated names), and individually generated chapter files (potentially translated content) into it. Fixed text like "Chapters", "Source Repository", and the attribution footer remain in English.
 52: 
 53: ```mermaid
 54: flowchart TD
 55:     A[FetchRepo] --> B[IdentifyAbstractions];
 56:     B --> C[AnalyzeRelationships];
 57:     C --> D[OrderChapters];
 58:     D --> E[Batch WriteChapters];
 59:     E --> F[CombineTutorial];
 60: ```
 61: 
 62: ## Utility Functions
 63: 
 64: > Notes for AI:
 65: > 1. Understand the utility function definition thoroughly by reviewing the doc.
 66: > 2. Include only the necessary utility functions, based on nodes in the flow.
 67: 
 68: 1.  **`crawl_github_files`** (`utils/crawl_github_files.py`) - *External Dependency: requests, gitpython (optional for SSH)*
 69:     *   *Input*: `repo_url` (str), `token` (str, optional), `max_file_size` (int, optional), `use_relative_paths` (bool, optional), `include_patterns` (set, optional), `exclude_patterns` (set, optional)
 70:     *   *Output*: `dict` containing `files` (dict[str, str]) and `stats`.
 71:     *   *Necessity*: Required by `FetchRepo` to download and read source code from GitHub if a `repo_url` is provided. Handles API calls or SSH cloning, filtering, and file reading.
 72: 2.  **`crawl_local_files`** (`utils/crawl_local_files.py`) - *External Dependency: None*
 73:     *   *Input*: `directory` (str), `max_file_size` (int, optional), `use_relative_paths` (bool, optional), `include_patterns` (set, optional), `exclude_patterns` (set, optional)
 74:     *   *Output*: `dict` containing `files` (dict[str, str]).
 75:     *   *Necessity*: Required by `FetchRepo` to read source code from a local directory if a `local_dir` path is provided. Handles directory walking, filtering, and file reading.
 76: 3.  **`call_llm`** (`utils/call_llm.py`) - *External Dependency: LLM Provider API (e.g., Google GenAI)*
 77:     *   *Input*: `prompt` (str), `use_cache` (bool, optional)
 78:     *   *Output*: `response` (str)
 79:     *   *Necessity*: Used by `IdentifyAbstractions`, `AnalyzeRelationships`, `OrderChapters`, and `WriteChapters` for code analysis and content generation. Needs careful prompt engineering and YAML validation (implicit via `yaml.safe_load` which raises errors).
 80: 
 81: ## Node Design
 82: 
 83: ### Shared Store
 84: 
 85: > Notes for AI: Try to minimize data redundancy
 86: 
 87: The shared Store structure is organized as follows:
 88: 
 89: ```python
 90: shared = {
 91:     # --- Inputs ---
 92:     "repo_url": None, # Provided by the user/main script if using GitHub
 93:     "local_dir": None, # Provided by the user/main script if using local directory
 94:     "project_name": None, # Optional, derived from repo_url/local_dir if not provided
 95:     "github_token": None, # Optional, from argument or environment variable
 96:     "output_dir": "output", # Default or user-specified base directory for output
 97:     "include_patterns": set(), # File patterns to include
 98:     "exclude_patterns": set(), # File patterns to exclude
 99:     "max_file_size": 100000, # Default or user-specified max file size
100:     "language": "english", # Default or user-specified language for the tutorial
101: 
102:     # --- Intermediate/Output Data ---
103:     "files": [], # Output of FetchRepo: List of tuples (file_path: str, file_content: str)
104:     "abstractions": [], # Output of IdentifyAbstractions: List of {"name": str (potentially translated), "description": str (potentially translated), "files": [int]} (indices into shared["files"])
105:     "relationships": { # Output of AnalyzeRelationships
106:          "summary": None, # Overall project summary (potentially translated)
107:          "details": [] # List of {"from": int, "to": int, "label": str (potentially translated)} describing relationships between abstraction indices.
108:      },
109:     "chapter_order": [], # Output of OrderChapters: List of indices into shared["abstractions"], determining tutorial order
110:     "chapters": [], # Output of WriteChapters: List of chapter content strings (Markdown, potentially translated), ordered according to chapter_order
111:     "final_output_dir": None # Output of CombineTutorial: Path to the final generated tutorial directory (e.g., "output/my_project")
112: }
113: ```
114: 
115: ### Node Steps
116: 
117: > Notes for AI: Carefully decide whether to use Batch/Async Node/Flow. Removed explicit try/except in exec, relying on Node's built-in fault tolerance.
118: 
119: 1.  **`FetchRepo`**
120:     *   *Purpose*: Download the repository code (from GitHub) or read from a local directory, loading relevant files into memory using the appropriate crawler utility.
121:     *   *Type*: Regular
122:     *   *Steps*:
123:         *   `prep`: Read `repo_url`, `local_dir`, `project_name`, `github_token`, `output_dir`, `include_patterns`, `exclude_patterns`, `max_file_size` from shared store. Determine `project_name` from `repo_url` or `local_dir` if not present in shared. Set `use_relative_paths` flag.
124:         *   `exec`: If `repo_url` is present, call `crawl_github_files(...)`. Otherwise, call `crawl_local_files(...)`. Convert the resulting `files` dictionary into a list of `(path, content)` tuples.
125:         *   `post`: Write the list of `files` tuples and the derived `project_name` (if applicable) to the shared store.
126: 
127: 2.  **`IdentifyAbstractions`**
128:     *   *Purpose*: Analyze the code to identify key concepts/abstractions using indices. Generates potentially translated names and descriptions if language is not English.
129:     *   *Type*: Regular
130:     *   *Steps*:
131:         *   `prep`: Read `files` (list of tuples), `project_name`, and `language` from shared store. Create context using `create_llm_context` helper which adds file indices. Format the list of `index # path` for the prompt.
132:         *   `exec`: Construct a prompt for `call_llm`. If language is not English, add instructions to generate `name` and `description` in the target language. Ask LLM to identify ~5-10 core abstractions, provide a simple description for each, and list the relevant *file indices* (e.g., `- 0 # path/to/file.py`). Request YAML list output. Parse and validate the YAML, ensuring indices are within bounds and converting entries like `0 # path...` to just the integer `0`.
133:         *   `post`: Write the validated list of `abstractions` (e.g., `[{"name": "Node", "description": "...", "files": [0, 3, 5]}, ...]`) containing file *indices* and potentially translated `name`/`description` to the shared store.
134: 
135: 3.  **`AnalyzeRelationships`**
136:     *   *Purpose*: Generate a project summary and describe how the identified abstractions interact using indices and concise labels. Generates potentially translated summary and labels if language is not English.
137:     *   *Type*: Regular
138:     *   *Steps*:
139:         *   `prep`: Read `abstractions`, `files`, `project_name`, and `language` from shared store. Format context for the LLM, including potentially translated abstraction names *and indices*, potentially translated descriptions, and content snippets from related files (referenced by `index # path` using `get_content_for_indices` helper). Prepare the list of `index # AbstractionName` (potentially translated) for the prompt.
140:         *   `exec`: Construct a prompt for `call_llm`. If language is not English, add instructions to generate `summary` and `label` in the target language, and note that input names might be translated. Ask for (1) a high-level summary and (2) a list of relationships, each specifying `from_abstraction` (e.g., `0 # Abstraction1`), `to_abstraction` (e.g., `1 # Abstraction2`), and a concise `label`. Request structured YAML output. Parse and validate, converting referenced abstractions to indices (`from: 0, to: 1`).
141:         *   `post`: Parse the LLM response and write the `relationships` dictionary (`{"summary": "...", "details": [{"from": 0, "to": 1, "label": "..."}, ...]}`) with indices and potentially translated `summary`/`label` to the shared store.
142: 
143: 4.  **`OrderChapters`**
144:     *   *Purpose*: Determine the sequence (as indices) in which abstractions should be presented. Considers potentially translated input context.
145:     *   *Type*: Regular
146:     *   *Steps*:
147:         *   `prep`: Read `abstractions`, `relationships`, `project_name`, and `language` from the shared store. Prepare context including the list of `index # AbstractionName` (potentially translated) and textual descriptions of relationships referencing indices and using the potentially translated `label`. Note in context if summary/names might be translated.
148:         *   `exec`: Construct a prompt for `call_llm` asking it to order the abstractions based on importance, foundational concepts, or dependencies. Request output as an ordered YAML list of `index # AbstractionName`. Parse and validate, extracting only the indices and ensuring all are present exactly once.
149:         *   `post`: Write the validated ordered list of indices (`chapter_order`) to the shared store.
150: 
151: 5.  **`WriteChapters`**
152:     *   *Purpose*: Generate the detailed content for each chapter of the tutorial. Generates potentially fully translated chapter content if language is not English.
153:     *   *Type*: **BatchNode**
154:     *   *Steps*:
155:         *   `prep`: Read `chapter_order` (indices), `abstractions`, `files`, `project_name`, and `language` from shared store. Initialize an empty instance variable `self.chapters_written_so_far`. Return an iterable list where each item corresponds to an *abstraction index* from `chapter_order`. Each item should contain chapter number, potentially translated abstraction details, a map of related file content (`{ "idx # path": content }`), full chapter listing (potentially translated names), chapter filename map, previous/next chapter info (potentially translated names), and language.
156:         *   `exec(item)`: Construct a prompt for `call_llm`. If language is not English, add detailed instructions to write the *entire* chapter in the target language, translating explanations, examples, etc., while noting which input context might already be translated. Ask LLM to write a beginner-friendly Markdown chapter. Provide potentially translated concept details. Include a summary of previously written chapters (potentially translated). Provide relevant code snippets. Add the generated (potentially translated) chapter content to `self.chapters_written_so_far` for the next iteration's context. Return the chapter content.
157:         *   `post(shared, prep_res, exec_res_list)`: `exec_res_list` contains the generated chapter Markdown content strings (potentially translated), ordered correctly. Assign this list directly to `shared["chapters"]`. Clean up `self.chapters_written_so_far`.
158: 
159: 6.  **`CombineTutorial`**
160:     *   *Purpose*: Assemble the final tutorial files, including a Mermaid diagram using potentially translated labels/names. Fixed text remains English.
161:     *   *Type*: Regular
162:     *   *Steps*:
163:         *   `prep`: Read `project_name`, `relationships` (potentially translated summary/labels), `chapter_order` (indices), `abstractions` (potentially translated name/desc), `chapters` (list of potentially translated content), `repo_url`, and `output_dir` from shared store. Generate a Mermaid `flowchart TD` string based on `relationships["details"]`, using indices to identify nodes (potentially translated names) and the concise `label` (potentially translated) for edges. Construct the content for `index.md` (including potentially translated summary, Mermaid diagram, and ordered links to chapters using potentially translated names derived using `chapter_order` and `abstractions`). Define the output directory path (e.g., `./output_dir/project_name`). Prepare a list of `{ "filename": "01_...", "content": "..." }` for chapters, adding the English attribution footer to each chapter's content. Add the English attribution footer to the index content.
164:         *   `exec`: Create the output directory. Write the generated `index.md` content. Iterate through the prepared chapter file list and write each chapter's content to its corresponding `.md` file in the output directory.
165:         *   `post`: Write the final `output_path` to `shared["final_output_dir"]`. Log completion.

   6: # Agentic Coding: Humans Design, Agents code!
   7: 
   8: > If you are an AI agents involved in building LLM Systems, read this guide **VERY, VERY** carefully! This is the most important chapter in the entire document. Throughout development, you should always (1) start with a small and simple solution, (2) design at a high level (`docs/design.md`) before implementation, and (3) frequently ask humans for feedback and clarification.
   9: {: .warning }
  10: 
  11: ## Agentic Coding Steps
  12: 
  13: Agentic Coding should be a collaboration between Human System Design and Agent Implementation:
  14: 
  15: | Steps                  | Human      | AI        | Comment                                                                 |
  16: |:-----------------------|:----------:|:---------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  17: | 1. Requirements | ★★★ High  | ★☆☆ Low   | Humans understand the requirements and context.                    |
  18: | 2. Flow          | ★★☆ Medium | ★★☆ Medium |  Humans specify the high-level design, and the AI fills in the details. |
  19: | 3. Utilities   | ★★☆ Medium | ★★☆ Medium | Humans provide available external APIs and integrations, and the AI helps with implementation. |
  20: | 4. Node          | ★☆☆ Low   | ★★★ High  | The AI helps design the node types and data handling based on the flow.          |
  21: | 5. Implementation      | ★☆☆ Low   | ★★★ High  |  The AI implements the flow based on the design. |
  22: | 6. Optimization        | ★★☆ Medium | ★★☆ Medium | Humans evaluate the results, and the AI helps optimize. |
  23: | 7. Reliability         | ★☆☆ Low   | ★★★ High  |  The AI writes test cases and addresses corner cases.     |
  24: 
  25: 1. **Requirements**: Clarify the requirements for your project, and evaluate whether an AI system is a good fit. 
  26:     - Understand AI systems' strengths and limitations:
  27:       - **Good for**: Routine tasks requiring common sense (filling forms, replying to emails)
  28:       - **Good for**: Creative tasks with well-defined inputs (building slides, writing SQL)
  29:       - **Not good for**: Ambiguous problems requiring complex decision-making (business strategy, startup planning)
  30:     - **Keep It User-Centric:** Explain the "problem" from the user's perspective rather than just listing features.
  31:     - **Balance complexity vs. impact**: Aim to deliver the highest value features with minimal complexity early.
  32: 
  33: 2. **Flow Design**: Outline at a high level, describe how your AI system orchestrates nodes.
  34:     - Identify applicable design patterns (e.g., [Map Reduce](./design_pattern/mapreduce.md), [Agent](./design_pattern/agent.md), [RAG](./design_pattern/rag.md)).
  35:       - For each node in the flow, start with a high-level one-line description of what it does.
  36:       - If using **Map Reduce**, specify how to map (what to split) and how to reduce (how to combine).
  37:       - If using **Agent**, specify what are the inputs (context) and what are the possible actions.
  38:       - If using **RAG**, specify what to embed, noting that there's usually both offline (indexing) and online (retrieval) workflows.
  39:     - Outline the flow and draw it in a mermaid diagram. For example:
  40:       ```mermaid
  41:       flowchart LR
  42:           start[Start] --> batch[Batch]
  43:           batch --> check[Check]
  44:           check -->|OK| process
  45:           check -->|Error| fix[Fix]
  46:           fix --> check
  47:           
  48:           subgraph process[Process]
  49:             step1[Step 1] --> step2[Step 2]
  50:           end
  51:           
  52:           process --> endNode[End]
  53:       ```
  54:     - > **If Humans can't specify the flow, AI Agents can't automate it!** Before building an LLM system, thoroughly understand the problem and potential solution by manually solving example inputs to develop intuition.  
  55:       {: .best-practice }
  56: 
  57: 3. **Utilities**: Based on the Flow Design, identify and implement necessary utility functions.
  58:     - Think of your AI system as the brain. It needs a body—these *external utility functions*—to interact with the real world:
  59:         <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/utility.png?raw=true" width="400"/></div>
  60: 
  61:         - Reading inputs (e.g., retrieving Slack messages, reading emails)
  62:         - Writing outputs (e.g., generating reports, sending emails)
  63:         - Using external tools (e.g., calling LLMs, searching the web)
  64:         - **NOTE**: *LLM-based tasks* (e.g., summarizing text, analyzing sentiment) are **NOT** utility functions; rather, they are *core functions* internal in the AI system.
  65:     - For each utility function, implement it and write a simple test.
  66:     - Document their input/output, as well as why they are necessary. For example:
  67:       - `name`: `get_embedding` (`utils/get_embedding.py`)
  68:       - `input`: `str`
  69:       - `output`: a vector of 3072 floats
  70:       - `necessity`: Used by the second node to embed text
  71:     - Example utility implementation:
  72:       ```python
  73:       # utils/call_llm.py
  74:       from openai import OpenAI
  75: 
  76:       def call_llm(prompt):    
  77:           client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
  78:           r = client.chat.completions.create(
  79:               model="gpt-4o",
  80:               messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
  81:           )
  82:           return r.choices[0].message.content
  83:           
  84:       if __name__ == "__main__":
  85:           prompt = "What is the meaning of life?"
  86:           print(call_llm(prompt))
  87:       ```
  88:     - > **Sometimes, design Utilies before Flow:**  For example, for an LLM project to automate a legacy system, the bottleneck will likely be the available interface to that system. Start by designing the hardest utilities for interfacing, and then build the flow around them.
  89:       {: .best-practice }
  90: 
  91: 4. **Node Design**: Plan how each node will read and write data, and use utility functions.
  92:    - One core design principle for PocketFlow is to use a [shared store](./core_abstraction/communication.md), so start with a shared store design:
  93:       - For simple systems, use an in-memory dictionary.
  94:       - For more complex systems or when persistence is required, use a database.
  95:       - **Don't Repeat Yourself**: Use in-memory references or foreign keys.
  96:       - Example shared store design:
  97:         ```python
  98:         shared = {
  99:             "user": {
 100:                 "id": "user123",
 101:                 "context": {                # Another nested dict
 102:                     "weather": {"temp": 72, "condition": "sunny"},
 103:                     "location": "San Francisco"
 104:                 }
 105:             },
 106:             "results": {}                   # Empty dict to store outputs
 107:         }
 108:         ```
 109:    - For each [Node](./core_abstraction/node.md), describe its type, how it reads and writes data, and which utility function it uses. Keep it specific but high-level without codes. For example:
 110:      - `type`: Regular (or Batch, or Async)
 111:      - `prep`: Read "text" from the shared store
 112:      - `exec`: Call the embedding utility function
 113:      - `post`: Write "embedding" to the shared store
 114: 
 115: 5. **Implementation**: Implement the initial nodes and flows based on the design.
 116:    - 🎉 If you've reached this step, humans have finished the design. Now *Agentic Coding* begins!
 117:    - **"Keep it simple, stupid!"** Avoid complex features and full-scale type checking.
 118:    - **FAIL FAST**! Avoid `try` logic so you can quickly identify any weak points in the system.
 119:    - Add logging throughout the code to facilitate debugging.
 120: 
 121: 7. **Optimization**:
 122:    - **Use Intuition**: For a quick initial evaluation, human intuition is often a good start.
 123:    - **Redesign Flow (Back to Step 3)**: Consider breaking down tasks further, introducing agentic decisions, or better managing input contexts.
 124:    - If your flow design is already solid, move on to micro-optimizations:
 125:      - **Prompt Engineering**: Use clear, specific instructions with examples to reduce ambiguity.
 126:      - **In-Context Learning**: Provide robust examples for tasks that are difficult to specify with instructions alone.
 127: 
 128:    - > **You'll likely iterate a lot!** Expect to repeat Steps 3–6 hundreds of times.
 129:      >
 130:      > <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/success.png?raw=true" width="400"/></div>
 131:      {: .best-practice }
 132: 
 133: 8. **Reliability**  
 134:    - **Node Retries**: Add checks in the node `exec` to ensure outputs meet requirements, and consider increasing `max_retries` and `wait` times.
 135:    - **Logging and Visualization**: Maintain logs of all attempts and visualize node results for easier debugging.
 136:    - **Self-Evaluation**: Add a separate node (powered by an LLM) to review outputs when results are uncertain.

 138: ## Example LLM Project File Structure
 139: 
 140: ```
 141: my_project/
 142: ├── main.py
 143: ├── nodes.py
 144: ├── flow.py
 145: ├── utils/
 146: │   ├── __init__.py
 147: │   ├── call_llm.py
 148: │   └── search_web.py
 149: ├── requirements.txt
 150: └── docs/
 151:     └── design.md
 152: ```
 153: 
 154: - **`docs/design.md`**: Contains project documentation for each step above. This should be *high-level* and *no-code*.
 155: - **`utils/`**: Contains all utility functions.
 156:   - It's recommended to dedicate one Python file to each API call, for example `call_llm.py` or `search_web.py`.
 157:   - Each file should also include a `main()` function to try that API call
 158: - **`nodes.py`**: Contains all the node definitions.
 159:   ```python
 160:   # nodes.py
 161:   from pocketflow import Node
 162:   from utils.call_llm import call_llm
 163: 
 164:   class GetQuestionNode(Node):
 165:       def exec(self, _):
 166:           # Get question directly from user input
 167:           user_question = input("Enter your question: ")
 168:           return user_question
 169:       
 170:       def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 171:           # Store the user's question
 172:           shared["question"] = exec_res
 173:           return "default"  # Go to the next node
 174: 
 175:   class AnswerNode(Node):
 176:       def prep(self, shared):
 177:           # Read question from shared
 178:           return shared["question"]
 179:       
 180:       def exec(self, question):
 181:           # Call LLM to get the answer
 182:           return call_llm(question)
 183:       
 184:       def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 185:           # Store the answer in shared
 186:           shared["answer"] = exec_res
 187:   ```
 188: - **`flow.py`**: Implements functions that create flows by importing node definitions and connecting them.
 189:   ```python
 190:   # flow.py
 191:   from pocketflow import Flow
 192:   from nodes import GetQuestionNode, AnswerNode
 193:

 196:       # Create nodes
 197:       get_question_node = GetQuestionNode()
 198:       answer_node = AnswerNode()
 199:       
 200:       # Connect nodes in sequence
 201:       get_question_node >> answer_node
 202:       
 203:       # Create flow starting with input node
 204:       return Flow(start=get_question_node)
 205:   ```
 206: - **`main.py`**: Serves as the project's entry point.
 207:   ```python
 208:   # main.py
 209:   from flow import create_qa_flow
 210: 
 211:   # Example main function
 212:   # Please replace this with your own main function
 213:   def main():
 214:       shared = {
 215:           "question": None,  # Will be populated by GetQuestionNode from user input
 216:           "answer": None     # Will be populated by AnswerNode
 217:       }
 218: 
 219:       # Create the flow and run it
 220:       qa_flow = create_qa_flow()
 221:       qa_flow.run(shared)
 222:       print(f"Question: {shared['question']}")
 223:       print(f"Answer: {shared['answer']}")
 224: 
 225:   if __name__ == "__main__":

 238: # Pocket Flow
 239: 
 240: A [100-line](https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/blob/main/pocketflow/__init__.py) minimalist LLM framework for *Agents, Task Decomposition, RAG, etc*.
 241: 
 242: - **Lightweight**: Just the core graph abstraction in 100 lines. ZERO dependencies, and vendor lock-in.
 243: - **Expressive**: Everything you love from larger frameworks—([Multi-](./design_pattern/multi_agent.html))[Agents](./design_pattern/agent.html), [Workflow](./design_pattern/workflow.html), [RAG](./design_pattern/rag.html), and more.  
 244: - **Agentic-Coding**: Intuitive enough for AI agents to help humans build complex LLM applications.
 245: 
 246: <div align="center">
 247:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/meme.jpg?raw=true" width="400"/>
 248: </div>
 249: 
 250: ## Core Abstraction
 251: 
 252: We model the LLM workflow as a **Graph + Shared Store**:
 253: 
 254: - [Node](./core_abstraction/node.md) handles simple (LLM) tasks.
 255: - [Flow](./core_abstraction/flow.md) connects nodes through **Actions** (labeled edges).
 256: - [Shared Store](./core_abstraction/communication.md) enables communication between nodes within flows.
 257: - [Batch](./core_abstraction/batch.md) nodes/flows allow for data-intensive tasks.
 258: - [Async](./core_abstraction/async.md) nodes/flows allow waiting for asynchronous tasks.
 259: - [(Advanced) Parallel](./core_abstraction/parallel.md) nodes/flows handle I/O-bound tasks.
 260: 
 261: <div align="center">
 262:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/abstraction.png" width="500"/>
 263: </div>
 264: 
 265: ## Design Pattern
 266: 
 267: From there, it’s easy to implement popular design patterns:
 268: 
 269: - [Agent](./design_pattern/agent.md) autonomously makes decisions.
 270: - [Workflow](./design_pattern/workflow.md) chains multiple tasks into pipelines.
 271: - [RAG](./design_pattern/rag.md) integrates data retrieval with generation.
 272: - [Map Reduce](./design_pattern/mapreduce.md) splits data tasks into Map and Reduce steps.
 273: - [Structured Output](./design_pattern/structure.md) formats outputs consistently.
 274: - [(Advanced) Multi-Agents](./design_pattern/multi_agent.md) coordinate multiple agents.
 275: 
 276: <div align="center">
 277:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/design.png" width="500"/>
 278: </div>
 279: 
 280: ## Utility Function
 281: 
 282: We **do not** provide built-in utilities. Instead, we offer *examples*—please *implement your own*:
 283: 
 284: - [LLM Wrapper](./utility_function/llm.md)
 285: - [Viz and Debug](./utility_function/viz.md)
 286: - [Web Search](./utility_function/websearch.md)
 287: - [Chunking](./utility_function/chunking.md)
 288: - [Embedding](./utility_function/embedding.md)
 289: - [Vector Databases](./utility_function/vector.md)
 290: - [Text-to-Speech](./utility_function/text_to_speech.md)
 291: 
 292: **Why not built-in?**: I believe it's a *bad practice* for vendor-specific APIs in a general framework:
 293: - *API Volatility*: Frequent changes lead to heavy maintenance for hardcoded APIs.
 294: - *Flexibility*: You may want to switch vendors, use fine-tuned models, or run them locally.
 295: - *Optimizations*: Prompt caching, batching, and streaming are easier without vendor lock-in.

 314: 
 315: 1. **prep_async()**: For *fetching/reading data (files, APIs, DB)* in an I/O-friendly way.
 316: 2. **exec_async()**: Typically used for async LLM calls.
 317: 3. **post_async()**: For *awaiting user feedback*, *coordinating across multi-agents* or any additional async steps after `exec_async()`.
 318: 
 319: **Note**: `AsyncNode` must be wrapped in `AsyncFlow`. `AsyncFlow` can also include regular (sync) nodes.
 320: 
 321: ### Example
 322: 
 323: ```python
 324: class SummarizeThenVerify(AsyncNode):
 325:     async def prep_async(self, shared):
 326:         # Example: read a file asynchronously
 327:         doc_text = await read_file_async(shared["doc_path"])
 328:         return doc_text
 329: 
 330:     async def exec_async(self, prep_res):
 331:         # Example: async LLM call
 332:         summary = await call_llm_async(f"Summarize: {prep_res}")
 333:         return summary
 334: 
 335:     async def post_async(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 336:         # Example: wait for user feedback
 337:         decision = await gather_user_feedback(exec_res)
 338:         if decision == "approve":
 339:             shared["summary"] = exec_res
 340:             return "approve"
 341:         return "deny"
 342: 
 343: summarize_node = SummarizeThenVerify()
 344: final_node = Finalize()
 345: 
 346: # Define transitions
 347: summarize_node - "approve" >> final_node
 348: summarize_node - "deny"    >> summarize_node  # retry
 349: 
 350: flow = AsyncFlow(start=summarize_node)
 351: 
 352: async def main():
 353:     shared = {"doc_path": "document.txt"}
 354:     await flow.run_async(shared)
 355:     print("Final Summary:", shared.get("summary"))
 356: 
 357: asyncio.run(main())

 369: 
 370: # Batch
 371: 
 372: **Batch** makes it easier to handle large inputs in one Node or **rerun** a Flow multiple times. Example use cases:
 373: - **Chunk-based** processing (e.g., splitting large texts).
 374: - **Iterative** processing over lists of input items (e.g., user queries, files, URLs).
 375: 
 376: ## 1. BatchNode
 377: 
 378: A **BatchNode** extends `Node` but changes `prep()` and `exec()`:
 379: 
 380: - **`prep(shared)`**: returns an **iterable** (e.g., list, generator).
 381: - **`exec(item)`**: called **once** per item in that iterable.
 382: - **`post(shared, prep_res, exec_res_list)`**: after all items are processed, receives a **list** of results (`exec_res_list`) and returns an **Action**.
 383: 
 384: 
 385: ### Example: Summarize a Large File
 386: 
 387: ```python
 388: class MapSummaries(BatchNode):
 389:     def prep(self, shared):
 390:         # Suppose we have a big file; chunk it
 391:         content = shared["data"]
 392:         chunk_size = 10000
 393:         chunks = [content[i:i+chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(content), chunk_size)]
 394:         return chunks
 395: 
 396:     def exec(self, chunk):
 397:         prompt = f"Summarize this chunk in 10 words: {chunk}"
 398:         summary = call_llm(prompt)
 399:         return summary
 400: 
 401:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list):
 402:         combined = "\n".join(exec_res_list)
 403:         shared["summary"] = combined
 404:         return "default"
 405: 
 406: map_summaries = MapSummaries()
 407: flow = Flow(start=map_summaries)
 408: flow.run(shared)
 409: ```
 410: 
 411: ---
 412: 
 413: ## 2. BatchFlow
 414: 
 415: A **BatchFlow** runs a **Flow** multiple times, each time with different `params`. Think of it as a loop that replays the Flow for each parameter set.
 416: 
 417: ### Example: Summarize Many Files
 418: 
 419: ```python
 420: class SummarizeAllFiles(BatchFlow):
 421:     def prep(self, shared):
 422:         # Return a list of param dicts (one per file)
 423:         filenames = list(shared["data"].keys())  # e.g., ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", ...]
 424:         return [{"filename": fn} for fn in filenames]
 425: 
 426: # Suppose we have a per-file Flow (e.g., load_file >> summarize >> reduce):
 427: summarize_file = SummarizeFile(start=load_file)
 428: 
 429: # Wrap that flow into a BatchFlow:
 430: summarize_all_files = SummarizeAllFiles(start=summarize_file)
 431: summarize_all_files.run(shared)
 432: ```
 433: 
 434: ### Under the Hood
 435: 1. `prep(shared)` returns a list of param dicts—e.g., `[{filename: "file1.txt"}, {filename: "file2.txt"}, ...]`.
 436: 2. The **BatchFlow** loops through each dict. For each one:
 437:    - It merges the dict with the BatchFlow’s own `params`.
 438:    - It calls `flow.run(shared)` using the merged result.
 439: 3. This means the sub-Flow is run **repeatedly**, once for every param dict.
 440: 
 441: ---
 442: 
 443: ## 3. Nested or Multi-Level Batches
 444: 
 445: You can nest a **BatchFlow** in another **BatchFlow**. For instance:
 446: - **Outer** batch: returns a list of diretory param dicts (e.g., `{"directory": "/pathA"}`, `{"directory": "/pathB"}`, ...).
 447: - **Inner** batch: returning a list of per-file param dicts.
 448: 
 449: At each level, **BatchFlow** merges its own param dict with the parent’s. By the time you reach the **innermost** node, the final `params` is the merged result of **all** parents in the chain. This way, a nested structure can keep track of the entire context (e.g., directory + file name) at once.
 450: 
 451: ```python
 452: 
 453: class FileBatchFlow(BatchFlow):
 454:     def prep(self, shared):
 455:         directory = self.params["directory"]
 456:         # e.g., files = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", ...]
 457:         files = [f for f in os.listdir(directory) if f.endswith(".txt")]
 458:         return [{"filename": f} for f in files]
 459: 
 460: class DirectoryBatchFlow(BatchFlow):
 461:     def prep(self, shared):
 462:         directories = [ "/path/to/dirA", "/path/to/dirB"]
 463:         return [{"directory": d} for d in directories]
 464: 
 465: # MapSummaries have params like {"directory": "/path/to/dirA", "filename": "file1.txt"}
 466: inner_flow = FileBatchFlow(start=MapSummaries())
 467: outer_flow = DirectoryBatchFlow(start=inner_flow)
 468: ```

 480: # Communication
 481: 
 482: Nodes and Flows **communicate** in 2 ways:
 483: 
 484: 1. **Shared Store (for almost all the cases)** 
 485: 
 486:    - A global data structure (often an in-mem dict) that all nodes can read ( `prep()`) and write (`post()`).  
 487:    - Great for data results, large content, or anything multiple nodes need.
 488:    - You shall design the data structure and populate it ahead.
 489:      
 490:    - > **Separation of Concerns:** Use `Shared Store` for almost all cases to separate *Data Schema* from *Compute Logic*!  This approach is both flexible and easy to manage, resulting in more maintainable code. `Params` is more a syntax sugar for [Batch](./batch.md).
 491:      {: .best-practice }
 492: 
 493: 2. **Params (only for [Batch](./batch.md))** 
 494:    - Each node has a local, ephemeral `params` dict passed in by the **parent Flow**, used as an identifier for tasks. Parameter keys and values shall be **immutable**.
 495:    - Good for identifiers like filenames or numeric IDs, in Batch mode.
 496: 
 497: If you know memory management, think of the **Shared Store** like a **heap** (shared by all function calls), and **Params** like a **stack** (assigned by the caller).
 498: 
 499: ---
 500: 
 501: ## 1. Shared Store
 502: 
 503: ### Overview
 504: 
 505: A shared store is typically an in-mem dictionary, like:
 506: ```python
 507: shared = {"data": {}, "summary": {}, "config": {...}, ...}
 508: ```
 509: 
 510: It can also contain local file handlers, DB connections, or a combination for persistence. We recommend deciding the data structure or DB schema first based on your app requirements.
 511: 
 512: ### Example
 513: 
 514: ```python
 515: class LoadData(Node):
 516:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 517:         # We write data to shared store
 518:         shared["data"] = "Some text content"
 519:         return None
 520: 
 521: class Summarize(Node):
 522:     def prep(self, shared):
 523:         # We read data from shared store
 524:         return shared["data"]
 525: 
 526:     def exec(self, prep_res):
 527:         # Call LLM to summarize
 528:         prompt = f"Summarize: {prep_res}"
 529:         summary = call_llm(prompt)
 530:         return summary
 531: 
 532:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 533:         # We write summary to shared store
 534:         shared["summary"] = exec_res
 535:         return "default"
 536: 
 537: load_data = LoadData()
 538: summarize = Summarize()
 539: load_data >> summarize
 540: flow = Flow(start=load_data)
 541: 
 542: shared = {}
 543: flow.run(shared)
 544: ```
 545: 
 546: Here:
 547: - `LoadData` writes to `shared["data"]`.
 548: - `Summarize` reads from `shared["data"]`, summarizes, and writes to `shared["summary"]`.
 549: 
 550: ---
 551: 
 552: ## 2. Params
 553: 
 554: **Params** let you store *per-Node* or *per-Flow* config that doesn't need to live in the shared store. They are:
 555: - **Immutable** during a Node's run cycle (i.e., they don't change mid-`prep->exec->post`).
 556: - **Set** via `set_params()`.
 557: - **Cleared** and updated each time a parent Flow calls it.
 558: 
 559: > Only set the uppermost Flow params because others will be overwritten by the parent Flow. 
 560: > 
 561: > If you need to set child node params, see [Batch](./batch.md).
 562: {: .warning }
 563: 
 564: Typically, **Params** are identifiers (e.g., file name, page number). Use them to fetch the task you assigned or write to a specific part of the shared store.
 565: 
 566: ### Example
 567: 
 568: ```python
 569: # 1) Create a Node that uses params
 570: class SummarizeFile(Node):
 571:     def prep(self, shared):
 572:         # Access the node's param
 573:         filename = self.params["filename"]
 574:         return shared["data"].get(filename, "")
 575: 
 576:     def exec(self, prep_res):
 577:         prompt = f"Summarize: {prep_res}"
 578:         return call_llm(prompt)
 579: 
 580:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 581:         filename = self.params["filename"]
 582:         shared["summary"][filename] = exec_res
 583:         return "default"
 584: 
 585: # 2) Set params
 586: node = SummarizeFile()
 587: 
 588: # 3) Set Node params directly (for testing)
 589: node.set_params({"filename": "doc1.txt"})
 590: node.run(shared)
 591: 
 592: # 4) Create Flow
 593: flow = Flow(start=node)
 594: 
 595: # 5) Set Flow params (overwrites node params)
 596: flow.set_params({"filename": "doc2.txt"})
 597: flow.run(shared)  # The node summarizes doc2, not doc1
 598: ```

 609: 
 610: # Flow
 611: 
 612: A **Flow** orchestrates a graph of Nodes. You can chain Nodes in a sequence or create branching depending on the **Actions** returned from each Node's `post()`.
 613: 
 614: ## 1. Action-based Transitions
 615: 
 616: Each Node's `post()` returns an **Action** string. By default, if `post()` doesn't return anything, we treat that as `"default"`.
 617: 
 618: You define transitions with the syntax:
 619: 
 620: 1. **Basic default transition**: `node_a >> node_b`
 621:   This means if `node_a.post()` returns `"default"`, go to `node_b`. 
 622:   (Equivalent to `node_a - "default" >> node_b`)
 623: 
 624: 2. **Named action transition**: `node_a - "action_name" >> node_b`
 625:   This means if `node_a.post()` returns `"action_name"`, go to `node_b`.
 626: 
 627: It's possible to create loops, branching, or multi-step flows.
 628: 
 629: ## 2. Creating a Flow
 630: 
 631: A **Flow** begins with a **start** node. You call `Flow(start=some_node)` to specify the entry point. When you call `flow.run(shared)`, it executes the start node, looks at its returned Action from `post()`, follows the transition, and continues until there's no next node.
 632: 
 633: ### Example: Simple Sequence
 634: 
 635: Here's a minimal flow of two nodes in a chain:
 636: 
 637: ```python
 638: node_a >> node_b
 639: flow = Flow(start=node_a)
 640: flow.run(shared)
 641: ```
 642: 
 643: - When you run the flow, it executes `node_a`.  
 644: - Suppose `node_a.post()` returns `"default"`.  
 645: - The flow then sees `"default"` Action is linked to `node_b` and runs `node_b`.  
 646: - `node_b.post()` returns `"default"` but we didn't define `node_b >> something_else`. So the flow ends there.
 647: 
 648: ### Example: Branching & Looping
 649: 
 650: Here's a simple expense approval flow that demonstrates branching and looping. The `ReviewExpense` node can return three possible Actions:
 651: 
 652: - `"approved"`: expense is approved, move to payment processing
 653: - `"needs_revision"`: expense needs changes, send back for revision 
 654: - `"rejected"`: expense is denied, finish the process
 655: 
 656: We can wire them like this:
 657: 
 658: ```python
 659: # Define the flow connections
 660: review - "approved" >> payment        # If approved, process payment
 661: review - "needs_revision" >> revise   # If needs changes, go to revision
 662: review - "rejected" >> finish         # If rejected, finish the process
 663: 
 664: revise >> review   # After revision, go back for another review
 665: payment >> finish  # After payment, finish the process
 666: 
 667: flow = Flow(start=review)
 668: ```
 669: 
 670: Let's see how it flows:
 671: 
 672: 1. If `review.post()` returns `"approved"`, the expense moves to the `payment` node
 673: 2. If `review.post()` returns `"needs_revision"`, it goes to the `revise` node, which then loops back to `review`
 674: 3. If `review.post()` returns `"rejected"`, it moves to the `finish` node and stops
 675: 
 676: ```mermaid
 677: flowchart TD
 678:     review[Review Expense] -->|approved| payment[Process Payment]
 679:     review -->|needs_revision| revise[Revise Report]
 680:     review -->|rejected| finish[Finish Process]
 681: 
 682:     revise --> review
 683:     payment --> finish
 684: ```
 685: 
 686: ### Running Individual Nodes vs. Running a Flow
 687: 
 688: - `node.run(shared)`: Just runs that node alone (calls `prep->exec->post()`), returns an Action. 
 689: - `flow.run(shared)`: Executes from the start node, follows Actions to the next node, and so on until the flow can't continue.
 690: 
 691: > `node.run(shared)` **does not** proceed to the successor.
 692: > This is mainly for debugging or testing a single node.
 693: > 
 694: > Always use `flow.run(...)` in production to ensure the full pipeline runs correctly.
 695: {: .warning }
 696: 
 697: ## 3. Nested Flows
 698: 
 699: A **Flow** can act like a Node, which enables powerful composition patterns. This means you can:
 700: 
 701: 1. Use a Flow as a Node within another Flow's transitions.  
 702: 2. Combine multiple smaller Flows into a larger Flow for reuse.  
 703: 3. Node `params` will be a merging of **all** parents' `params`.
 704: 
 705: ### Flow's Node Methods
 706: 
 707: A **Flow** is also a **Node**, so it will run `prep()` and `post()`. However:
 708: 
 709: - It **won't** run `exec()`, as its main logic is to orchestrate its nodes.
 710: - `post()` always receives `None` for `exec_res` and should instead get the flow execution results from the shared store.
 711: 
 712: ### Basic Flow Nesting
 713: 
 714: Here's how to connect a flow to another node:
 715: 
 716: ```python
 717: # Create a sub-flow
 718: node_a >> node_b
 719: subflow = Flow(start=node_a)
 720: 
 721: # Connect it to another node
 722: subflow >> node_c
 723: 
 724: # Create the parent flow
 725: parent_flow = Flow(start=subflow)
 726: ```
 727: 
 728: When `parent_flow.run()` executes:
 729: 1. It starts `subflow`
 730: 2. `subflow` runs through its nodes (`node_a->node_b`)
 731: 3. After `subflow` completes, execution continues to `node_c`
 732: 
 733: ### Example: Order Processing Pipeline
 734: 
 735: Here's a practical example that breaks down order processing into nested flows:
 736: 
 737: ```python
 738: # Payment processing sub-flow
 739: validate_payment >> process_payment >> payment_confirmation
 740: payment_flow = Flow(start=validate_payment)
 741: 
 742: # Inventory sub-flow
 743: check_stock >> reserve_items >> update_inventory
 744: inventory_flow = Flow(start=check_stock)
 745: 
 746: # Shipping sub-flow
 747: create_label >> assign_carrier >> schedule_pickup
 748: shipping_flow = Flow(start=create_label)
 749: 
 750: # Connect the flows into a main order pipeline
 751: payment_flow >> inventory_flow >> shipping_flow
 752: 
 753: # Create the master flow
 754: order_pipeline = Flow(start=payment_flow)
 755: 
 756: # Run the entire pipeline
 757: order_pipeline.run(shared_data)
 758: ```
 759: 
 760: This creates a clean separation of concerns while maintaining a clear execution path:
 761: 
 762: ```mermaid
 763: flowchart LR
 764:     subgraph order_pipeline[Order Pipeline]
 765:         subgraph paymentFlow["Payment Flow"]
 766:             A[Validate Payment] --> B[Process Payment] --> C[Payment Confirmation]
 767:         end
 768: 
 769:         subgraph inventoryFlow["Inventory Flow"]
 770:             D[Check Stock] --> E[Reserve Items] --> F[Update Inventory]
 771:         end
 772: 
 773:         subgraph shippingFlow["Shipping Flow"]
 774:             G[Create Label] --> H[Assign Carrier] --> I[Schedule Pickup]
 775:         end
 776: 
 777:         paymentFlow --> inventoryFlow
 778:         inventoryFlow --> shippingFlow
 779:     end
 780: ```

 800: 1. `prep(shared)`
 801:    - **Read and preprocess data** from `shared` store. 
 802:    - Examples: *query DB, read files, or serialize data into a string*.
 803:    - Return `prep_res`, which is used by `exec()` and `post()`.
 804: 
 805: 2. `exec(prep_res)`
 806:    - **Execute compute logic**, with optional retries and error handling (below).
 807:    - Examples: *(mostly) LLM calls, remote APIs, tool use*.
 808:    - ⚠️ This shall be only for compute and **NOT** access `shared`.
 809:    - ⚠️ If retries enabled, ensure idempotent implementation.
 810:    - Return `exec_res`, which is passed to `post()`.
 811: 
 812: 3. `post(shared, prep_res, exec_res)`
 813:    - **Postprocess and write data** back to `shared`.
 814:    - Examples: *update DB, change states, log results*.
 815:    - **Decide the next action** by returning a *string* (`action = "default"` if *None*).
 816: 
 817: > **Why 3 steps?** To enforce the principle of *separation of concerns*. The data storage and data processing are operated separately.
 818: >
 819: > All steps are *optional*. E.g., you can only implement `prep` and `post` if you just need to process data.
 820: {: .note }
 821: 
 822: ### Fault Tolerance & Retries
 823: 
 824: You can **retry** `exec()` if it raises an exception via two parameters when define the Node:
 825: 
 826: - `max_retries` (int): Max times to run `exec()`. The default is `1` (**no** retry).
 827: - `wait` (int): The time to wait (in **seconds**) before next retry. By default, `wait=0` (no waiting). 
 828: `wait` is helpful when you encounter rate-limits or quota errors from your LLM provider and need to back off.
 829: 
 830: ```python 
 831: my_node = SummarizeFile(max_retries=3, wait=10)
 832: ```
 833: 
 834: When an exception occurs in `exec()`, the Node automatically retries until:
 835: 
 836: - It either succeeds, or
 837: - The Node has retried `max_retries - 1` times already and fails on the last attempt.
 838: 
 839: You can get the current retry times (0-based) from `self.cur_retry`.
 840: 
 841: ```python 
 842: class RetryNode(Node):
 843:     def exec(self, prep_res):
 844:         print(f"Retry {self.cur_retry} times")
 845:         raise Exception("Failed")
 846: ```
 847: 
 848: ### Graceful Fallback
 849: 
 850: To **gracefully handle** the exception (after all retries) rather than raising it, override:
 851: 
 852: ```python 
 853: def exec_fallback(self, prep_res, exc):
 854:     raise exc
 855: ```
 856: 
 857: By default, it just re-raises exception. But you can return a fallback result instead, which becomes the `exec_res` passed to `post()`.
 858: 
 859: ### Example: Summarize file
 860: 
 861: ```python 
 862: class SummarizeFile(Node):
 863:     def prep(self, shared):
 864:         return shared["data"]
 865: 
 866:     def exec(self, prep_res):
 867:         if not prep_res:
 868:             return "Empty file content"
 869:         prompt = f"Summarize this text in 10 words: {prep_res}"
 870:         summary = call_llm(prompt)  # might fail
 871:         return summary
 872: 
 873:     def exec_fallback(self, prep_res, exc):
 874:         # Provide a simple fallback instead of crashing
 875:         return "There was an error processing your request."
 876: 
 877:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 878:         shared["summary"] = exec_res
 879:         # Return "default" by not returning
 880: 
 881: summarize_node = SummarizeFile(max_retries=3)
 882: 
 883: # node.run() calls prep->exec->post
 884: # If exec() fails, it retries up to 3 times before calling exec_fallback()
 885: action_result = summarize_node.run(shared)
 886: 
 887: print("Action returned:", action_result)  # "default"
 888: print("Summary stored:", shared["summary"])
 889: ```

 903: 
 904: **Parallel** Nodes and Flows let you run multiple **Async** Nodes and Flows  **concurrently**—for example, summarizing multiple texts at once. This can improve performance by overlapping I/O and compute. 
 905: 
 906: > Because of Python’s GIL, parallel nodes and flows can’t truly parallelize CPU-bound tasks (e.g., heavy numerical computations). However, they excel at overlapping I/O-bound work—like LLM calls, database queries, API requests, or file I/O.
 907: {: .warning }
 908: 
 909: > - **Ensure Tasks Are Independent**: If each item depends on the output of a previous item, **do not** parallelize.
 910: > 
 911: > - **Beware of Rate Limits**: Parallel calls can **quickly** trigger rate limits on LLM services. You may need a **throttling** mechanism (e.g., semaphores or sleep intervals).
 912: > 
 913: > - **Consider Single-Node Batch APIs**: Some LLMs offer a **batch inference** API where you can send multiple prompts in a single call. This is more complex to implement but can be more efficient than launching many parallel requests and mitigates rate limits.

 916: ## AsyncParallelBatchNode
 917: 
 918: Like **AsyncBatchNode**, but run `exec_async()` in **parallel**:
 919: 
 920: ```python
 921: class ParallelSummaries(AsyncParallelBatchNode):
 922:     async def prep_async(self, shared):
 923:         # e.g., multiple texts
 924:         return shared["texts"]
 925: 
 926:     async def exec_async(self, text):
 927:         prompt = f"Summarize: {text}"
 928:         return await call_llm_async(prompt)
 929: 
 930:     async def post_async(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list):
 931:         shared["summary"] = "\n\n".join(exec_res_list)
 932:         return "default"
 933: 
 934: node = ParallelSummaries()
 935: flow = AsyncFlow(start=node)
 936: ```
 937: 
 938: ## AsyncParallelBatchFlow
 939: 
 940: Parallel version of **BatchFlow**. Each iteration of the sub-flow runs **concurrently** using different parameters:
 941: 
 942: ```python
 943: class SummarizeMultipleFiles(AsyncParallelBatchFlow):
 944:     async def prep_async(self, shared):
 945:         return [{"filename": f} for f in shared["files"]]

 962: # Agent
 963: 
 964: Agent is a powerful design pattern in which nodes can take dynamic actions based on the context.
 965: 
 966: <div align="center">
 967:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/agent.png?raw=true" width="350"/>
 968: </div>
 969: 
 970: ## Implement Agent with Graph
 971: 
 972: 1. **Context and Action:** Implement nodes that supply context and perform actions.  
 973: 2. **Branching:** Use branching to connect each action node to an agent node. Use action to allow the agent to direct the [flow](../core_abstraction/flow.md) between nodes—and potentially loop back for multi-step.
 974: 3. **Agent Node:** Provide a prompt to decide action—for example:
 975: 
 976: ```python
 977: f"""
 978: ### CONTEXT
 979: Task: {task_description}
 980: Previous Actions: {previous_actions}
 981: Current State: {current_state}
 982: 
 983: ### ACTION SPACE
 984: [1] search
 985:   Description: Use web search to get results
 986:   Parameters:
 987:     - query (str): What to search for
 988: 
 989: [2] answer
 990:   Description: Conclude based on the results
 991:   Parameters:
 992:     - result (str): Final answer to provide
 993: 
 994: ### NEXT ACTION
 995: Decide the next action based on the current context and available action space.
 996: Return your response in the following format:
 997: 
 998: ```yaml
 999: thinking: |
1000:     <your step-by-step reasoning process>
1001: action: <action_name>
1002: parameters:
1003:     <parameter_name>: <parameter_value>
1004: ```"""
1005: ```
1006: 
1007: The core of building **high-performance** and **reliable** agents boils down to:
1008: 
1009: 1. **Context Management:** Provide *relevant, minimal context.* For example, rather than including an entire chat history, retrieve the most relevant via [RAG](./rag.md). Even with larger context windows, LLMs still fall victim to ["lost in the middle"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172), overlooking mid-prompt content.
1010: 
1011: 2. **Action Space:** Provide *a well-structured and unambiguous* set of actions—avoiding overlap like separate `read_databases` or  `read_csvs`. Instead, import CSVs into the database.
1012: 
1013: ## Example Good Action Design
1014: 
1015: - **Incremental:** Feed content in manageable chunks (500 lines or 1 page) instead of all at once.
1016: 
1017: - **Overview-zoom-in:** First provide high-level structure (table of contents, summary), then allow drilling into details (raw texts).
1018: 
1019: - **Parameterized/Programmable:** Instead of fixed actions, enable parameterized (columns to select) or programmable (SQL queries) actions, for example, to read CSV files.
1020: 
1021: - **Backtracking:** Let the agent undo the last step instead of restarting entirely, preserving progress when encountering errors or dead ends.
1022: 
1023: ## Example: Search Agent
1024: 
1025: This agent:
1026: 1. Decides whether to search or answer
1027: 2. If searches, loops back to decide if more search needed
1028: 3. Answers when enough context gathered
1029: 
1030: ```python
1031: class DecideAction(Node):
1032:     def prep(self, shared):
1033:         context = shared.get("context", "No previous search")
1034:         query = shared["query"]
1035:         return query, context
1036:         
1037:     def exec(self, inputs):
1038:         query, context = inputs
1039:         prompt = f"""
1040: Given input: {query}
1041: Previous search results: {context}
1042: Should I: 1) Search web for more info 2) Answer with current knowledge
1043: Output in yaml:
1044: ```yaml
1045: action: search/answer
1046: reason: why this action
1047: search_term: search phrase if action is search
1048: ```"""
1049:         resp = call_llm(prompt)
1050:         yaml_str = resp.split("```yaml")[1].split("```")[0].strip()
1051:         result = yaml.safe_load(yaml_str)
1052:

1055:         assert "reason" in result
1056:         assert result["action"] in ["search", "answer"]

1116: # Map Reduce

1118: MapReduce is a design pattern suitable when you have either:
1119: - Large input data (e.g., multiple files to process), or
1120: - Large output data (e.g., multiple forms to fill)
1121:

1199: 2. **Online stage**: Given a question, generate answers by retrieving the most relevant context.
1200: 
1201: ---
1202: ## Stage 1: Offline Indexing
1203: 
1204: We create three Nodes:
1205: 1. `ChunkDocs` – [chunks](../utility_function/chunking.md) raw text.
1206: 2. `EmbedDocs` – [embeds](../utility_function/embedding.md) each chunk.
1207: 3. `StoreIndex` – stores embeddings into a [vector database](../utility_function/vector.md).
1208: 
1209: ```python

1245: 
1246: class StoreIndex(Node):
1247:     def prep(self, shared):
1248:         # We'll read all embeds from shared.

1270: 
1271: ```python
1272: shared = {
1273:     "files": ["doc1.txt", "doc2.txt"],  # any text files
1274: }
1275: OfflineFlow.run(shared)
1276: ```
1277: 
1278: ---
1279: ## Stage 2: Online Query & Answer
1280: 
1281: We have 3 nodes:
1282: 1. `EmbedQuery` – embeds the user’s question.
1283: 2. `RetrieveDocs` – retrieves top chunk from the index.
1284: 3. `GenerateAnswer` – calls the LLM with the question + chunk to produce the final answer.
1285: 
1286: ```python
1287: class EmbedQuery(Node):
1288:     def prep(self, shared):
1289:         return shared["question"]
1290: 
1291:     def exec(self, question):

1297: class RetrieveDocs(Node):
1298:     def prep(self, shared):
1299:         # We'll need the query embedding, plus the offline index/chunks
1300:         return shared["q_emb"], shared["index"], shared["all_chunks"]
1301: 
1302:     def exec(self, inputs):
1303:         q_emb, index, chunks = inputs
1304:         I, D = search_index(index, q_emb, top_k=1)
1305:         best_id = I[0][0]
1306:         relevant_chunk = chunks[best_id]
1307:         return relevant_chunk
1308: 
1309:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, relevant_chunk):
1310:         shared["retrieved_chunk"] = relevant_chunk
1311:         print("Retrieved chunk:", relevant_chunk[:60], "...")
1312: 
1313: class GenerateAnswer(Node):
1314:     def prep(self, shared):

1325: 
1326: embed_qnode = EmbedQuery()
1327: retrieve_node = RetrieveDocs()
1328: generate_node = GenerateAnswer()
1329: 
1330: embed_qnode >> retrieve_node >> generate_node
1331: OnlineFlow = Flow(start=embed_qnode)
1332: ```
1333: 
1334: Usage example:
1335: 
1336: ```python
1337: # Suppose we already ran OfflineFlow and have:
1338: # shared["all_chunks"], shared["index"], etc.
1339: shared["question"] = "Why do people like cats?"
1340: 
1341: OnlineFlow.run(shared)
1342: # final answer in shared["answer"]

1354: 
1355: # Structured Output
1356: 
1357: In many use cases, you may want the LLM to output a specific structure, such as a list or a dictionary with predefined keys.
1358: 
1359: There are several approaches to achieve a structured output:
1360: - **Prompting** the LLM to strictly return a defined structure.
1361: - Using LLMs that natively support **schema enforcement**.
1362: - **Post-processing** the LLM's response to extract structured content.
1363: 
1364: In practice, **Prompting** is simple and reliable for modern LLMs.
1365: 
1366: ### Example Use Cases
1367: 
1368: - Extracting Key Information 
1369: 
1370: ```yaml
1371: product:
1372:   name: Widget Pro
1373:   price: 199.99
1374:   description: |
1375:     A high-quality widget designed for professionals.
1376:     Recommended for advanced users.
1377: ```
1378: 
1379: - Summarizing Documents into Bullet Points
1380: 
1381: ```yaml
1382: summary:
1383:   - This product is easy to use.
1384:   - It is cost-effective.
1385:   - Suitable for all skill levels.
1386: ```
1387: 
1388: - Generating Configuration Files
1389: 
1390: ```yaml
1391: server:
1392:   host: 127.0.0.1
1393:   port: 8080
1394:   ssl: true
1395: ```
1396: 
1397: ## Prompt Engineering
1398: 
1399: When prompting the LLM to produce **structured** output:
1400: 1. **Wrap** the structure in code fences (e.g., `yaml`).
1401: 2. **Validate** that all required fields exist (and let `Node` handles retry).
1402: 
1403: ### Example Text Summarization
1404: 
1405: ```python
1406: class SummarizeNode(Node):
1407:     def exec(self, prep_res):
1408:         # Suppose `prep_res` is the text to summarize.
1409:         prompt = f"""
1410: Please summarize the following text as YAML, with exactly 3 bullet points
1411: 
1412: {prep_res}
1413: 
1414: Now, output:
1415: ```yaml
1416: summary:
1417:   - bullet 1
1418:   - bullet 2
1419:   - bullet 3
1420: ```"""
1421:         response = call_llm(prompt)
1422:         yaml_str = response.split("```yaml")[1].split("```")[0].strip()
1423: 
1424:         import yaml
1425:         structured_result = yaml.safe_load(yaml_str)
1426: 
1427:         assert "summary" in structured_result
1428:         assert isinstance(structured_result["summary"], list)
1429: 
1430:         return structured_result
1431: ```
1432: 
1433: > Besides using `assert` statements, another popular way to validate schemas is [Pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic)
1434: {: .note }
1435: 
1436: ### Why YAML instead of JSON?
1437: 
1438: Current LLMs struggle with escaping. YAML is easier with strings since they don't always need quotes.
1439: 
1440: **In JSON**  
1441: 
1442: ```json
1443: {
1444:   "dialogue": "Alice said: \"Hello Bob.\\nHow are you?\\nI am good.\""
1445: }
1446: ```
1447: 
1448: - Every double quote inside the string must be escaped with `\"`.
1449: - Each newline in the dialogue must be represented as `\n`.
1450: 
1451: **In YAML**  
1452: 
1453: ```yaml
1454: dialogue: |
1455:   Alice said: "Hello Bob.
1456:   How are you?
1457:   I am good."
1458: ```
1459: 
1460: - No need to escape interior quotes—just place the entire text under a block literal (`|`).
1461: - Newlines are naturally preserved without needing `\n`.

1473: # Workflow
1474: 
1475: Many real-world tasks are too complex for one LLM call. The solution is to **Task Decomposition**: decompose them into a [chain](../core_abstraction/flow.md) of multiple Nodes.

1481: > - You don't want to make each task **too coarse**, because it may be *too complex for one LLM call*.
1482: > - You don't want to make each task **too granular**, because then *the LLM call doesn't have enough context* and results are *not consistent across nodes*.
1483: > 
1484: > You usually need multiple *iterations* to find the *sweet spot*. If the task has too many *edge cases*, consider using [Agents](./agent.md).

1604: ## Improvements
1605: Feel free to enhance your `call_llm` function as needed. Here are examples:
1606: 
1607: - Handle chat history:

1615:         messages=messages
1616:     )
1617:     return r.choices[0].message.content
1618: ```
1619: 
1620: - Add in-memory caching 
1621: 
1622: ```python
1623: from functools import lru_cache
1624: 
1625: @lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
1626: def call_llm(prompt):
1627:     # Your implementation here
1628:     pass
1629: ```
1630: 
1631: > ⚠️ Caching conflicts with Node retries, as retries yield the same result.
1632: >
1633: > To address this, you could use cached results only if not retried.

1643: 
1644: def call_llm(prompt, use_cache):
1645:     if use_cache:
1646:         return cached_call(prompt)
1647:     # Call the underlying function directly
1648:     return cached_call.__wrapped__(prompt)

   8: > If you are an AI agents involved in building LLM Systems, read this guide **VERY, VERY** carefully! This is the most important chapter in the entire document. Throughout development, you should always (1) start with a small and simple solution, (2) design at a high level (`docs/design.md`) before implementation, and (3) frequently ask humans for feedback and clarification.

  11: ## Agentic Coding Steps
  12: 
  13: Agentic Coding should be a collaboration between Human System Design and Agent Implementation:
  14: 
  15: | Steps                  | Human      | AI        | Comment                                                                 |
  16: |:-----------------------|:----------:|:---------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  17: | 1. Requirements | ★★★ High  | ★☆☆ Low   | Humans understand the requirements and context.                    |
  18: | 2. Flow          | ★★☆ Medium | ★★☆ Medium |  Humans specify the high-level design, and the AI fills in the details. |
  19: | 3. Utilities   | ★★☆ Medium | ★★☆ Medium | Humans provide available external APIs and integrations, and the AI helps with implementation. |
  20: | 4. Node          | ★☆☆ Low   | ★★★ High  | The AI helps design the node types and data handling based on the flow.          |
  21: | 5. Implementation      | ★☆☆ Low   | ★★★ High  |  The AI implements the flow based on the design. |
  22: | 6. Optimization        | ★★☆ Medium | ★★☆ Medium | Humans evaluate the results, and the AI helps optimize. |
  23: | 7. Reliability         | ★☆☆ Low   | ★★★ High  |  The AI writes test cases and addresses corner cases.     |
  24: 
  25: 1. **Requirements**: Clarify the requirements for your project, and evaluate whether an AI system is a good fit. 
  26:     - Understand AI systems' strengths and limitations:
  27:       - **Good for**: Routine tasks requiring common sense (filling forms, replying to emails)
  28:       - **Good for**: Creative tasks with well-defined inputs (building slides, writing SQL)
  29:       - **Not good for**: Ambiguous problems requiring complex decision-making (business strategy, startup planning)
  30:     - **Keep It User-Centric:** Explain the "problem" from the user's perspective rather than just listing features.
  31:     - **Balance complexity vs. impact**: Aim to deliver the highest value features with minimal complexity early.
  32: 
  33: 2. **Flow Design**: Outline at a high level, describe how your AI system orchestrates nodes.
  34:     - Identify applicable design patterns (e.g., [Map Reduce](./design_pattern/mapreduce.md), [Agent](./design_pattern/agent.md), [RAG](./design_pattern/rag.md)).
  35:       - For each node in the flow, start with a high-level one-line description of what it does.
  36:       - If using **Map Reduce**, specify how to map (what to split) and how to reduce (how to combine).
  37:       - If using **Agent**, specify what are the inputs (context) and what are the possible actions.
  38:       - If using **RAG**, specify what to embed, noting that there's usually both offline (indexing) and online (retrieval) workflows.
  39:     - Outline the flow and draw it in a mermaid diagram. For example:
  40:       ```mermaid
  41:       flowchart LR
  42:           start[Start] --> batch[Batch]
  43:           batch --> check[Check]
  44:           check -->|OK| process
  45:           check -->|Error| fix[Fix]
  46:           fix --> check
  47:           
  48:           subgraph process[Process]
  49:             step1[Step 1] --> step2[Step 2]
  50:           end
  51:           
  52:           process --> endNode[End]
  53:       ```
  54:     - > **If Humans can't specify the flow, AI Agents can't automate it!** Before building an LLM system, thoroughly understand the problem and potential solution by manually solving example inputs to develop intuition.  
  55:       {: .best-practice }
  56: 
  57: 3. **Utilities**: Based on the Flow Design, identify and implement necessary utility functions.
  58:     - Think of your AI system as the brain. It needs a body—these *external utility functions*—to interact with the real world:
  59:         <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/utility.png?raw=true" width="400"/></div>
  60: 
  61:         - Reading inputs (e.g., retrieving Slack messages, reading emails)
  62:         - Writing outputs (e.g., generating reports, sending emails)
  63:         - Using external tools (e.g., calling LLMs, searching the web)
  64:         - **NOTE**: *LLM-based tasks* (e.g., summarizing text, analyzing sentiment) are **NOT** utility functions; rather, they are *core functions* internal in the AI system.
  65:     - For each utility function, implement it and write a simple test.
  66:     - Document their input/output, as well as why they are necessary. For example:
  67:       - `name`: `get_embedding` (`utils/get_embedding.py`)
  68:       - `input`: `str`
  69:       - `output`: a vector of 3072 floats
  70:       - `necessity`: Used by the second node to embed text
  71:     - Example utility implementation:
  72:       ```python
  73:       # utils/call_llm.py
  74:       from openai import OpenAI
  75: 
  76:       def call_llm(prompt):    
  77:           client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
  78:           r = client.chat.completions.create(
  79:               model="gpt-4o",
  80:               messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
  81:           )
  82:           return r.choices[0].message.content
  83:           
  84:       if __name__ == "__main__":
  85:           prompt = "What is the meaning of life?"
  86:           print(call_llm(prompt))
  87:       ```
  88:     - > **Sometimes, design Utilies before Flow:**  For example, for an LLM project to automate a legacy system, the bottleneck will likely be the available interface to that system. Start by designing the hardest utilities for interfacing, and then build the flow around them.
  89:       {: .best-practice }
  90: 
  91: 4. **Node Design**: Plan how each node will read and write data, and use utility functions.
  92:    - One core design principle for PocketFlow is to use a [shared store](./core_abstraction/communication.md), so start with a shared store design:
  93:       - For simple systems, use an in-memory dictionary.
  94:       - For more complex systems or when persistence is required, use a database.
  95:       - **Don't Repeat Yourself**: Use in-memory references or foreign keys.
  96:       - Example shared store design:
  97:         ```python
  98:         shared = {
  99:             "user": {
 100:                 "id": "user123",
 101:                 "context": {                # Another nested dict
 102:                     "weather": {"temp": 72, "condition": "sunny"},
 103:                     "location": "San Francisco"
 104:                 }
 105:             },
 106:             "results": {}                   # Empty dict to store outputs
 107:         }
 108:         ```
 109:    - For each [Node](./core_abstraction/node.md), describe its type, how it reads and writes data, and which utility function it uses. Keep it specific but high-level without codes. For example:
 110:      - `type`: Regular (or Batch, or Async)
 111:      - `prep`: Read "text" from the shared store
 112:      - `exec`: Call the embedding utility function
 113:      - `post`: Write "embedding" to the shared store
 114: 
 115: 5. **Implementation**: Implement the initial nodes and flows based on the design.
 116:    - 🎉 If you've reached this step, humans have finished the design. Now *Agentic Coding* begins!
 117:    - **"Keep it simple, stupid!"** Avoid complex features and full-scale type checking.
 118:    - **FAIL FAST**! Avoid `try` logic so you can quickly identify any weak points in the system.
 119:    - Add logging throughout the code to facilitate debugging.
 120: 
 121: 7. **Optimization**:
 122:    - **Use Intuition**: For a quick initial evaluation, human intuition is often a good start.
 123:    - **Redesign Flow (Back to Step 3)**: Consider breaking down tasks further, introducing agentic decisions, or better managing input contexts.
 124:    - If your flow design is already solid, move on to micro-optimizations:
 125:      - **Prompt Engineering**: Use clear, specific instructions with examples to reduce ambiguity.
 126:      - **In-Context Learning**: Provide robust examples for tasks that are difficult to specify with instructions alone.
 127: 
 128:    - > **You'll likely iterate a lot!** Expect to repeat Steps 3–6 hundreds of times.
 129:      >
 130:      > <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/success.png?raw=true" width="400"/></div>
 131:      {: .best-practice }
 132: 
 133: 8. **Reliability**  
 134:    - **Node Retries**: Add checks in the node `exec` to ensure outputs meet requirements, and consider increasing `max_retries` and `wait` times.
 135:    - **Logging and Visualization**: Maintain logs of all attempts and visualize node results for easier debugging.
 136:    - **Self-Evaluation**: Add a separate node (powered by an LLM) to review outputs when results are uncertain.

 155: - **`utils/`**: Contains all utility functions.
 156:   - It's recommended to dedicate one Python file to each API call, for example `call_llm.py` or `search_web.py`.
 157:   - Each file should also include a `main()` function to try that API call
 158: - **`nodes.py`**: Contains all the node definitions.
 159:   ```python
 160:   # nodes.py
 161:   from pocketflow import Node

 186:           shared["answer"] = exec_res
 187:   ```
 188: - **`flow.py`**: Implements functions that create flows by importing node definitions and connecting them.

 238: # Pocket Flow
 239: 
 240: A [100-line](https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/blob/main/pocketflow/__init__.py) minimalist LLM framework for *Agents, Task Decomposition, RAG, etc*.
 241: 
 242: - **Lightweight**: Just the core graph abstraction in 100 lines. ZERO dependencies, and vendor lock-in.
 243: - **Expressive**: Everything you love from larger frameworks—([Multi-](./design_pattern/multi_agent.html))[Agents](./design_pattern/agent.html), [Workflow](./design_pattern/workflow.html), [RAG](./design_pattern/rag.html), and more.  
 244: - **Agentic-Coding**: Intuitive enough for AI agents to help humans build complex LLM applications.
 245: 
 246: <div align="center">
 247:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/meme.jpg?raw=true" width="400"/>
 248: </div>
 249: 
 250: ## Core Abstraction
 251: 
 252: We model the LLM workflow as a **Graph + Shared Store**:
 253: 
 254: - [Node](./core_abstraction/node.md) handles simple (LLM) tasks.
 255: - [Flow](./core_abstraction/flow.md) connects nodes through **Actions** (labeled edges).
 256: - [Shared Store](./core_abstraction/communication.md) enables communication between nodes within flows.
 257: - [Batch](./core_abstraction/batch.md) nodes/flows allow for data-intensive tasks.
 258: - [Async](./core_abstraction/async.md) nodes/flows allow waiting for asynchronous tasks.
 259: - [(Advanced) Parallel](./core_abstraction/parallel.md) nodes/flows handle I/O-bound tasks.
 260: 
 261: <div align="center">
 262:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/abstraction.png" width="500"/>
 263: </div>
 264: 
 265: ## Design Pattern
 266: 
 267: From there, it’s easy to implement popular design patterns:
 268: 
 269: - [Agent](./design_pattern/agent.md) autonomously makes decisions.
 270: - [Workflow](./design_pattern/workflow.md) chains multiple tasks into pipelines.
 271: - [RAG](./design_pattern/rag.md) integrates data retrieval with generation.
 272: - [Map Reduce](./design_pattern/mapreduce.md) splits data tasks into Map and Reduce steps.
 273: - [Structured Output](./design_pattern/structure.md) formats outputs consistently.
 274: - [(Advanced) Multi-Agents](./design_pattern/multi_agent.md) coordinate multiple agents.
 275: 
 276: <div align="center">
 277:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/design.png" width="500"/>
 278: </div>
 279: 
 280: ## Utility Function
 281: 
 282: We **do not** provide built-in utilities. Instead, we offer *examples*—please *implement your own*:
 283: 
 284: - [LLM Wrapper](./utility_function/llm.md)
 285: - [Viz and Debug](./utility_function/viz.md)
 286: - [Web Search](./utility_function/websearch.md)
 287: - [Chunking](./utility_function/chunking.md)
 288: - [Embedding](./utility_function/embedding.md)
 289: - [Vector Databases](./utility_function/vector.md)
 290: - [Text-to-Speech](./utility_function/text_to_speech.md)
 291: 
 292: **Why not built-in?**: I believe it's a *bad practice* for vendor-specific APIs in a general framework:
 293: - *API Volatility*: Frequent changes lead to heavy maintenance for hardcoded APIs.
 294: - *Flexibility*: You may want to switch vendors, use fine-tuned models, or run them locally.
 295: - *Optimizations*: Prompt caching, batching, and streaming are easier without vendor lock-in.

 311: # (Advanced) Async
 312: 
 313: **Async** Nodes implement `prep_async()`, `exec_async()`, `exec_fallback_async()`, and/or `post_async()`. This is useful for:
 314: 
 315: 1. **prep_async()**: For *fetching/reading data (files, APIs, DB)* in an I/O-friendly way.
 316: 2. **exec_async()**: Typically used for async LLM calls.
 317: 3. **post_async()**: For *awaiting user feedback*, *coordinating across multi-agents* or any additional async steps after `exec_async()`.
 318: 
 319: **Note**: `AsyncNode` must be wrapped in `AsyncFlow`. `AsyncFlow` can also include regular (sync) nodes.
 320: 
 321: ### Example
 322: 
 323: ```python
 324: class SummarizeThenVerify(AsyncNode):
 325:     async def prep_async(self, shared):
 326:         # Example: read a file asynchronously
 327:         doc_text = await read_file_async(shared["doc_path"])
 328:         return doc_text
 329: 
 330:     async def exec_async(self, prep_res):
 331:         # Example: async LLM call
 332:         summary = await call_llm_async(f"Summarize: {prep_res}")
 333:         return summary
 334: 
 335:     async def post_async(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 336:         # Example: wait for user feedback
 337:         decision = await gather_user_feedback(exec_res)
 338:         if decision == "approve":
 339:             shared["summary"] = exec_res
 340:             return "approve"
 341:         return "deny"
 342: 
 343: summarize_node = SummarizeThenVerify()
 344: final_node = Finalize()
 345: 
 346: # Define transitions
 347: summarize_node - "approve" >> final_node
 348: summarize_node - "deny"    >> summarize_node  # retry
 349: 
 350: flow = AsyncFlow(start=summarize_node)
 351: 
 352: async def main():
 353:     shared = {"doc_path": "document.txt"}
 354:     await flow.run_async(shared)
 355:     print("Final Summary:", shared.get("summary"))
 356: 
 357: asyncio.run(main())

 369: 
 370: # Batch
 371: 
 372: **Batch** makes it easier to handle large inputs in one Node or **rerun** a Flow multiple times. Example use cases:
 373: - **Chunk-based** processing (e.g., splitting large texts).
 374: - **Iterative** processing over lists of input items (e.g., user queries, files, URLs).
 375: 
 376: ## 1. BatchNode
 377: 
 378: A **BatchNode** extends `Node` but changes `prep()` and `exec()`:
 379: 
 380: - **`prep(shared)`**: returns an **iterable** (e.g., list, generator).
 381: - **`exec(item)`**: called **once** per item in that iterable.
 382: - **`post(shared, prep_res, exec_res_list)`**: after all items are processed, receives a **list** of results (`exec_res_list`) and returns an **Action**.
 383: 
 384: 
 385: ### Example: Summarize a Large File
 386: 
 387: ```python
 388: class MapSummaries(BatchNode):
 389:     def prep(self, shared):
 390:         # Suppose we have a big file; chunk it
 391:         content = shared["data"]
 392:         chunk_size = 10000
 393:         chunks = [content[i:i+chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(content), chunk_size)]
 394:         return chunks
 395: 
 396:     def exec(self, chunk):
 397:         prompt = f"Summarize this chunk in 10 words: {chunk}"
 398:         summary = call_llm(prompt)
 399:         return summary
 400: 
 401:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list):
 402:         combined = "\n".join(exec_res_list)
 403:         shared["summary"] = combined
 404:         return "default"
 405: 
 406: map_summaries = MapSummaries()
 407: flow = Flow(start=map_summaries)
 408: flow.run(shared)
 409: ```
 410: 
 411: ---
 412: 
 413: ## 2. BatchFlow
 414: 
 415: A **BatchFlow** runs a **Flow** multiple times, each time with different `params`. Think of it as a loop that replays the Flow for each parameter set.
 416: 
 417: ### Example: Summarize Many Files
 418: 
 419: ```python
 420: class SummarizeAllFiles(BatchFlow):
 421:     def prep(self, shared):
 422:         # Return a list of param dicts (one per file)
 423:         filenames = list(shared["data"].keys())  # e.g., ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", ...]
 424:         return [{"filename": fn} for fn in filenames]
 425: 
 426: # Suppose we have a per-file Flow (e.g., load_file >> summarize >> reduce):
 427: summarize_file = SummarizeFile(start=load_file)
 428: 
 429: # Wrap that flow into a BatchFlow:
 430: summarize_all_files = SummarizeAllFiles(start=summarize_file)
 431: summarize_all_files.run(shared)
 432: ```
 433: 
 434: ### Under the Hood
 435: 1. `prep(shared)` returns a list of param dicts—e.g., `[{filename: "file1.txt"}, {filename: "file2.txt"}, ...]`.
 436: 2. The **BatchFlow** loops through each dict. For each one:
 437:    - It merges the dict with the BatchFlow’s own `params`.
 438:    - It calls `flow.run(shared)` using the merged result.
 439: 3. This means the sub-Flow is run **repeatedly**, once for every param dict.
 440: 
 441: ---
 442: 
 443: ## 3. Nested or Multi-Level Batches
 444: 
 445: You can nest a **BatchFlow** in another **BatchFlow**. For instance:
 446: - **Outer** batch: returns a list of diretory param dicts (e.g., `{"directory": "/pathA"}`, `{"directory": "/pathB"}`, ...).
 447: - **Inner** batch: returning a list of per-file param dicts.
 448: 
 449: At each level, **BatchFlow** merges its own param dict with the parent’s. By the time you reach the **innermost** node, the final `params` is the merged result of **all** parents in the chain. This way, a nested structure can keep track of the entire context (e.g., directory + file name) at once.
 450: 
 451: ```python
 452: 
 453: class FileBatchFlow(BatchFlow):
 454:     def prep(self, shared):
 455:         directory = self.params["directory"]
 456:         # e.g., files = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", ...]
 457:         files = [f for f in os.listdir(directory) if f.endswith(".txt")]
 458:         return [{"filename": f} for f in files]
 459: 
 460: class DirectoryBatchFlow(BatchFlow):
 461:     def prep(self, shared):
 462:         directories = [ "/path/to/dirA", "/path/to/dirB"]
 463:         return [{"directory": d} for d in directories]
 464: 
 465: # MapSummaries have params like {"directory": "/path/to/dirA", "filename": "file1.txt"}
 466: inner_flow = FileBatchFlow(start=MapSummaries())
 467: outer_flow = DirectoryBatchFlow(start=inner_flow)
 468: ```

 480: # Communication
 481: 
 482: Nodes and Flows **communicate** in 2 ways:
 483: 
 484: 1. **Shared Store (for almost all the cases)** 
 485: 
 486:    - A global data structure (often an in-mem dict) that all nodes can read ( `prep()`) and write (`post()`).  
 487:    - Great for data results, large content, or anything multiple nodes need.
 488:    - You shall design the data structure and populate it ahead.
 489:      
 490:    - > **Separation of Concerns:** Use `Shared Store` for almost all cases to separate *Data Schema* from *Compute Logic*!  This approach is both flexible and easy to manage, resulting in more maintainable code. `Params` is more a syntax sugar for [Batch](./batch.md).
 491:      {: .best-practice }
 492: 
 493: 2. **Params (only for [Batch](./batch.md))** 
 494:    - Each node has a local, ephemeral `params` dict passed in by the **parent Flow**, used as an identifier for tasks. Parameter keys and values shall be **immutable**.
 495:    - Good for identifiers like filenames or numeric IDs, in Batch mode.
 496: 
 497: If you know memory management, think of the **Shared Store** like a **heap** (shared by all function calls), and **Params** like a **stack** (assigned by the caller).
 498: 
 499: ---
 500: 
 501: ## 1. Shared Store
 502: 
 503: ### Overview
 504: 
 505: A shared store is typically an in-mem dictionary, like:
 506: ```python
 507: shared = {"data": {}, "summary": {}, "config": {...}, ...}
 508: ```
 509: 
 510: It can also contain local file handlers, DB connections, or a combination for persistence. We recommend deciding the data structure or DB schema first based on your app requirements.
 511: 
 512: ### Example
 513: 
 514: ```python
 515: class LoadData(Node):
 516:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 517:         # We write data to shared store
 518:         shared["data"] = "Some text content"
 519:         return None
 520: 
 521: class Summarize(Node):
 522:     def prep(self, shared):
 523:         # We read data from shared store
 524:         return shared["data"]
 525: 
 526:     def exec(self, prep_res):
 527:         # Call LLM to summarize
 528:         prompt = f"Summarize: {prep_res}"
 529:         summary = call_llm(prompt)
 530:         return summary
 531: 
 532:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 533:         # We write summary to shared store
 534:         shared["summary"] = exec_res
 535:         return "default"
 536: 
 537: load_data = LoadData()
 538: summarize = Summarize()
 539: load_data >> summarize
 540: flow = Flow(start=load_data)
 541: 
 542: shared = {}
 543: flow.run(shared)
 544: ```
 545: 
 546: Here:
 547: - `LoadData` writes to `shared["data"]`.
 548: - `Summarize` reads from `shared["data"]`, summarizes, and writes to `shared["summary"]`.
 549: 
 550: ---
 551: 
 552: ## 2. Params
 553: 
 554: **Params** let you store *per-Node* or *per-Flow* config that doesn't need to live in the shared store. They are:
 555: - **Immutable** during a Node's run cycle (i.e., they don't change mid-`prep->exec->post`).
 556: - **Set** via `set_params()`.
 557: - **Cleared** and updated each time a parent Flow calls it.
 558: 
 559: > Only set the uppermost Flow params because others will be overwritten by the parent Flow. 
 560: > 
 561: > If you need to set child node params, see [Batch](./batch.md).
 562: {: .warning }
 563: 
 564: Typically, **Params** are identifiers (e.g., file name, page number). Use them to fetch the task you assigned or write to a specific part of the shared store.
 565: 
 566: ### Example
 567: 
 568: ```python
 569: # 1) Create a Node that uses params
 570: class SummarizeFile(Node):
 571:     def prep(self, shared):
 572:         # Access the node's param
 573:         filename = self.params["filename"]
 574:         return shared["data"].get(filename, "")
 575: 
 576:     def exec(self, prep_res):
 577:         prompt = f"Summarize: {prep_res}"
 578:         return call_llm(prompt)
 579: 
 580:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 581:         filename = self.params["filename"]
 582:         shared["summary"][filename] = exec_res
 583:         return "default"
 584: 
 585: # 2) Set params
 586: node = SummarizeFile()
 587: 
 588: # 3) Set Node params directly (for testing)
 589: node.set_params({"filename": "doc1.txt"})
 590: node.run(shared)
 591: 
 592: # 4) Create Flow
 593: flow = Flow(start=node)
 594: 
 595: # 5) Set Flow params (overwrites node params)
 596: flow.set_params({"filename": "doc2.txt"})
 597: flow.run(shared)  # The node summarizes doc2, not doc1
 598: ```

 609: 
 610: # Flow
 611: 
 612: A **Flow** orchestrates a graph of Nodes. You can chain Nodes in a sequence or create branching depending on the **Actions** returned from each Node's `post()`.
 613: 
 614: ## 1. Action-based Transitions
 615: 
 616: Each Node's `post()` returns an **Action** string. By default, if `post()` doesn't return anything, we treat that as `"default"`.
 617: 
 618: You define transitions with the syntax:
 619: 
 620: 1. **Basic default transition**: `node_a >> node_b`
 621:   This means if `node_a.post()` returns `"default"`, go to `node_b`. 
 622:   (Equivalent to `node_a - "default" >> node_b`)
 623: 
 624: 2. **Named action transition**: `node_a - "action_name" >> node_b`
 625:   This means if `node_a.post()` returns `"action_name"`, go to `node_b`.
 626: 
 627: It's possible to create loops, branching, or multi-step flows.
 628: 
 629: ## 2. Creating a Flow
 630: 
 631: A **Flow** begins with a **start** node. You call `Flow(start=some_node)` to specify the entry point. When you call `flow.run(shared)`, it executes the start node, looks at its returned Action from `post()`, follows the transition, and continues until there's no next node.
 632: 
 633: ### Example: Simple Sequence
 634: 
 635: Here's a minimal flow of two nodes in a chain:
 636: 
 637: ```python
 638: node_a >> node_b
 639: flow = Flow(start=node_a)
 640: flow.run(shared)
 641: ```
 642: 
 643: - When you run the flow, it executes `node_a`.  
 644: - Suppose `node_a.post()` returns `"default"`.  
 645: - The flow then sees `"default"` Action is linked to `node_b` and runs `node_b`.  
 646: - `node_b.post()` returns `"default"` but we didn't define `node_b >> something_else`. So the flow ends there.
 647: 
 648: ### Example: Branching & Looping
 649: 
 650: Here's a simple expense approval flow that demonstrates branching and looping. The `ReviewExpense` node can return three possible Actions:
 651: 
 652: - `"approved"`: expense is approved, move to payment processing
 653: - `"needs_revision"`: expense needs changes, send back for revision 
 654: - `"rejected"`: expense is denied, finish the process
 655: 
 656: We can wire them like this:
 657: 
 658: ```python
 659: # Define the flow connections
 660: review - "approved" >> payment        # If approved, process payment
 661: review - "needs_revision" >> revise   # If needs changes, go to revision
 662: review - "rejected" >> finish         # If rejected, finish the process
 663: 
 664: revise >> review   # After revision, go back for another review
 665: payment >> finish  # After payment, finish the process
 666: 
 667: flow = Flow(start=review)
 668: ```
 669: 
 670: Let's see how it flows:
 671: 
 672: 1. If `review.post()` returns `"approved"`, the expense moves to the `payment` node
 673: 2. If `review.post()` returns `"needs_revision"`, it goes to the `revise` node, which then loops back to `review`
 674: 3. If `review.post()` returns `"rejected"`, it moves to the `finish` node and stops
 675: 
 676: ```mermaid
 677: flowchart TD
 678:     review[Review Expense] -->|approved| payment[Process Payment]
 679:     review -->|needs_revision| revise[Revise Report]
 680:     review -->|rejected| finish[Finish Process]
 681: 
 682:     revise --> review
 683:     payment --> finish
 684: ```
 685: 
 686: ### Running Individual Nodes vs. Running a Flow
 687: 
 688: - `node.run(shared)`: Just runs that node alone (calls `prep->exec->post()`), returns an Action. 
 689: - `flow.run(shared)`: Executes from the start node, follows Actions to the next node, and so on until the flow can't continue.
 690: 
 691: > `node.run(shared)` **does not** proceed to the successor.
 692: > This is mainly for debugging or testing a single node.
 693: > 
 694: > Always use `flow.run(...)` in production to ensure the full pipeline runs correctly.
 695: {: .warning }
 696: 
 697: ## 3. Nested Flows
 698: 
 699: A **Flow** can act like a Node, which enables powerful composition patterns. This means you can:
 700: 
 701: 1. Use a Flow as a Node within another Flow's transitions.  
 702: 2. Combine multiple smaller Flows into a larger Flow for reuse.  
 703: 3. Node `params` will be a merging of **all** parents' `params`.
 704: 
 705: ### Flow's Node Methods
 706: 
 707: A **Flow** is also a **Node**, so it will run `prep()` and `post()`. However:
 708: 
 709: - It **won't** run `exec()`, as its main logic is to orchestrate its nodes.
 710: - `post()` always receives `None` for `exec_res` and should instead get the flow execution results from the shared store.
 711: 
 712: ### Basic Flow Nesting
 713: 
 714: Here's how to connect a flow to another node:
 715: 
 716: ```python
 717: # Create a sub-flow
 718: node_a >> node_b
 719: subflow = Flow(start=node_a)
 720: 
 721: # Connect it to another node
 722: subflow >> node_c
 723: 
 724: # Create the parent flow
 725: parent_flow = Flow(start=subflow)
 726: ```
 727: 
 728: When `parent_flow.run()` executes:
 729: 1. It starts `subflow`
 730: 2. `subflow` runs through its nodes (`node_a->node_b`)
 731: 3. After `subflow` completes, execution continues to `node_c`
 732: 
 733: ### Example: Order Processing Pipeline
 734: 
 735: Here's a practical example that breaks down order processing into nested flows:
 736: 
 737: ```python
 738: # Payment processing sub-flow
 739: validate_payment >> process_payment >> payment_confirmation
 740: payment_flow = Flow(start=validate_payment)
 741: 
 742: # Inventory sub-flow
 743: check_stock >> reserve_items >> update_inventory
 744: inventory_flow = Flow(start=check_stock)
 745: 
 746: # Shipping sub-flow
 747: create_label >> assign_carrier >> schedule_pickup
 748: shipping_flow = Flow(start=create_label)
 749: 
 750: # Connect the flows into a main order pipeline
 751: payment_flow >> inventory_flow >> shipping_flow
 752: 
 753: # Create the master flow
 754: order_pipeline = Flow(start=payment_flow)
 755: 
 756: # Run the entire pipeline
 757: order_pipeline.run(shared_data)
 758: ```
 759: 
 760: This creates a clean separation of concerns while maintaining a clear execution path:
 761: 
 762: ```mermaid
 763: flowchart LR
 764:     subgraph order_pipeline[Order Pipeline]
 765:         subgraph paymentFlow["Payment Flow"]
 766:             A[Validate Payment] --> B[Process Payment] --> C[Payment Confirmation]
 767:         end
 768: 
 769:         subgraph inventoryFlow["Inventory Flow"]
 770:             D[Check Stock] --> E[Reserve Items] --> F[Update Inventory]
 771:         end
 772: 
 773:         subgraph shippingFlow["Shipping Flow"]
 774:             G[Create Label] --> H[Assign Carrier] --> I[Schedule Pickup]
 775:         end
 776: 
 777:         paymentFlow --> inventoryFlow
 778:         inventoryFlow --> shippingFlow
 779:     end
 780: ```

 797:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/node.png?raw=true" width="400"/>
 798: </div>
 799: 
 800: 1. `prep(shared)`
 801:    - **Read and preprocess data** from `shared` store. 
 802:    - Examples: *query DB, read files, or serialize data into a string*.
 803:    - Return `prep_res`, which is used by `exec()` and `post()`.
 804: 
 805: 2. `exec(prep_res)`
 806:    - **Execute compute logic**, with optional retries and error handling (below).
 807:    - Examples: *(mostly) LLM calls, remote APIs, tool use*.
 808:    - ⚠️ This shall be only for compute and **NOT** access `shared`.
 809:    - ⚠️ If retries enabled, ensure idempotent implementation.
 810:    - Return `exec_res`, which is passed to `post()`.
 811: 
 812: 3. `post(shared, prep_res, exec_res)`
 813:    - **Postprocess and write data** back to `shared`.
 814:    - Examples: *update DB, change states, log results*.
 815:    - **Decide the next action** by returning a *string* (`action = "default"` if *None*).
 816: 
 817: > **Why 3 steps?** To enforce the principle of *separation of concerns*. The data storage and data processing are operated separately.
 818: >
 819: > All steps are *optional*. E.g., you can only implement `prep` and `post` if you just need to process data.
 820: {: .note }
 821: 
 822: ### Fault Tolerance & Retries
 823: 
 824: You can **retry** `exec()` if it raises an exception via two parameters when define the Node:
 825: 
 826: - `max_retries` (int): Max times to run `exec()`. The default is `1` (**no** retry).
 827: - `wait` (int): The time to wait (in **seconds**) before next retry. By default, `wait=0` (no waiting). 
 828: `wait` is helpful when you encounter rate-limits or quota errors from your LLM provider and need to back off.
 829: 
 830: ```python 
 831: my_node = SummarizeFile(max_retries=3, wait=10)
 832: ```
 833: 
 834: When an exception occurs in `exec()`, the Node automatically retries until:
 835: 
 836: - It either succeeds, or
 837: - The Node has retried `max_retries - 1` times already and fails on the last attempt.
 838: 
 839: You can get the current retry times (0-based) from `self.cur_retry`.
 840: 
 841: ```python 
 842: class RetryNode(Node):
 843:     def exec(self, prep_res):
 844:         print(f"Retry {self.cur_retry} times")
 845:         raise Exception("Failed")
 846: ```
 847: 
 848: ### Graceful Fallback
 849: 
 850: To **gracefully handle** the exception (after all retries) rather than raising it, override:
 851: 
 852: ```python 
 853: def exec_fallback(self, prep_res, exc):
 854:     raise exc
 855: ```
 856: 
 857: By default, it just re-raises exception. But you can return a fallback result instead, which becomes the `exec_res` passed to `post()`.
 858: 
 859: ### Example: Summarize file
 860: 
 861: ```python 
 862: class SummarizeFile(Node):
 863:     def prep(self, shared):
 864:         return shared["data"]
 865: 
 866:     def exec(self, prep_res):
 867:         if not prep_res:
 868:             return "Empty file content"
 869:         prompt = f"Summarize this text in 10 words: {prep_res}"
 870:         summary = call_llm(prompt)  # might fail
 871:         return summary
 872: 
 873:     def exec_fallback(self, prep_res, exc):
 874:         # Provide a simple fallback instead of crashing
 875:         return "There was an error processing your request."
 876: 
 877:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 878:         shared["summary"] = exec_res
 879:         # Return "default" by not returning
 880: 
 881: summarize_node = SummarizeFile(max_retries=3)
 882: 
 883: # node.run() calls prep->exec->post
 884: # If exec() fails, it retries up to 3 times before calling exec_fallback()
 885: action_result = summarize_node.run(shared)
 886: 
 887: print("Action returned:", action_result)  # "default"
 888: print("Summary stored:", shared["summary"])
 889: ```

 916: ## AsyncParallelBatchNode
 917: 
 918: Like **AsyncBatchNode**, but run `exec_async()` in **parallel**:
 919: 
 920: ```python
 921: class ParallelSummaries(AsyncParallelBatchNode):
 922:     async def prep_async(self, shared):
 923:         # e.g., multiple texts
 924:         return shared["texts"]
 925: 
 926:     async def exec_async(self, text):
 927:         prompt = f"Summarize: {text}"
 928:         return await call_llm_async(prompt)
 929: 
 930:     async def post_async(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list):
 931:         shared["summary"] = "\n\n".join(exec_res_list)
 932:         return "default"
 933: 
 934: node = ParallelSummaries()
 935: flow = AsyncFlow(start=node)
 936: ```
 937: 
 938: ## AsyncParallelBatchFlow
 939: 
 940: Parallel version of **BatchFlow**. Each iteration of the sub-flow runs **concurrently** using different parameters:
 941: 
 942: ```python
 943: class SummarizeMultipleFiles(AsyncParallelBatchFlow):
 944:     async def prep_async(self, shared):
 945:         return [{"filename": f} for f in shared["files"]]
 946: 
 947: sub_flow = AsyncFlow(start=LoadAndSummarizeFile())
 948: parallel_flow = SummarizeMultipleFiles(start=sub_flow)
 949: await parallel_flow.run_async(shared)
 950: ```

 962: # Agent
 963: 
 964: Agent is a powerful design pattern in which nodes can take dynamic actions based on the context.
 965: 
 966: <div align="center">
 967:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/agent.png?raw=true" width="350"/>
 968: </div>
 969: 
 970: ## Implement Agent with Graph
 971: 
 972: 1. **Context and Action:** Implement nodes that supply context and perform actions.  
 973: 2. **Branching:** Use branching to connect each action node to an agent node. Use action to allow the agent to direct the [flow](../core_abstraction/flow.md) between nodes—and potentially loop back for multi-step.
 974: 3. **Agent Node:** Provide a prompt to decide action—for example:
 975: 
 976: ```python
 977: f"""
 978: ### CONTEXT
 979: Task: {task_description}
 980: Previous Actions: {previous_actions}
 981: Current State: {current_state}
 982: 
 983: ### ACTION SPACE
 984: [1] search
 985:   Description: Use web search to get results
 986:   Parameters:
 987:     - query (str): What to search for
 988: 
 989: [2] answer
 990:   Description: Conclude based on the results
 991:   Parameters:
 992:     - result (str): Final answer to provide
 993: 
 994: ### NEXT ACTION
 995: Decide the next action based on the current context and available action space.
 996: Return your response in the following format:
 997: 
 998: ```yaml
 999: thinking: |
1000:     <your step-by-step reasoning process>
1001: action: <action_name>
1002: parameters:
1003:     <parameter_name>: <parameter_value>
1004: ```"""
1005: ```
1006: 
1007: The core of building **high-performance** and **reliable** agents boils down to:
1008: 
1009: 1. **Context Management:** Provide *relevant, minimal context.* For example, rather than including an entire chat history, retrieve the most relevant via [RAG](./rag.md). Even with larger context windows, LLMs still fall victim to ["lost in the middle"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172), overlooking mid-prompt content.
1010: 
1011: 2. **Action Space:** Provide *a well-structured and unambiguous* set of actions—avoiding overlap like separate `read_databases` or  `read_csvs`. Instead, import CSVs into the database.
1012: 
1013: ## Example Good Action Design
1014: 
1015: - **Incremental:** Feed content in manageable chunks (500 lines or 1 page) instead of all at once.
1016: 
1017: - **Overview-zoom-in:** First provide high-level structure (table of contents, summary), then allow drilling into details (raw texts).
1018: 
1019: - **Parameterized/Programmable:** Instead of fixed actions, enable parameterized (columns to select) or programmable (SQL queries) actions, for example, to read CSV files.
1020: 
1021: - **Backtracking:** Let the agent undo the last step instead of restarting entirely, preserving progress when encountering errors or dead ends.
1022: 
1023: ## Example: Search Agent
1024: 
1025: This agent:
1026: 1. Decides whether to search or answer
1027: 2. If searches, loops back to decide if more search needed
1028: 3. Answers when enough context gathered
1029: 
1030: ```python
1031: class DecideAction(Node):
1032:     def prep(self, shared):
1033:         context = shared.get("context", "No previous search")
1034:         query = shared["query"]
1035:         return query, context
1036:         
1037:     def exec(self, inputs):
1038:         query, context = inputs
1039:         prompt = f"""
1040: Given input: {query}
1041: Previous search results: {context}
1042: Should I: 1) Search web for more info 2) Answer with current knowledge
1043: Output in yaml:
1044: ```yaml
1045: action: search/answer
1046: reason: why this action
1047: search_term: search phrase if action is search
1048: ```"""
1049:         resp = call_llm(prompt)
1050:         yaml_str = resp.split("```yaml")[1].split("```")[0].strip()
1051:         result = yaml.safe_load(yaml_str)

1116: # Map Reduce
1117: 
1118: MapReduce is a design pattern suitable when you have either:
1119: - Large input data (e.g., multiple files to process), or
1120: - Large output data (e.g., multiple forms to fill)
1121: 
1122: and there is a logical way to break the task into smaller, ideally independent parts.

1126: </div>
1127: 
1128: You first break down the task using [BatchNode](../core_abstraction/batch.md) in the map phase, followed by aggregation in the reduce phase.
1129:

1190: # RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
1191: 
1192: For certain LLM tasks like answering questions, providing relevant context is essential. One common architecture is a **two-stage** RAG pipeline:
1193: 
1194: <div align="center">
1195:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/rag.png?raw=true" width="400"/>

1197: 
1198: 1. **Offline stage**: Preprocess and index documents ("building the index").
1199: 2. **Online stage**: Given a question, generate answers by retrieving the most relevant context.
1200: 
1201: ---
1202: ## Stage 1: Offline Indexing
1203: 
1204: We create three Nodes:
1205: 1. `ChunkDocs` – [chunks](../utility_function/chunking.md) raw text.
1206: 2. `EmbedDocs` – [embeds](../utility_function/embedding.md) each chunk.
1207: 3. `StoreIndex` – stores embeddings into a [vector database](../utility_function/vector.md).
1208: 
1209: ```python
1210: class ChunkDocs(BatchNode):
1211:     def prep(self, shared):
1212:         # A list of file paths in shared["files"]. We process each file.
1213:         return shared["files"]
1214: 
1215:     def exec(self, filepath):
1216:         # read file content. In real usage, do error handling.
1217:         with open(filepath, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
1218:             text = f.read()
1219:         # chunk by 100 chars each
1220:         chunks = []
1221:         size = 100
1222:         for i in range(0, len(text), size):
1223:             chunks.append(text[i : i + size])
1224:         return chunks
1225:     
1226:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list):
1227:         # exec_res_list is a list of chunk-lists, one per file.
1228:         # flatten them all into a single list of chunks.
1229:         all_chunks = []
1230:         for chunk_list in exec_res_list:
1231:             all_chunks.extend(chunk_list)
1232:         shared["all_chunks"] = all_chunks
1233: 
1234: class EmbedDocs(BatchNode):
1235:     def prep(self, shared):
1236:         return shared["all_chunks"]
1237:

1240: 
1241:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list):
1242:         # Store the list of embeddings.
1243:         shared["all_embeds"] = exec_res_list
1244:         print(f"Total embeddings: {len(exec_res_list)}")
1245: 
1246: class StoreIndex(Node):
1247:     def prep(self, shared):
1248:         # We'll read all embeds from shared.
1249:         return shared["all_embeds"]
1250: 
1251:     def exec(self, all_embeds):
1252:         # Create a vector index (faiss or other DB in real usage).

1262: store_node = StoreIndex()
1263: 
1264: chunk_node >> embed_node >> store_node
1265: 
1266: OfflineFlow = Flow(start=chunk_node)
1267: ```
1268: 
1269: Usage example:
1270: 
1271: ```python
1272: shared = {
1273:     "files": ["doc1.txt", "doc2.txt"],  # any text files
1274: }
1275: OfflineFlow.run(shared)
1276: ```
1277: 
1278: ---
1279: ## Stage 2: Online Query & Answer
1280: 
1281: We have 3 nodes:
1282: 1. `EmbedQuery` – embeds the user’s question.
1283: 2. `RetrieveDocs` – retrieves top chunk from the index.
1284: 3. `GenerateAnswer` – calls the LLM with the question + chunk to produce the final answer.
1285: 
1286: ```python
1287: class EmbedQuery(Node):
1288:     def prep(self, shared):
1289:         return shared["question"]
1290:

1300:         return shared["q_emb"], shared["index"], shared["all_chunks"]
1301: 
1302:     def exec(self, inputs):

1305:         best_id = I[0][0]
1306:         relevant_chunk = chunks[best_id]
1307:         return relevant_chunk
1308: 
1309:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, relevant_chunk):
1310:         shared["retrieved_chunk"] = relevant_chunk
1311:         print("Retrieved chunk:", relevant_chunk[:60], "...")

1325: 
1326: embed_qnode = EmbedQuery()
1327: retrieve_node = RetrieveDocs()
1328: generate_node = GenerateAnswer()
1329: 
1330: embed_qnode >> retrieve_node >> generate_node
1331: OnlineFlow = Flow(start=embed_qnode)
1332: ```
1333: 
1334: Usage example:
1335: 
1336: ```python
1337: # Suppose we already ran OfflineFlow and have:
1338: # shared["all_chunks"], shared["index"], etc.
1339: shared["question"] = "Why do people like cats?"
1340: 
1341: OnlineFlow.run(shared)

1355: # Structured Output
1356: 
1357: In many use cases, you may want the LLM to output a specific structure, such as a list or a dictionary with predefined keys.
1358: 
1359: There are several approaches to achieve a structured output:
1360: - **Prompting** the LLM to strictly return a defined structure.
1361: - Using LLMs that natively support **schema enforcement**.
1362: - **Post-processing** the LLM's response to extract structured content.
1363: 
1364: In practice, **Prompting** is simple and reliable for modern LLMs.
1365: 
1366: ### Example Use Cases

1396: 
1397: ## Prompt Engineering
1398: 
1399: When prompting the LLM to produce **structured** output:
1400: 1. **Wrap** the structure in code fences (e.g., `yaml`).
1401: 2. **Validate** that all required fields exist (and let `Node` handles retry).
1402: 
1403: ### Example Text Summarization
1404: 
1405: ```python
1406: class SummarizeNode(Node):
1407:     def exec(self, prep_res):
1408:         # Suppose `prep_res` is the text to summarize.
1409:         prompt = f"""
1410: Please summarize the following text as YAML, with exactly 3 bullet points
1411: 
1412: {prep_res}
1413: 
1414: Now, output:
1415: ```yaml
1416: summary:
1417:   - bullet 1
1418:   - bullet 2
1419:   - bullet 3
1420: ```"""
1421:         response = call_llm(prompt)
1422:         yaml_str = response.split("```yaml")[1].split("```")[0].strip()
1423: 
1424:         import yaml
1425:         structured_result = yaml.safe_load(yaml_str)
1426: 
1427:         assert "summary" in structured_result
1428:         assert isinstance(structured_result["summary"], list)
1429: 
1430:         return structured_result
1431: ```
1432: 
1433: > Besides using `assert` statements, another popular way to validate schemas is [Pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic)
1434: {: .note }
1435: 
1436: ### Why YAML instead of JSON?
1437: 
1438: Current LLMs struggle with escaping. YAML is easier with strings since they don't always need quotes.
1439: 
1440: **In JSON**  
1441: 
1442: ```json
1443: {
1444:   "dialogue": "Alice said: \"Hello Bob.\\nHow are you?\\nI am good.\""
1445: }
1446: ```
1447: 
1448: - Every double quote inside the string must be escaped with `\"`.
1449: - Each newline in the dialogue must be represented as `\n`.
1450: 
1451: **In YAML**  
1452: 
1453: ```yaml
1454: dialogue: |
1455:   Alice said: "Hello Bob.
1456:   How are you?
1457:   I am good."
1458: ```
1459: 
1460: - No need to escape interior quotes—just place the entire text under a block literal (`|`).
1461: - Newlines are naturally preserved without needing `\n`.

1473: # Workflow
1474: 
1475: Many real-world tasks are too complex for one LLM call. The solution is to **Task Decomposition**: decompose them into a [chain](../core_abstraction/flow.md) of multiple Nodes.

1477: <div align="center">
1478:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/workflow.png?raw=true" width="400"/>
1479: </div>
1480: 
1481: > - You don't want to make each task **too coarse**, because it may be *too complex for one LLM call*.
1482: > - You don't want to make each task **too granular**, because then *the LLM call doesn't have enough context* and results are *not consistent across nodes*.
1483: > 
1484: > You usually need multiple *iterations* to find the *sweet spot*. If the task has too many *edge cases*, consider using [Agents](./agent.md).

1487: ### Example: Article Writing
1488: 
1489: ```python
1490: class GenerateOutline(Node):
1491:     def prep(self, shared): return shared["topic"]
1492:     def exec(self, topic): return call_llm(f"Create a detailed outline for an article about {topic}")
1493:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res): shared["outline"] = exec_res
1494: 
1495: class WriteSection(Node):
1496:     def prep(self, shared): return shared["outline"]
1497:     def exec(self, outline): return call_llm(f"Write content based on this outline: {outline}")
1498:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res): shared["draft"] = exec_res
1499: 
1500: class ReviewAndRefine(Node):
1501:     def prep(self, shared): return shared["draft"]
1502:     def exec(self, draft): return call_llm(f"Review and improve this draft: {draft}")
1503:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res): shared["final_article"] = exec_res
1504: 
1505: # Connect nodes
1506: outline = GenerateOutline()
1507: write = WriteSection()
1508: review = ReviewAndRefine()
1509: 
1510: outline >> write >> review
1511: 
1512: # Create and run flow
1513: writing_flow = Flow(start=outline)
1514: shared = {"topic": "AI Safety"}
1515: writing_flow.run(shared)
1516: ```
1517: 
1518: For *dynamic cases*, consider using [Agents](./agent.md).

1559:             messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
1560:             max_tokens=100
1561:         )
1562:         return response.content
1563:     ```
1564: 
1565: 3. Google (Generative AI Studio / PaLM API)
1566:     ```python
1567:     def call_llm(prompt):
1568:         import google.generativeai as genai
1569:         genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
1570:         response = genai.generate_text(

1572:             prompt=prompt
1573:         )
1574:         return response.result
1575:     ```
1576: 
1577: 4. Azure (Azure OpenAI)
1578:     ```python
1579:     def call_llm(prompt):
1580:         from openai import AzureOpenAI
1581:         client = AzureOpenAI(
1582:             azure_endpoint="https://<YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME>.openai.azure.com/",
1583:             api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",

1600:         )
1601:         return response.message.content
1602:     ```
1603: 
1604: ## Improvements
1605: Feel free to enhance your `call_llm` function as needed. Here are examples:
1606: 
1607: - Handle chat history:
1608: 
1609: ```python
1610: def call_llm(messages):
1611:     from openai import OpenAI
1612:     client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
1613:     r = client.chat.completions.create(
1614:         model="gpt-4o",
1615:         messages=messages
1616:     )
1617:     return r.choices[0].message.content
1618: ```
1619: 
1620: - Add in-memory caching 
1621: 
1622: ```python
1623: from functools import lru_cache
1624: 
1625: @lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
1626: def call_llm(prompt):
1627:     # Your implementation here
1628:     pass
1629: ```
1630: 
1631: > ⚠️ Caching conflicts with Node retries, as retries yield the same result.
1632: >
1633: > To address this, you could use cached results only if not retried.
1634: {: .warning }
1635: 
1636: 
1637: ```python
1638: from functools import lru_cache
1639: 
1640: @lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
1641: def cached_call(prompt):
1642:     pass
1643: 
1644: def call_llm(prompt, use_cache):
1645:     if use_cache:
1646:         return cached_call(prompt)
1647:     # Call the underlying function directly
1648:     return cached_call.__wrapped__(prompt)
1649: 
1650: class SummarizeNode(Node):
1651:     def exec(self, text):
1652:         return call_llm(f"Summarize: {text}", self.cur_retry==0)
1653: ```
1654: 
1655: - Enable logging:
1656: 
1657: ```python
1658: def call_llm(prompt):
1659:     import logging
1660:     logging.info(f"Prompt: {prompt}")
1661:     response = ... # Your implementation here
1662:     logging.info(f"Response: {response}")
1663:     return response

   6: # Agentic Coding: Humans Design, Agents code!
   7: 
   8: > If you are an AI agents involved in building LLM Systems, read this guide **VERY, VERY** carefully! This is the most important chapter in the entire document. Throughout development, you should always (1) start with a small and simple solution, (2) design at a high level (`docs/design.md`) before implementation, and (3) frequently ask humans for feedback and clarification.
   9: {: .warning }
  10: 
  11: ## Agentic Coding Steps
  12: 
  13: Agentic Coding should be a collaboration between Human System Design and Agent Implementation:
  14: 
  15: | Steps                  | Human      | AI        | Comment                                                                 |
  16: |:-----------------------|:----------:|:---------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  17: | 1. Requirements | ★★★ High  | ★☆☆ Low   | Humans understand the requirements and context.                    |
  18: | 2. Flow          | ★★☆ Medium | ★★☆ Medium |  Humans specify the high-level design, and the AI fills in the details. |
  19: | 3. Utilities   | ★★☆ Medium | ★★☆ Medium | Humans provide available external APIs and integrations, and the AI helps with implementation. |
  20: | 4. Node          | ★☆☆ Low   | ★★★ High  | The AI helps design the node types and data handling based on the flow.          |
  21: | 5. Implementation      | ★☆☆ Low   | ★★★ High  |  The AI implements the flow based on the design. |
  22: | 6. Optimization        | ★★☆ Medium | ★★☆ Medium | Humans evaluate the results, and the AI helps optimize. |
  23: | 7. Reliability         | ★☆☆ Low   | ★★★ High  |  The AI writes test cases and addresses corner cases.     |
  24: 
  25: 1. **Requirements**: Clarify the requirements for your project, and evaluate whether an AI system is a good fit. 
  26:     - Understand AI systems' strengths and limitations:
  27:       - **Good for**: Routine tasks requiring common sense (filling forms, replying to emails)
  28:       - **Good for**: Creative tasks with well-defined inputs (building slides, writing SQL)
  29:       - **Not good for**: Ambiguous problems requiring complex decision-making (business strategy, startup planning)
  30:     - **Keep It User-Centric:** Explain the "problem" from the user's perspective rather than just listing features.
  31:     - **Balance complexity vs. impact**: Aim to deliver the highest value features with minimal complexity early.
  32: 
  33: 2. **Flow Design**: Outline at a high level, describe how your AI system orchestrates nodes.
  34:     - Identify applicable design patterns (e.g., [Map Reduce](./design_pattern/mapreduce.md), [Agent](./design_pattern/agent.md), [RAG](./design_pattern/rag.md)).
  35:       - For each node in the flow, start with a high-level one-line description of what it does.
  36:       - If using **Map Reduce**, specify how to map (what to split) and how to reduce (how to combine).
  37:       - If using **Agent**, specify what are the inputs (context) and what are the possible actions.
  38:       - If using **RAG**, specify what to embed, noting that there's usually both offline (indexing) and online (retrieval) workflows.
  39:     - Outline the flow and draw it in a mermaid diagram. For example:
  40:       ```mermaid
  41:       flowchart LR
  42:           start[Start] --> batch[Batch]
  43:           batch --> check[Check]
  44:           check -->|OK| process
  45:           check -->|Error| fix[Fix]
  46:           fix --> check
  47:           
  48:           subgraph process[Process]
  49:             step1[Step 1] --> step2[Step 2]
  50:           end
  51:           
  52:           process --> endNode[End]
  53:       ```
  54:     - > **If Humans can't specify the flow, AI Agents can't automate it!** Before building an LLM system, thoroughly understand the problem and potential solution by manually solving example inputs to develop intuition.  
  55:       {: .best-practice }
  56: 
  57: 3. **Utilities**: Based on the Flow Design, identify and implement necessary utility functions.
  58:     - Think of your AI system as the brain. It needs a body—these *external utility functions*—to interact with the real world:
  59:         <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/utility.png?raw=true" width="400"/></div>
  60: 
  61:         - Reading inputs (e.g., retrieving Slack messages, reading emails)
  62:         - Writing outputs (e.g., generating reports, sending emails)
  63:         - Using external tools (e.g., calling LLMs, searching the web)
  64:         - **NOTE**: *LLM-based tasks* (e.g., summarizing text, analyzing sentiment) are **NOT** utility functions; rather, they are *core functions* internal in the AI system.
  65:     - For each utility function, implement it and write a simple test.
  66:     - Document their input/output, as well as why they are necessary. For example:
  67:       - `name`: `get_embedding` (`utils/get_embedding.py`)
  68:       - `input`: `str`
  69:       - `output`: a vector of 3072 floats
  70:       - `necessity`: Used by the second node to embed text
  71:     - Example utility implementation:
  72:       ```python
  73:       # utils/call_llm.py
  74:       from openai import OpenAI
  75: 
  76:       def call_llm(prompt):    
  77:           client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
  78:           r = client.chat.completions.create(
  79:               model="gpt-4o",
  80:               messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
  81:           )
  82:           return r.choices[0].message.content
  83:           
  84:       if __name__ == "__main__":
  85:           prompt = "What is the meaning of life?"
  86:           print(call_llm(prompt))
  87:       ```
  88:     - > **Sometimes, design Utilies before Flow:**  For example, for an LLM project to automate a legacy system, the bottleneck will likely be the available interface to that system. Start by designing the hardest utilities for interfacing, and then build the flow around them.
  89:       {: .best-practice }
  90: 
  91: 4. **Node Design**: Plan how each node will read and write data, and use utility functions.
  92:    - One core design principle for PocketFlow is to use a [shared store](./core_abstraction/communication.md), so start with a shared store design:
  93:       - For simple systems, use an in-memory dictionary.
  94:       - For more complex systems or when persistence is required, use a database.
  95:       - **Don't Repeat Yourself**: Use in-memory references or foreign keys.
  96:       - Example shared store design:
  97:         ```python
  98:         shared = {
  99:             "user": {
 100:                 "id": "user123",
 101:                 "context": {                # Another nested dict
 102:                     "weather": {"temp": 72, "condition": "sunny"},
 103:                     "location": "San Francisco"
 104:                 }
 105:             },
 106:             "results": {}                   # Empty dict to store outputs
 107:         }
 108:         ```
 109:    - For each [Node](./core_abstraction/node.md), describe its type, how it reads and writes data, and which utility function it uses. Keep it specific but high-level without codes. For example:
 110:      - `type`: Regular (or Batch, or Async)
 111:      - `prep`: Read "text" from the shared store
 112:      - `exec`: Call the embedding utility function
 113:      - `post`: Write "embedding" to the shared store
 114: 
 115: 5. **Implementation**: Implement the initial nodes and flows based on the design.
 116:    - 🎉 If you've reached this step, humans have finished the design. Now *Agentic Coding* begins!
 117:    - **"Keep it simple, stupid!"** Avoid complex features and full-scale type checking.
 118:    - **FAIL FAST**! Avoid `try` logic so you can quickly identify any weak points in the system.
 119:    - Add logging throughout the code to facilitate debugging.
 120: 
 121: 7. **Optimization**:
 122:    - **Use Intuition**: For a quick initial evaluation, human intuition is often a good start.
 123:    - **Redesign Flow (Back to Step 3)**: Consider breaking down tasks further, introducing agentic decisions, or better managing input contexts.
 124:    - If your flow design is already solid, move on to micro-optimizations:
 125:      - **Prompt Engineering**: Use clear, specific instructions with examples to reduce ambiguity.
 126:      - **In-Context Learning**: Provide robust examples for tasks that are difficult to specify with instructions alone.
 127: 
 128:    - > **You'll likely iterate a lot!** Expect to repeat Steps 3–6 hundreds of times.

 131:      {: .best-practice }
 132: 
 133: 8. **Reliability**  
 134:    - **Node Retries**: Add checks in the node `exec` to ensure outputs meet requirements, and consider increasing `max_retries` and `wait` times.
 135:    - **Logging and Visualization**: Maintain logs of all attempts and visualize node results for easier debugging.
 136:    - **Self-Evaluation**: Add a separate node (powered by an LLM) to review outputs when results are uncertain.

 153: 
 154: - **`docs/design.md`**: Contains project documentation for each step above. This should be *high-level* and *no-code*.
 155: - **`utils/`**: Contains all utility functions.
 156:   - It's recommended to dedicate one Python file to each API call, for example `call_llm.py` or `search_web.py`.
 157:   - Each file should also include a `main()` function to try that API call
 158: - **`nodes.py`**: Contains all the node definitions.
 159:   ```python
 160:   # nodes.py
 161:   from pocketflow import Node
 162:   from utils.call_llm import call_llm
 163: 
 164:   class GetQuestionNode(Node):
 165:       def exec(self, _):
 166:           # Get question directly from user input
 167:           user_question = input("Enter your question: ")

 185:           # Store the answer in shared
 186:           shared["answer"] = exec_res
 187:   ```
 188: - **`flow.py`**: Implements functions that create flows by importing node definitions and connecting them.
 189:   ```python
 190:   # flow.py
 191:   from pocketflow import Flow

 199:       
 200:       # Connect nodes in sequence
 201:       get_question_node >> answer_node
 202:       
 203:       # Create flow starting with input node
 204:       return Flow(start=get_question_node)
 205:   ```
 206: - **`main.py`**: Serves as the project's entry point.
 207:   ```python
 208:   # main.py
 209:   from flow import create_qa_flow
 210: 
 211:   # Example main function

 238: # Pocket Flow
 239: 
 240: A [100-line](https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/blob/main/pocketflow/__init__.py) minimalist LLM framework for *Agents, Task Decomposition, RAG, etc*.
 241: 
 242: - **Lightweight**: Just the core graph abstraction in 100 lines. ZERO dependencies, and vendor lock-in.
 243: - **Expressive**: Everything you love from larger frameworks—([Multi-](./design_pattern/multi_agent.html))[Agents](./design_pattern/agent.html), [Workflow](./design_pattern/workflow.html), [RAG](./design_pattern/rag.html), and more.  
 244: - **Agentic-Coding**: Intuitive enough for AI agents to help humans build complex LLM applications.
 245: 
 246: <div align="center">
 247:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/meme.jpg?raw=true" width="400"/>
 248: </div>
 249: 
 250: ## Core Abstraction
 251: 
 252: We model the LLM workflow as a **Graph + Shared Store**:
 253: 
 254: - [Node](./core_abstraction/node.md) handles simple (LLM) tasks.
 255: - [Flow](./core_abstraction/flow.md) connects nodes through **Actions** (labeled edges).
 256: - [Shared Store](./core_abstraction/communication.md) enables communication between nodes within flows.
 257: - [Batch](./core_abstraction/batch.md) nodes/flows allow for data-intensive tasks.
 258: - [Async](./core_abstraction/async.md) nodes/flows allow waiting for asynchronous tasks.
 259: - [(Advanced) Parallel](./core_abstraction/parallel.md) nodes/flows handle I/O-bound tasks.
 260: 
 261: <div align="center">
 262:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/abstraction.png" width="500"/>
 263: </div>
 264: 
 265: ## Design Pattern
 266: 
 267: From there, it’s easy to implement popular design patterns:
 268: 
 269: - [Agent](./design_pattern/agent.md) autonomously makes decisions.
 270: - [Workflow](./design_pattern/workflow.md) chains multiple tasks into pipelines.
 271: - [RAG](./design_pattern/rag.md) integrates data retrieval with generation.
 272: - [Map Reduce](./design_pattern/mapreduce.md) splits data tasks into Map and Reduce steps.
 273: - [Structured Output](./design_pattern/structure.md) formats outputs consistently.
 274: - [(Advanced) Multi-Agents](./design_pattern/multi_agent.md) coordinate multiple agents.
 275: 
 276: <div align="center">
 277:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/design.png" width="500"/>
 278: </div>
 279: 
 280: ## Utility Function
 281: 
 282: We **do not** provide built-in utilities. Instead, we offer *examples*—please *implement your own*:
 283: 
 284: - [LLM Wrapper](./utility_function/llm.md)
 285: - [Viz and Debug](./utility_function/viz.md)
 286: - [Web Search](./utility_function/websearch.md)
 287: - [Chunking](./utility_function/chunking.md)
 288: - [Embedding](./utility_function/embedding.md)
 289: - [Vector Databases](./utility_function/vector.md)
 290: - [Text-to-Speech](./utility_function/text_to_speech.md)
 291: 
 292: **Why not built-in?**: I believe it's a *bad practice* for vendor-specific APIs in a general framework:
 293: - *API Volatility*: Frequent changes lead to heavy maintenance for hardcoded APIs.
 294: - *Flexibility*: You may want to switch vendors, use fine-tuned models, or run them locally.
 295: - *Optimizations*: Prompt caching, batching, and streaming are easier without vendor lock-in.

 311: # (Advanced) Async
 312: 
 313: **Async** Nodes implement `prep_async()`, `exec_async()`, `exec_fallback_async()`, and/or `post_async()`. This is useful for:
 314: 
 315: 1. **prep_async()**: For *fetching/reading data (files, APIs, DB)* in an I/O-friendly way.
 316: 2. **exec_async()**: Typically used for async LLM calls.
 317: 3. **post_async()**: For *awaiting user feedback*, *coordinating across multi-agents* or any additional async steps after `exec_async()`.
 318: 
 319: **Note**: `AsyncNode` must be wrapped in `AsyncFlow`. `AsyncFlow` can also include regular (sync) nodes.
 320: 
 321: ### Example
 322: 
 323: ```python
 324: class SummarizeThenVerify(AsyncNode):
 325:     async def prep_async(self, shared):
 326:         # Example: read a file asynchronously
 327:         doc_text = await read_file_async(shared["doc_path"])
 328:         return doc_text
 329: 
 330:     async def exec_async(self, prep_res):
 331:         # Example: async LLM call
 332:         summary = await call_llm_async(f"Summarize: {prep_res}")
 333:         return summary
 334: 
 335:     async def post_async(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 336:         # Example: wait for user feedback
 337:         decision = await gather_user_feedback(exec_res)
 338:         if decision == "approve":
 339:             shared["summary"] = exec_res
 340:             return "approve"
 341:         return "deny"
 342: 
 343: summarize_node = SummarizeThenVerify()
 344: final_node = Finalize()
 345: 
 346: # Define transitions
 347: summarize_node - "approve" >> final_node
 348: summarize_node - "deny"    >> summarize_node  # retry
 349: 
 350: flow = AsyncFlow(start=summarize_node)
 351: 
 352: async def main():
 353:     shared = {"doc_path": "document.txt"}
 354:     await flow.run_async(shared)
 355:     print("Final Summary:", shared.get("summary"))
 356: 
 357: asyncio.run(main())
 358: ```

 367: nav_order: 4
 368: ---
 369: 
 370: # Batch
 371: 
 372: **Batch** makes it easier to handle large inputs in one Node or **rerun** a Flow multiple times. Example use cases:
 373: - **Chunk-based** processing (e.g., splitting large texts).
 374: - **Iterative** processing over lists of input items (e.g., user queries, files, URLs).
 375: 
 376: ## 1. BatchNode
 377: 
 378: A **BatchNode** extends `Node` but changes `prep()` and `exec()`:
 379: 
 380: - **`prep(shared)`**: returns an **iterable** (e.g., list, generator).
 381: - **`exec(item)`**: called **once** per item in that iterable.
 382: - **`post(shared, prep_res, exec_res_list)`**: after all items are processed, receives a **list** of results (`exec_res_list`) and returns an **Action**.
 383: 
 384: 
 385: ### Example: Summarize a Large File
 386: 
 387: ```python
 388: class MapSummaries(BatchNode):
 389:     def prep(self, shared):
 390:         # Suppose we have a big file; chunk it
 391:         content = shared["data"]
 392:         chunk_size = 10000
 393:         chunks = [content[i:i+chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(content), chunk_size)]
 394:         return chunks
 395: 
 396:     def exec(self, chunk):
 397:         prompt = f"Summarize this chunk in 10 words: {chunk}"
 398:         summary = call_llm(prompt)
 399:         return summary
 400: 
 401:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list):
 402:         combined = "\n".join(exec_res_list)
 403:         shared["summary"] = combined
 404:         return "default"
 405: 
 406: map_summaries = MapSummaries()
 407: flow = Flow(start=map_summaries)
 408: flow.run(shared)
 409: ```
 410: 
 411: ---
 412: 
 413: ## 2. BatchFlow
 414: 
 415: A **BatchFlow** runs a **Flow** multiple times, each time with different `params`. Think of it as a loop that replays the Flow for each parameter set.
 416: 
 417: ### Example: Summarize Many Files
 418: 
 419: ```python
 420: class SummarizeAllFiles(BatchFlow):
 421:     def prep(self, shared):
 422:         # Return a list of param dicts (one per file)
 423:         filenames = list(shared["data"].keys())  # e.g., ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", ...]
 424:         return [{"filename": fn} for fn in filenames]
 425: 
 426: # Suppose we have a per-file Flow (e.g., load_file >> summarize >> reduce):
 427: summarize_file = SummarizeFile(start=load_file)
 428: 
 429: # Wrap that flow into a BatchFlow:
 430: summarize_all_files = SummarizeAllFiles(start=summarize_file)
 431: summarize_all_files.run(shared)
 432: ```
 433: 
 434: ### Under the Hood
 435: 1. `prep(shared)` returns a list of param dicts—e.g., `[{filename: "file1.txt"}, {filename: "file2.txt"}, ...]`.
 436: 2. The **BatchFlow** loops through each dict. For each one:
 437:    - It merges the dict with the BatchFlow’s own `params`.
 438:    - It calls `flow.run(shared)` using the merged result.
 439: 3. This means the sub-Flow is run **repeatedly**, once for every param dict.
 440: 
 441: ---
 442: 
 443: ## 3. Nested or Multi-Level Batches
 444: 
 445: You can nest a **BatchFlow** in another **BatchFlow**. For instance:
 446: - **Outer** batch: returns a list of diretory param dicts (e.g., `{"directory": "/pathA"}`, `{"directory": "/pathB"}`, ...).
 447: - **Inner** batch: returning a list of per-file param dicts.
 448: 
 449: At each level, **BatchFlow** merges its own param dict with the parent’s. By the time you reach the **innermost** node, the final `params` is the merged result of **all** parents in the chain. This way, a nested structure can keep track of the entire context (e.g., directory + file name) at once.
 450: 
 451: ```python
 452: 
 453: class FileBatchFlow(BatchFlow):
 454:     def prep(self, shared):
 455:         directory = self.params["directory"]
 456:         # e.g., files = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", ...]
 457:         files = [f for f in os.listdir(directory) if f.endswith(".txt")]
 458:         return [{"filename": f} for f in files]
 459: 
 460: class DirectoryBatchFlow(BatchFlow):
 461:     def prep(self, shared):
 462:         directories = [ "/path/to/dirA", "/path/to/dirB"]
 463:         return [{"directory": d} for d in directories]
 464: 
 465: # MapSummaries have params like {"directory": "/path/to/dirA", "filename": "file1.txt"}
 466: inner_flow = FileBatchFlow(start=MapSummaries())
 467: outer_flow = DirectoryBatchFlow(start=inner_flow)
 468: ```

 480: # Communication
 481: 
 482: Nodes and Flows **communicate** in 2 ways:
 483: 
 484: 1. **Shared Store (for almost all the cases)** 
 485: 
 486:    - A global data structure (often an in-mem dict) that all nodes can read ( `prep()`) and write (`post()`).  
 487:    - Great for data results, large content, or anything multiple nodes need.
 488:    - You shall design the data structure and populate it ahead.
 489:      
 490:    - > **Separation of Concerns:** Use `Shared Store` for almost all cases to separate *Data Schema* from *Compute Logic*!  This approach is both flexible and easy to manage, resulting in more maintainable code. `Params` is more a syntax sugar for [Batch](./batch.md).
 491:      {: .best-practice }
 492: 
 493: 2. **Params (only for [Batch](./batch.md))** 
 494:    - Each node has a local, ephemeral `params` dict passed in by the **parent Flow**, used as an identifier for tasks. Parameter keys and values shall be **immutable**.
 495:    - Good for identifiers like filenames or numeric IDs, in Batch mode.
 496: 
 497: If you know memory management, think of the **Shared Store** like a **heap** (shared by all function calls), and **Params** like a **stack** (assigned by the caller).
 498:

 500: 
 501: ## 1. Shared Store
 502: 
 503: ### Overview
 504: 
 505: A shared store is typically an in-mem dictionary, like:
 506: ```python
 507: shared = {"data": {}, "summary": {}, "config": {...}, ...}
 508: ```
 509: 
 510: It can also contain local file handlers, DB connections, or a combination for persistence. We recommend deciding the data structure or DB schema first based on your app requirements.
 511: 
 512: ### Example
 513: 
 514: ```python
 515: class LoadData(Node):
 516:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 517:         # We write data to shared store
 518:         shared["data"] = "Some text content"
 519:         return None
 520: 
 521: class Summarize(Node):
 522:     def prep(self, shared):
 523:         # We read data from shared store
 524:         return shared["data"]
 525: 
 526:     def exec(self, prep_res):
 527:         # Call LLM to summarize
 528:         prompt = f"Summarize: {prep_res}"
 529:         summary = call_llm(prompt)
 530:         return summary
 531: 
 532:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 533:         # We write summary to shared store
 534:         shared["summary"] = exec_res
 535:         return "default"
 536: 
 537: load_data = LoadData()
 538: summarize = Summarize()
 539: load_data >> summarize
 540: flow = Flow(start=load_data)
 541: 
 542: shared = {}
 543: flow.run(shared)
 544: ```
 545: 
 546: Here:
 547: - `LoadData` writes to `shared["data"]`.
 548: - `Summarize` reads from `shared["data"]`, summarizes, and writes to `shared["summary"]`.
 549: 
 550: ---
 551: 
 552: ## 2. Params
 553: 
 554: **Params** let you store *per-Node* or *per-Flow* config that doesn't need to live in the shared store. They are:
 555: - **Immutable** during a Node's run cycle (i.e., they don't change mid-`prep->exec->post`).
 556: - **Set** via `set_params()`.
 557: - **Cleared** and updated each time a parent Flow calls it.
 558: 
 559: > Only set the uppermost Flow params because others will be overwritten by the parent Flow. 
 560: > 
 561: > If you need to set child node params, see [Batch](./batch.md).
 562: {: .warning }
 563: 
 564: Typically, **Params** are identifiers (e.g., file name, page number). Use them to fetch the task you assigned or write to a specific part of the shared store.
 565: 
 566: ### Example
 567: 
 568: ```python
 569: # 1) Create a Node that uses params
 570: class SummarizeFile(Node):
 571:     def prep(self, shared):
 572:         # Access the node's param
 573:         filename = self.params["filename"]
 574:         return shared["data"].get(filename, "")
 575: 
 576:     def exec(self, prep_res):
 577:         prompt = f"Summarize: {prep_res}"
 578:         return call_llm(prompt)
 579: 
 580:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 581:         filename = self.params["filename"]
 582:         shared["summary"][filename] = exec_res
 583:         return "default"
 584: 
 585: # 2) Set params
 586: node = SummarizeFile()
 587: 
 588: # 3) Set Node params directly (for testing)
 589: node.set_params({"filename": "doc1.txt"})
 590: node.run(shared)
 591: 
 592: # 4) Create Flow
 593: flow = Flow(start=node)
 594: 
 595: # 5) Set Flow params (overwrites node params)
 596: flow.set_params({"filename": "doc2.txt"})
 597: flow.run(shared)  # The node summarizes doc2, not doc1
 598: ```

 609: 
 610: # Flow
 611: 
 612: A **Flow** orchestrates a graph of Nodes. You can chain Nodes in a sequence or create branching depending on the **Actions** returned from each Node's `post()`.
 613: 
 614: ## 1. Action-based Transitions
 615: 
 616: Each Node's `post()` returns an **Action** string. By default, if `post()` doesn't return anything, we treat that as `"default"`.
 617: 
 618: You define transitions with the syntax:
 619: 
 620: 1. **Basic default transition**: `node_a >> node_b`
 621:   This means if `node_a.post()` returns `"default"`, go to `node_b`. 
 622:   (Equivalent to `node_a - "default" >> node_b`)
 623: 
 624: 2. **Named action transition**: `node_a - "action_name" >> node_b`
 625:   This means if `node_a.post()` returns `"action_name"`, go to `node_b`.
 626: 
 627: It's possible to create loops, branching, or multi-step flows.
 628: 
 629: ## 2. Creating a Flow
 630: 
 631: A **Flow** begins with a **start** node. You call `Flow(start=some_node)` to specify the entry point. When you call `flow.run(shared)`, it executes the start node, looks at its returned Action from `post()`, follows the transition, and continues until there's no next node.
 632: 
 633: ### Example: Simple Sequence
 634: 
 635: Here's a minimal flow of two nodes in a chain:
 636: 
 637: ```python
 638: node_a >> node_b
 639: flow = Flow(start=node_a)
 640: flow.run(shared)
 641: ```
 642: 
 643: - When you run the flow, it executes `node_a`.  
 644: - Suppose `node_a.post()` returns `"default"`.  
 645: - The flow then sees `"default"` Action is linked to `node_b` and runs `node_b`.  
 646: - `node_b.post()` returns `"default"` but we didn't define `node_b >> something_else`. So the flow ends there.
 647: 
 648: ### Example: Branching & Looping
 649: 
 650: Here's a simple expense approval flow that demonstrates branching and looping. The `ReviewExpense` node can return three possible Actions:
 651: 
 652: - `"approved"`: expense is approved, move to payment processing
 653: - `"needs_revision"`: expense needs changes, send back for revision 
 654: - `"rejected"`: expense is denied, finish the process
 655: 
 656: We can wire them like this:
 657: 
 658: ```python
 659: # Define the flow connections
 660: review - "approved" >> payment        # If approved, process payment
 661: review - "needs_revision" >> revise   # If needs changes, go to revision
 662: review - "rejected" >> finish         # If rejected, finish the process
 663: 
 664: revise >> review   # After revision, go back for another review
 665: payment >> finish  # After payment, finish the process
 666: 
 667: flow = Flow(start=review)
 668: ```
 669: 
 670: Let's see how it flows:
 671: 
 672: 1. If `review.post()` returns `"approved"`, the expense moves to the `payment` node
 673: 2. If `review.post()` returns `"needs_revision"`, it goes to the `revise` node, which then loops back to `review`
 674: 3. If `review.post()` returns `"rejected"`, it moves to the `finish` node and stops
 675: 
 676: ```mermaid
 677: flowchart TD
 678:     review[Review Expense] -->|approved| payment[Process Payment]
 679:     review -->|needs_revision| revise[Revise Report]
 680:     review -->|rejected| finish[Finish Process]
 681: 
 682:     revise --> review
 683:     payment --> finish
 684: ```
 685: 
 686: ### Running Individual Nodes vs. Running a Flow
 687: 
 688: - `node.run(shared)`: Just runs that node alone (calls `prep->exec->post()`), returns an Action. 
 689: - `flow.run(shared)`: Executes from the start node, follows Actions to the next node, and so on until the flow can't continue.
 690: 
 691: > `node.run(shared)` **does not** proceed to the successor.
 692: > This is mainly for debugging or testing a single node.
 693: > 
 694: > Always use `flow.run(...)` in production to ensure the full pipeline runs correctly.
 695: {: .warning }
 696: 
 697: ## 3. Nested Flows
 698: 
 699: A **Flow** can act like a Node, which enables powerful composition patterns. This means you can:
 700: 
 701: 1. Use a Flow as a Node within another Flow's transitions.  
 702: 2. Combine multiple smaller Flows into a larger Flow for reuse.  
 703: 3. Node `params` will be a merging of **all** parents' `params`.
 704: 
 705: ### Flow's Node Methods
 706: 
 707: A **Flow** is also a **Node**, so it will run `prep()` and `post()`. However:
 708: 
 709: - It **won't** run `exec()`, as its main logic is to orchestrate its nodes.
 710: - `post()` always receives `None` for `exec_res` and should instead get the flow execution results from the shared store.
 711: 
 712: ### Basic Flow Nesting
 713: 
 714: Here's how to connect a flow to another node:
 715: 
 716: ```python
 717: # Create a sub-flow
 718: node_a >> node_b
 719: subflow = Flow(start=node_a)
 720: 
 721: # Connect it to another node
 722: subflow >> node_c
 723: 
 724: # Create the parent flow
 725: parent_flow = Flow(start=subflow)
 726: ```
 727: 
 728: When `parent_flow.run()` executes:
 729: 1. It starts `subflow`
 730: 2. `subflow` runs through its nodes (`node_a->node_b`)
 731: 3. After `subflow` completes, execution continues to `node_c`
 732: 
 733: ### Example: Order Processing Pipeline
 734: 
 735: Here's a practical example that breaks down order processing into nested flows:
 736: 
 737: ```python
 738: # Payment processing sub-flow
 739: validate_payment >> process_payment >> payment_confirmation
 740: payment_flow = Flow(start=validate_payment)
 741: 
 742: # Inventory sub-flow
 743: check_stock >> reserve_items >> update_inventory
 744: inventory_flow = Flow(start=check_stock)
 745: 
 746: # Shipping sub-flow
 747: create_label >> assign_carrier >> schedule_pickup
 748: shipping_flow = Flow(start=create_label)
 749: 
 750: # Connect the flows into a main order pipeline
 751: payment_flow >> inventory_flow >> shipping_flow
 752: 
 753: # Create the master flow
 754: order_pipeline = Flow(start=payment_flow)
 755: 
 756: # Run the entire pipeline
 757: order_pipeline.run(shared_data)
 758: ```
 759: 
 760: This creates a clean separation of concerns while maintaining a clear execution path:
 761: 
 762: ```mermaid
 763: flowchart LR
 764:     subgraph order_pipeline[Order Pipeline]
 765:         subgraph paymentFlow["Payment Flow"]
 766:             A[Validate Payment] --> B[Process Payment] --> C[Payment Confirmation]
 767:         end
 768: 
 769:         subgraph inventoryFlow["Inventory Flow"]
 770:             D[Check Stock] --> E[Reserve Items] --> F[Update Inventory]
 771:         end
 772: 
 773:         subgraph shippingFlow["Shipping Flow"]
 774:             G[Create Label] --> H[Assign Carrier] --> I[Schedule Pickup]
 775:         end
 776: 
 777:         paymentFlow --> inventoryFlow
 778:         inventoryFlow --> shippingFlow
 779:     end
 780: ```

 793: 
 794: A **Node** is the smallest building block. Each Node has 3 steps `prep->exec->post`:

 797:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/node.png?raw=true" width="400"/>
 798: </div>
 799: 
 800: 1. `prep(shared)`
 801:    - **Read and preprocess data** from `shared` store. 
 802:    - Examples: *query DB, read files, or serialize data into a string*.
 803:    - Return `prep_res`, which is used by `exec()` and `post()`.
 804: 
 805: 2. `exec(prep_res)`
 806:    - **Execute compute logic**, with optional retries and error handling (below).
 807:    - Examples: *(mostly) LLM calls, remote APIs, tool use*.
 808:    - ⚠️ This shall be only for compute and **NOT** access `shared`.
 809:    - ⚠️ If retries enabled, ensure idempotent implementation.
 810:    - Return `exec_res`, which is passed to `post()`.
 811: 
 812: 3. `post(shared, prep_res, exec_res)`
 813:    - **Postprocess and write data** back to `shared`.
 814:    - Examples: *update DB, change states, log results*.
 815:    - **Decide the next action** by returning a *string* (`action = "default"` if *None*).
 816: 
 817: > **Why 3 steps?** To enforce the principle of *separation of concerns*. The data storage and data processing are operated separately.
 818: >
 819: > All steps are *optional*. E.g., you can only implement `prep` and `post` if you just need to process data.
 820: {: .note }
 821: 
 822: ### Fault Tolerance & Retries
 823: 
 824: You can **retry** `exec()` if it raises an exception via two parameters when define the Node:
 825: 
 826: - `max_retries` (int): Max times to run `exec()`. The default is `1` (**no** retry).
 827: - `wait` (int): The time to wait (in **seconds**) before next retry. By default, `wait=0` (no waiting). 
 828: `wait` is helpful when you encounter rate-limits or quota errors from your LLM provider and need to back off.
 829: 
 830: ```python 
 831: my_node = SummarizeFile(max_retries=3, wait=10)
 832: ```
 833: 
 834: When an exception occurs in `exec()`, the Node automatically retries until:
 835: 
 836: - It either succeeds, or
 837: - The Node has retried `max_retries - 1` times already and fails on the last attempt.
 838: 
 839: You can get the current retry times (0-based) from `self.cur_retry`.
 840: 
 841: ```python 
 842: class RetryNode(Node):
 843:     def exec(self, prep_res):
 844:         print(f"Retry {self.cur_retry} times")
 845:         raise Exception("Failed")
 846: ```
 847: 
 848: ### Graceful Fallback
 849: 
 850: To **gracefully handle** the exception (after all retries) rather than raising it, override:
 851: 
 852: ```python 
 853: def exec_fallback(self, prep_res, exc):
 854:     raise exc
 855: ```
 856: 
 857: By default, it just re-raises exception. But you can return a fallback result instead, which becomes the `exec_res` passed to `post()`.
 858: 
 859: ### Example: Summarize file
 860: 
 861: ```python 
 862: class SummarizeFile(Node):
 863:     def prep(self, shared):
 864:         return shared["data"]
 865: 
 866:     def exec(self, prep_res):
 867:         if not prep_res:
 868:             return "Empty file content"
 869:         prompt = f"Summarize this text in 10 words: {prep_res}"
 870:         summary = call_llm(prompt)  # might fail
 871:         return summary
 872: 
 873:     def exec_fallback(self, prep_res, exc):
 874:         # Provide a simple fallback instead of crashing
 875:         return "There was an error processing your request."
 876: 
 877:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
 878:         shared["summary"] = exec_res
 879:         # Return "default" by not returning
 880: 
 881: summarize_node = SummarizeFile(max_retries=3)
 882: 
 883: # node.run() calls prep->exec->post
 884: # If exec() fails, it retries up to 3 times before calling exec_fallback()
 885: action_result = summarize_node.run(shared)
 886: 
 887: print("Action returned:", action_result)  # "default"
 888: print("Summary stored:", shared["summary"])
 889: ```

 905: 
 906: > Because of Python’s GIL, parallel nodes and flows can’t truly parallelize CPU-bound tasks (e.g., heavy numerical computations). However, they excel at overlapping I/O-bound work—like LLM calls, database queries, API requests, or file I/O.

 909: > - **Ensure Tasks Are Independent**: If each item depends on the output of a previous item, **do not** parallelize.

 970: ## Implement Agent with Graph
 971: 
 972: 1. **Context and Action:** Implement nodes that supply context and perform actions.  
 973: 2. **Branching:** Use branching to connect each action node to an agent node. Use action to allow the agent to direct the [flow](../core_abstraction/flow.md) between nodes—and potentially loop back for multi-step.
 974: 3. **Agent Node:** Provide a prompt to decide action—for example:
 975: 
 976: ```python
 977: f"""
 978: ### CONTEXT
 979: Task: {task_description}
 980: Previous Actions: {previous_actions}
 981: Current State: {current_state}
 982: 
 983: ### ACTION SPACE
 984: [1] search
 985:   Description: Use web search to get results
 986:   Parameters:
 987:     - query (str): What to search for
 988: 
 989: [2] answer
 990:   Description: Conclude based on the results
 991:   Parameters:
 992:     - result (str): Final answer to provide
 993: 
 994: ### NEXT ACTION
 995: Decide the next action based on the current context and available action space.
 996: Return your response in the following format:
 997: 
 998: ```yaml
 999: thinking: |
1000:     <your step-by-step reasoning process>
1001: action: <action_name>
1002: parameters:
1003:     <parameter_name>: <parameter_value>
1004: ```"""
1005: ```
1006: 
1007: The core of building **high-performance** and **reliable** agents boils down to:
1008: 
1009: 1. **Context Management:** Provide *relevant, minimal context.* For example, rather than including an entire chat history, retrieve the most relevant via [RAG](./rag.md). Even with larger context windows, LLMs still fall victim to ["lost in the middle"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172), overlooking mid-prompt content.
1010: 
1011: 2. **Action Space:** Provide *a well-structured and unambiguous* set of actions—avoiding overlap like separate `read_databases` or  `read_csvs`. Instead, import CSVs into the database.
1012: 
1013: ## Example Good Action Design
1014: 
1015: - **Incremental:** Feed content in manageable chunks (500 lines or 1 page) instead of all at once.
1016: 
1017: - **Overview-zoom-in:** First provide high-level structure (table of contents, summary), then allow drilling into details (raw texts).
1018: 
1019: - **Parameterized/Programmable:** Instead of fixed actions, enable parameterized (columns to select) or programmable (SQL queries) actions, for example, to read CSV files.
1020: 
1021: - **Backtracking:** Let the agent undo the last step instead of restarting entirely, preserving progress when encountering errors or dead ends.
1022: 
1023: ## Example: Search Agent
1024: 
1025: This agent:
1026: 1. Decides whether to search or answer
1027: 2. If searches, loops back to decide if more search needed
1028: 3. Answers when enough context gathered
1029: 
1030: ```python
1031: class DecideAction(Node):
1032:     def prep(self, shared):
1033:         context = shared.get("context", "No previous search")
1034:         query = shared["query"]
1035:         return query, context
1036:         
1037:     def exec(self, inputs):
1038:         query, context = inputs
1039:         prompt = f"""
1040: Given input: {query}
1041: Previous search results: {context}
1042: Should I: 1) Search web for more info 2) Answer with current knowledge
1043: Output in yaml:
1044: ```yaml
1045: action: search/answer
1046: reason: why this action
1047: search_term: search phrase if action is search
1048: ```"""

1116: # Map Reduce
1117: 
1118: MapReduce is a design pattern suitable when you have either:
1119: - Large input data (e.g., multiple files to process), or
1120: - Large output data (e.g., multiple forms to fill)
1121: 
1122: and there is a logical way to break the task into smaller, ideally independent parts. 
1123: 
1124: <div align="center">
1125:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/mapreduce.png?raw=true" width="400"/>
1126: </div>
1127: 
1128: You first break down the task using [BatchNode](../core_abstraction/batch.md) in the map phase, followed by aggregation in the reduce phase.
1129: 
1130: ### Example: Document Summarization
1131: 
1132: ```python
1133: class SummarizeAllFiles(BatchNode):

1135:         files_dict = shared["files"]  # e.g. 10 files
1136:         return list(files_dict.items())  # [("file1.txt", "aaa..."), ("file2.txt", "bbb..."), ...]
1137: 
1138:     def exec(self, one_file):
1139:         filename, file_content = one_file
1140:         summary_text = call_llm(f"Summarize the following file:\n{file_content}")
1141:         return (filename, summary_text)
1142: 
1143:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list):

1147:     def prep(self, shared):
1148:         return shared["file_summaries"]
1149: 
1150:     def exec(self, file_summaries):
1151:         # format as: "File1: summary\nFile2: summary...\n"
1152:         text_list = []
1153:         for fname, summ in file_summaries.items():
1154:             text_list.append(f"{fname} summary:\n{summ}\n")
1155:         big_text = "\n---\n".join(text_list)
1156: 
1157:         return call_llm(f"Combine these file summaries into one final summary:\n{big_text}")
1158: 
1159:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, final_summary):
1160:         shared["all_files_summary"] = final_summary
1161: 
1162: batch_node = SummarizeAllFiles()
1163: combine_node = CombineSummaries()
1164: batch_node >> combine_node
1165:

1170:         "file1.txt": "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister...",
1171:         "file2.txt": "Some other interesting text ...",
1172:         # ...
1173:     }
1174: }
1175: flow.run(shared)

1190: # RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
1191: 
1192: For certain LLM tasks like answering questions, providing relevant context is essential. One common architecture is a **two-stage** RAG pipeline:
1193: 
1194: <div align="center">
1195:   <img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow/raw/main/assets/rag.png?raw=true" width="400"/>
1196: </div>
1197: 
1198: 1. **Offline stage**: Preprocess and index documents ("building the index").
1199: 2. **Online stage**: Given a question, generate answers by retrieving the most relevant context.
1200: 
1201: ---
1202: ## Stage 1: Offline Indexing
1203: 
1204: We create three Nodes:
1205: 1. `ChunkDocs` – [chunks](../utility_function/chunking.md) raw text.
1206: 2. `EmbedDocs` – [embeds](../utility_function/embedding.md) each chunk.
1207: 3. `StoreIndex` – stores embeddings into a [vector database](../utility_function/vector.md).
1208: 
1209: ```python
1210: class ChunkDocs(BatchNode):
1211:     def prep(self, shared):
1212:         # A list of file paths in shared["files"]. We process each file.
1213:         return shared["files"]
1214: 
1215:     def exec(self, filepath):
1216:         # read file content. In real usage, do error handling.
1217:         with open(filepath, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
1218:             text = f.read()
1219:         # chunk by 100 chars each
1220:         chunks = []
1221:         size = 100
1222:         for i in range(0, len(text), size):
1223:             chunks.append(text[i : i + size])
1224:         return chunks
1225:     
1226:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list):
1227:         # exec_res_list is a list of chunk-lists, one per file.
1228:         # flatten them all into a single list of chunks.
1229:         all_chunks = []
1230:         for chunk_list in exec_res_list:
1231:             all_chunks.extend(chunk_list)
1232:         shared["all_chunks"] = all_chunks
1233: 
1234: class EmbedDocs(BatchNode):
1235:     def prep(self, shared):
1236:         return shared["all_chunks"]
1237: 
1238:     def exec(self, chunk):
1239:         return get_embedding(chunk)
1240: 
1241:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list):
1242:         # Store the list of embeddings.
1243:         shared["all_embeds"] = exec_res_list
1244:         print(f"Total embeddings: {len(exec_res_list)}")
1245: 
1246: class StoreIndex(Node):
1247:     def prep(self, shared):
1248:         # We'll read all embeds from shared.
1249:         return shared["all_embeds"]
1250: 
1251:     def exec(self, all_embeds):
1252:         # Create a vector index (faiss or other DB in real usage).
1253:         index = create_index(all_embeds)
1254:         return index
1255: 
1256:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, index):
1257:         shared["index"] = index
1258: 
1259: # Wire them in sequence
1260: chunk_node = ChunkDocs()
1261: embed_node = EmbedDocs()
1262: store_node = StoreIndex()
1263: 
1264: chunk_node >> embed_node >> store_node
1265: 
1266: OfflineFlow = Flow(start=chunk_node)
1267: ```
1268: 
1269: Usage example:
1270: 
1271: ```python
1272: shared = {
1273:     "files": ["doc1.txt", "doc2.txt"],  # any text files
1274: }
1275: OfflineFlow.run(shared)
1276: ```
1277: 
1278: ---
1279: ## Stage 2: Online Query & Answer
1280: 
1281: We have 3 nodes:
1282: 1. `EmbedQuery` – embeds the user’s question.
1283: 2. `RetrieveDocs` – retrieves top chunk from the index.
1284: 3. `GenerateAnswer` – calls the LLM with the question + chunk to produce the final answer.
1285: 
1286: ```python
1287: class EmbedQuery(Node):
1288:     def prep(self, shared):
1289:         return shared["question"]
1290: 
1291:     def exec(self, question):
1292:         return get_embedding(question)
1293:

1296: 
1297: class RetrieveDocs(Node):
1298:     def prep(self, shared):
1299:         # We'll need the query embedding, plus the offline index/chunks
1300:         return shared["q_emb"], shared["index"], shared["all_chunks"]
1301: 
1302:     def exec(self, inputs):
1303:         q_emb, index, chunks = inputs
1304:         I, D = search_index(index, q_emb, top_k=1)
1305:         best_id = I[0][0]
1306:         relevant_chunk = chunks[best_id]
1307:         return relevant_chunk
1308: 
1309:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, relevant_chunk):
1310:         shared["retrieved_chunk"] = relevant_chunk
1311:         print("Retrieved chunk:", relevant_chunk[:60], "...")
1312: 
1313: class GenerateAnswer(Node):
1314:     def prep(self, shared):
1315:         return shared["question"], shared["retrieved_chunk"]
1316: 
1317:     def exec(self, inputs):
1318:         question, chunk = inputs
1319:         prompt = f"Question: {question}\nContext: {chunk}\nAnswer:"
1320:         return call_llm(prompt)
1321: 
1322:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, answer):
1323:         shared["answer"] = answer
1324:         print("Answer:", answer)
1325: 
1326: embed_qnode = EmbedQuery()
1327: retrieve_node = RetrieveDocs()
1328: generate_node = GenerateAnswer()
1329: 
1330: embed_qnode >> retrieve_node >> generate_node
1331: OnlineFlow = Flow(start=embed_qnode)
1332: ```
1333: 
1334: Usage example:
1335: 
1336: ```python
1337: # Suppose we already ran OfflineFlow and have:
1338: # shared["all_chunks"], shared["index"], etc.
1339: shared["question"] = "Why do people like cats?"
1340: 
1341: OnlineFlow.run(shared)

1354: 
1355: # Structured Output
1356: 
1357: In many use cases, you may want the LLM to output a specific structure, such as a list or a dictionary with predefined keys.
1358: 
1359: There are several approaches to achieve a structured output:
1360: - **Prompting** the LLM to strictly return a defined structure.
1361: - Using LLMs that natively support **schema enforcement**.
1362: - **Post-processing** the LLM's response to extract structured content.
1363: 
1364: In practice, **Prompting** is simple and reliable for modern LLMs.
1365: 
1366: ### Example Use Cases
1367: 
1368: - Extracting Key Information 
1369: 
1370: ```yaml
1371: product:
1372:   name: Widget Pro
1373:   price: 199.99
1374:   description: |
1375:     A high-quality widget designed for professionals.
1376:     Recommended for advanced users.
1377: ```
1378: 
1379: - Summarizing Documents into Bullet Points
1380: 
1381: ```yaml
1382: summary:
1383:   - This product is easy to use.
1384:   - It is cost-effective.
1385:   - Suitable for all skill levels.
1386: ```
1387: 
1388: - Generating Configuration Files
1389: 
1390: ```yaml
1391: server:
1392:   host: 127.0.0.1
1393:   port: 8080
1394:   ssl: true
1395: ```
1396: 
1397: ## Prompt Engineering
1398: 
1399: When prompting the LLM to produce **structured** output:
1400: 1. **Wrap** the structure in code fences (e.g., `yaml`).
1401: 2. **Validate** that all required fields exist (and let `Node` handles retry).
1402: 
1403: ### Example Text Summarization
1404: 
1405: ```python
1406: class SummarizeNode(Node):
1407:     def exec(self, prep_res):
1408:         # Suppose `prep_res` is the text to summarize.
1409:         prompt = f"""
1410: Please summarize the following text as YAML, with exactly 3 bullet points
1411: 
1412: {prep_res}
1413: 
1414: Now, output:
1415: ```yaml
1416: summary:
1417:   - bullet 1
1418:   - bullet 2
1419:   - bullet 3
1420: ```"""
1421:         response = call_llm(prompt)
1422:         yaml_str = response.split("```yaml")[1].split("```")[0].strip()
1423: 
1424:         import yaml
1425:         structured_result = yaml.safe_load(yaml_str)

1436: ### Why YAML instead of JSON?
1437: 
1438: Current LLMs struggle with escaping. YAML is easier with strings since they don't always need quotes.
1439: 
1440: **In JSON**  
1441: 
1442: ```json
1443: {
1444:   "dialogue": "Alice said: \"Hello Bob.\\nHow are you?\\nI am good.\""
1445: }
1446: ```
1447: 
1448: - Every double quote inside the string must be escaped with `\"`.
1449: - Each newline in the dialogue must be represented as `\n`.
1450: 
1451: **In YAML**  
1452: 
1453: ```yaml
1454: dialogue: |
1455:   Alice said: "Hello Bob.
1456:   How are you?
1457:   I am good."
1458: ```
1459: 
1460: - No need to escape interior quotes—just place the entire text under a block literal (`|`).
1461: - Newlines are naturally preserved without needing `\n`.

1473: # Workflow
1474: 
1475: Many real-world tasks are too complex for one LLM call. The solution is to **Task Decomposition**: decompose them into a [chain](../core_abstraction/flow.md) of multiple Nodes.

1479: </div>
1480: 
1481: > - You don't want to make each task **too coarse**, because it may be *too complex for one LLM call*.
1482: > - You don't want to make each task **too granular**, because then *the LLM call doesn't have enough context* and results are *not consistent across nodes*.
1483: > 
1484: > You usually need multiple *iterations* to find the *sweet spot*. If the task has too many *edge cases*, consider using [Agents](./agent.md).

1487: ### Example: Article Writing
1488:

1492:     def exec(self, topic): return call_llm(f"Create a detailed outline for an article about {topic}")
1493:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res): shared["outline"] = exec_res
1494: 
1495: class WriteSection(Node):
1496:     def prep(self, shared): return shared["outline"]
1497:     def exec(self, outline): return call_llm(f"Write content based on this outline: {outline}")
1498:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res): shared["draft"] = exec_res
1499: 
1500: class ReviewAndRefine(Node):
1501:     def prep(self, shared): return shared["draft"]
1502:     def exec(self, draft): return call_llm(f"Review and improve this draft: {draft}")
1503:     def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res): shared["final_article"] = exec_res
1504: 
1505: # Connect nodes
1506: outline = GenerateOutline()
1507: write = WriteSection()
1508: review = ReviewAndRefine()
1509: 
1510: outline >> write >> review
1511: 
1512: # Create and run flow
1513: writing_flow = Flow(start=outline)
1514: shared = {"topic": "AI Safety"}
1515: writing_flow.run(shared)
1516: ```
1517: 
1518: For *dynamic cases*, consider using [Agents](./agent.md).

1533: Here, we provide some minimal example implementations:
1534: 
1535: 1. OpenAI
1536:     ```python
1537:     def call_llm(prompt):

1545: 
1546:     # Example usage
1547:     call_llm("How are you?")
1548:     ```
1549:     > Store the API key in an environment variable like OPENAI_API_KEY for security.

1552: 2. Claude (Anthropic)
1553:     ```python

1559:             messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
1560:             max_tokens=100
1561:         )
1562:         return response.content
1563:     ```
1564: 
1565: 3. Google (Generative AI Studio / PaLM API)
1566:     ```python
1567:     def call_llm(prompt):
1568:         import google.generativeai as genai
1569:         genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
1570:         response = genai.generate_text(

1572:             prompt=prompt
1573:         )
1574:         return response.result
1575:     ```
1576: 
1577: 4. Azure (Azure OpenAI)
1578:     ```python
1579:     def call_llm(prompt):
1580:         from openai import AzureOpenAI
1581:         client = AzureOpenAI(

1600:         )
1601:         return response.message.content
1602:     ```
1603: 
1604: ## Improvements
1605: Feel free to enhance your `call_llm` function as needed. Here are examples:
1606: 
1607: - Handle chat history:
1608: 
1609: ```python
1610: def call_llm(messages):
1611:     from openai import OpenAI
1612:     client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
1613:     r = client.chat.completions.create(
1614:         model="gpt-4o",
1615:         messages=messages
1616:     )
1617:     return r.choices[0].message.content
1618: ```
1619: 
1620: - Add in-memory caching 
1621: 
1622: ```python
1623: from functools import lru_cache
1624: 
1625: @lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
1626: def call_llm(prompt):
1627:     # Your implementation here
1628:     pass
1629: ```
1630: 
1631: > ⚠️ Caching conflicts with Node retries, as retries yield the same result.
1632: >
1633: > To address this, you could use cached results only if not retried.
1634: {: .warning }
1635: 
1636: 
1637: ```python
1638: from functools import lru_cache
1639: 
1640: @lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
1641: def cached_call(prompt):
1642:     pass
1643: 
1644: def call_llm(prompt, use_cache):
1645:     if use_cache:
1646:         return cached_call(prompt)
1647:     # Call the underlying function directly
1648:     return cached_call.__wrapped__(prompt)
1649: 
1650: class SummarizeNode(Node):
1651:     def exec(self, text):
1652:         return call_llm(f"Summarize: {text}", self.cur_retry==0)
1653: ```
1654: 
1655: - Enable logging:
1656: 
1657: ```python
1658: def call_llm(prompt):
1659:     import logging
1660:     logging.info(f"Prompt: {prompt}")
1661:     response = ... # Your implementation here
1662:     logging.info(f"Response: {response}")
1663:     return response

598: Instructions for the chapter (Generate content in {language.capitalize()} unless specified otherwise):
599: - Start with a clear heading (e.g., `# Chapter {chapter_num}: {abstraction_name}`). Use the provided concept name.
600: - If this is not the first chapter, begin with a brief transition from the previous chapter{instruction_lang_note}, referencing it with a proper Markdown link using its name{link_lang_note}.
601: - Begin with a high-level motivation explaining what problem this abstraction solves{instruction_lang_note}. Start with a central use case as a concrete example. The whole chapter should guide the reader to understand how to solve this use case. Make it very minimal and friendly to beginners.
602: - If the abstraction is complex, break it down into key concepts. Explain each concept one-by-one in a very beginner-friendly way{instruction_lang_note}.
603: - Explain how to use this abstraction to solve the use case{instruction_lang_note}. Give example inputs and outputs for code snippets (if the output isn't values, describe at a high level what will happen{instruction_lang_note}).
604: - Each code block should be BELOW 10 lines! If longer code blocks are needed, break them down into smaller pieces and walk through them one-by-one. Aggresively simplify the code to make it minimal. Use comments{code_comment_note} to skip non-important implementation details. Each code block should have a beginner friendly explanation right after it{instruction_lang_note}.
605: - Describe the internal implementation to help understand what's under the hood{instruction_lang_note}. First provide a non-code or code-light walkthrough on what happens step-by-step when the abstraction is called{instruction_lang_note}. It's recommended to use a simple sequenceDiagram with a dummy example - keep it minimal with at most 5 participants to ensure clarity. If participant name has space, use: `participant QP as Query Processing`. {mermaid_lang_note}.
606: - Then dive deeper into code for the internal implementation with references to files. Provide example code blocks, but make them similarly simple and beginner-friendly. Explain{instruction_lang_note}.
607: - IMPORTANT: When you need to refer to other core abstractions covered in other chapters, ALWAYS use proper Markdown links like this: [Chapter Title](filename.md). Use the Complete Tutorial Structure above to find the correct filename and the chapter title{link_lang_note}. Translate the surrounding text.
608: - Use mermaid diagrams to illustrate complex concepts (```mermaid``` format). {mermaid_lang_note}.
609: - Heavily use analogies and examples throughout{instruction_lang_note} to help beginners understand.
610: - End the chapter with a brief conclusion that summarizes what was learned{instruction_lang_note} and provides a transition to the next chapter{instruction_lang_note}. If there is a next chapter, use a proper Markdown link: [Next Chapter Title](next_chapter_filename){link_lang_note}.
611: - Ensure the tone is welcoming and easy for a newcomer to understand{tone_note}.
612: - Output *only* the Markdown content for this chapter.
613: Now, directly provide a super beginner-friendly Markdown output (DON'T need ```markdown``` tags):

 76: 
 77: ## 🚀 Getting Started
 78: 
 79: 1. Clone this repository
 80:    ```bash
 81:    git clone https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow-Tutorial-Codebase-Knowledge
 82:    ```
 83: 
 84: 3. Install dependencies:
 85:    ```bash
 86:    pip install -r requirements.txt
 87:    ```
 88: 
 89: 4. Set up LLM in [`utils/call_llm.py`](./utils/call_llm.py) by providing credentials. By default, you can use the [AI Studio key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) with this client for Gemini Pro 2.5:
 90: 
 91:    ```python
 92:    client = genai.Client(
 93:      api_key=os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY", "your-api_key"),
 94:    )
 95:    ```
 96: 
 97:    You can use your own models. We highly recommend the latest models with thinking capabilities (Claude 3.7 with thinking, O1). You can verify that it is correctly set up by running:
 98:    ```bash
 99:    python utils/call_llm.py
100:    ```
101: 
102: 5. Generate a complete codebase tutorial by running the main script:
103:     ```bash
104:     # Analyze a GitHub repository
105:     python main.py --repo https://github.com/username/repo --include "*.py" "*.js" --exclude "tests/*" --max-size 50000
106: 
107:     # Or, analyze a local directory
108:     python main.py --dir /path/to/your/codebase --include "*.py" --exclude "*test*"
109: 
110:     # Or, generate a tutorial in Chinese
111:     python main.py --repo https://github.com/username/repo --language "Chinese"
112:     ```
113: 
114:     - `--repo` or `--dir` - Specify either a GitHub repo URL or a local directory path (required, mutually exclusive)
115:     - `-n, --name` - Project name (optional, derived from URL/directory if omitted)
116:     - `-t, --token` - GitHub token (or set GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable)
117:     - `-o, --output` - Output directory (default: ./output)
118:     - `-i, --include` - Files to include (e.g., "`*.py`" "`*.js`")
119:     - `-e, --exclude` - Files to exclude (e.g., "`tests/*`" "`docs/*`")
120:     - `-s, --max-size` - Maximum file size in bytes (default: 100KB)
121:     - `--language` - Language for the generated tutorial (default: "english")
122:     - `--max-abstractions` - Maximum number of abstractions to identify (default: 10)
123:     - `--no-cache` - Disable LLM response caching (default: caching enabled)
124: 
125: The application will crawl the repository, analyze the codebase structure, generate tutorial content in the specified language, and save the output in the specified directory (default: ./output).

129:  
130: <summary> 🐳 <b>Running with Docker</b> </summary>
131: 
132: To run this project in a Docker container, you'll need to pass your API keys as environment variables. 
133: 
134: 1. Build the Docker image
135:    ```bash
136:    docker build -t pocketflow-app .
137:    ```
138: 
139: 2. Run the container
140: 
141:    You'll need to provide your `GEMINI_API_KEY` for the LLM to function. If you're analyzing private GitHub repositories or want to avoid rate limits, also provide your `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
142:    
143:    Mount a local directory to `/app/output` inside the container to access the generated tutorials on your host machine.
144:    
145:    **Example for analyzing a public GitHub repository:**
146:    
147:    ```bash
148:    docker run -it --rm \
149:      -e GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" \
150:      -v "$(pwd)/output_tutorials":/app/output \
151:      pocketflow-app --repo https://github.com/username/repo
152:    ```
153:    
154:    **Example for analyzing a local directory:**
155:    
156:    ```bash
157:    docker run -it --rm \
158:      -e GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" \
159:      -v "/path/to/your/local_codebase":/app/code_to_analyze \
160:      -v "$(pwd)/output_tutorials":/app/output \
161:      pocketflow-app --dir /app/code_to_analyze
162:    ```

165: ## 💡 Development Tutorial
166: 
167: - I built using [**Agentic Coding**](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/agentic-coding-the-most-fun-way-to), the fastest development paradigm, where humans simply [design](docs/design.md) and agents [code](flow.py).
168: 
169: - The secret weapon is [Pocket Flow](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow), a 100-line LLM framework that lets Agents (e.g., Cursor AI) build for you
