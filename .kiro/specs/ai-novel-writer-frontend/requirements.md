# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Novel Writer Frontend is a modern web application built with Next.js and Vercel AI SDK 5 that provides an intuitive, responsive user interface for the AI Novel Writer system. This frontend will connect to the existing Python backend via API endpoints, offering authors a seamless web-based writing experience with real-time AI assistance, project management, and collaborative features. The application emphasizes user experience, performance, and accessibility while maintaining the full functionality of the AI writing assistant.
